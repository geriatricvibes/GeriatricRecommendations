	"description": "Admitted into a prestigious boarding school where boys of Alpha supremacy study, Yuzuki’s body is suddenly assaulted. His body which should have been an Alpha had changed into an Omega. In the midst of estrus, the sweet honey (pheromones) that overflows from him induces the Alphas’ lust, his classmates run their tongues all over his body, play-biting and naturally taking their lust out on him. Even though he should hate it, feeling their caress, the hole on his butt throbs and not knowing who’s penis it was, just as it was about to be inserted, he is rescued by his Beta dormitory roommate, Albert. However, Yuzuki’s body has yet to settle down from estrus. In an abandoned clock tower, his arousal pushes Albert into teasing out Yuzuki’s seductive voice as he inserts his arousal into him… V! (Victory sign)\r\n\r\nAs his heated body is appeased, Yuzuki and Albert are attracted to each other. But it appears that Jeremy, an Alpha and head of the dormitory who looks at them with disdain is actually Yuzuki’s [fated pair]?>"
