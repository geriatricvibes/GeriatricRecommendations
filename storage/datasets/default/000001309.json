	"description": "Starting from today, I am retired. But what should I be doing? I neither have the skills, nor the mind to do business, my only advantage is this pair of hands which have taken this world. What a headache…\r\n\r\nNote: The usage of the term 'retired' here doesn't mean retiring from old age, work etc. It's a specific term to refer to not involving oneself in the affairs of a certain society.>"
