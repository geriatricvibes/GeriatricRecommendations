	"description": "“Don’t cry.”\n\nWith the first snow of the year as my witness, I promised something.\n\nI will be with you and we will walk out of this cold night, this most difficult part of our lives.\n\nThere isn’t any hardship that is impassable; there is no darkness that reaches the end of the world.\n\n“As long as we are hand in hand, heading forward together. ”\n\nIt was noon after a rainy morning.\n\nIt was a meeting filled with humidity.\n\nAt the beginning, no one had thought that two lives on parallel trajectories would suddenly change tracks and converge.\n\nHe is a driver who lives with his autistic brother.\n\nShe is a cold and aloof reporter.\n\nHe is like a winter cedar on the mountain,\n\nInconspicuous, monetarily worthless, but deep and tenacious.\n\nShe is more like a lonely and straight beam of light,\n\nShe knows the coldness of life, but she has never given up on grasping the wheel of fate in her own hands.\n\nShe is greedy for his inherently solid and rough existence. She also knew that behind him was the darkness of a fate she had been trying to escape all of her life.\n\nHowever, in the inadvertent breeze, who loved first?\n\nWho, after countless hesitations and sighs, decided to surrender to their heart?\n\nDid they advance and retreat together, hold hands, turn around to meet their fate?\n\nIf we can’t say goodbye with a smile,\n\nIs it possible to hug each other closely and jointly resist the cold torrent of this world?>"
