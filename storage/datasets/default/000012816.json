Remember that.”\r\n\r\nA perfect gentleman by day, dangerous fiend by night. Dr. Henry Jekyll from Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\r\n\r\n“You are the first woman I’ve met who has beautiful wrinkles in her brain.”\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes’s archenemy, the Napoleon of Crime. Professor James Moriarty.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t expect me to come back to life? I shall not die, not even for you.” Cthulhu’s creator, Lovecraft’s other self. Her husband Randolph Carter appeared ten years after his death.\r\n\r\nHowever, since she was given the task of hunting unknown, mysterious beings, so-called “monsters”, there was no time to think about love.\r\n\r\nTime passed.\r\n\r\n“How… What have I done?”\r\n\r\nEvery time she died and returned, memories that didn’t originally exist came back.>"
