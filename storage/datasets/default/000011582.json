	"description": "Big news: Fu Xuechen, the great God of mathematics department, is making friends with the little cutie of  the Chinese department.\r\n\r\nHer roommate pressed her: 'I heard that the great God is chasing you!!!'\r\n\r\nRan Xing with a blank face: 'He didn't chase me!'\r\n\r\nHer roommate asked, 'What is he looking for you?'\r\n\r\nRan Xing looked at the sleeping God: 'Lying on the desk next to me and sleeping.'\r\n\r\nRoommate: '...'\r\n\r\nFu Xuechen is a patient with severe insomnia. His dark circles are comparable to those of Gaara. He was prepared for sudden death long before he met Ran Xing.\r\n\r\nBut after one look, he fell asleep on his desk.\r\n\r\nHe simply asked for her timetable and slept next to her every day.\r\n\r\nLater, Ran Xing rented a house outside. Her roommate asked her for something and rang the bell. But Fu Xuechen, who was only wearing pajamas, opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe roommate quickly apologized: 'Sorry, I went to the wrong place.'\r\n\r\nFu Xuechen said lazily: 'You didn't go wrong. She's inside!'\r\n\r\nRoommate: '...'\r\n\r\nShe said that the great God did not chase her!!!\r\n>"
