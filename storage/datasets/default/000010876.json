	"description": "\r\nCount Erten, a reclusive, lonely man who always wears a mask on his face to cover the scars, and does not come out of the estate. \r\nBy marrying him, Velita escaped from her hateful father. The joy was also for a while. \r\n\r\nThis man, isn't easy to understand from the first night. He forcibly entered in the newlyweds room just to remove the wedding dress as an excuse, but he didn't even want to take off the mask, saying that he does not want to show his ugly face.\r\n\r\n'I'll wait until you take off the mask.'\r\n\r\nVelita decides to wait for him to open up and take off the mask. \r\n\r\nVelita eventually gets angry instead of Ian, who was stupidly getting teased instead of putting up a fight . 'Why did you insult my only rabbit-like husband?'\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
