	"description": "Ping Mo has been transferred from the Special Forces to the Alliance University, and the whole university is in an uproar. The new instructor, Ping Mo, is said to be a top alpha, with a lean waist, long legs, a nice ass, and a great sense of humor.\n\nThe little sweet omegas get weak at the sight of him.\n\nPei Yutu disdains: What’s so good about this f*cking little white guy?\n\nLater, Pei Yutu discovers Ping Mo’s little secret; He is an omega, a rare Therian omega!\n\nBig Pei pressed the man into the toilet stall, his teeth gently crushed his glands, looked at the flushed drill sergeant, squeezed the tail behind him, and laughed, “Damn! You’re so good everywhere!”>"
