	"description": "The planet was invaded by the Tates, and suffered from the devastation of the last ages. In the crisis of survival, some humans awakened powers, and they realised that those mutant beasts could cooperate with their own consciousness and increase their fighting power to two times more.\n\nThis kind of animal was called Warpet. Shu Xiaohui was somewhat different from others. When the Tates invaded, he became a hamster and silently felt the presense of another powerful person.\n\nChen Chengduo watched his companions slowly find their warpet, and wondered where his one was until one day he saw Shu Xiaohui with his mouth full of melon seeds in the corner of the wall…\n\nOthers were warpet, his was only just a pet right…\n\nHamster: You… You don’t look at my small size.  I have lucky BUFF!>"
