	"description": "When a glorious old civilization was toppled overnight, a strange purple moon rose and thus began the Purple Moon Era.\r\n\r\nDamn it! What kind of ecosystem was this? The evolution was messy. Even rabbit bites and plants were not to be messed with. How can one survive all this? Evolve into a Purple Moon Warrior? What did this have to do with the Purple Moon?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of map was this? The Safety Sector? The Floating Domain? The Darkness Port? The Storm Voyage? The True Capital?\r\n\r\nThe Horror Lullaby List? The resurrection of the Underground Tribe and the prospering Underground City? The Chaos Black Market that suffused the world? The Bloody Road?\r\n\r\nMore importantly, one could end up in a bloody slaughter when dreaming and enter the Dream Domain? Fine, this damned era!>"
