	"description": "Grandpa Yu often repeated beside the ear of Yu Zhen, saying that he has a soul in his body. If he doesn’t properly cultivate, and raise then send away the powerful soul, in this lifetime he would have to live as a bachelor. In his next lifetime he would be reborn as a livestock animal. \n\nYu Zhen played on his mobile and nodded. He replied, “Uh-huh” but in his heart he laughed, “hahaha”. Keeping his grandfather in the dark was amusing so the lie was repeated for over ten years without Yu Zhen getting tired of it.\n\nAfter some years, Grandpa Yu passed away and a cold-faced handsome guy came to his door in a luxury car – with a household register in hand.\n\n…..\n\nYu Zhen: The soul in my body reincarnated into someone else’s body to demand repayment, what should I do!>"
