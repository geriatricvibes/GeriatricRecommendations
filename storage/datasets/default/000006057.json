	"description": "Why did the Duke Staten family propose to me?’\n\nThe Staten family was one of the longest-established family of duke families in the empire. Blue blood that has a vast manor and strong wealth, and is closely entangled with the royal Family.\n\nIt was a family that the Lancaster Baron family, whose name was barely a noble rattle, could not even dream of.\n\nHowever, Nadia did not want such undeserved luck for a moment.\n\nDuke Staten never appeared in social circles, but ugly rumors abound around him. The most famous rumor is that he is a beast with neither blood nor tears.\n\nLike being over 2 meters tall, like a gorilla with a bushy hair, like eating a child, or enjoying a slaughter… … .\n\n*\n\nHiccup!\n\nNadia quickly shut her mouth. Her white cheeks were stained sadly red. Big green eyes trembled.\n\nHiccup! Huck, kook!\n\n“… … .”\n\n“… … .”\n\nMy husband’s eyes poured out.\n\nI want to run away… … . And it’s scary… … .\n\nOn the first night, Nadia fainted with fear and tension.>"
