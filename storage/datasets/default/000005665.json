	"description": "Possessing a maid was not enough, but even a second possession as a princess! \r\nAt first, I possessed the evil maid 'Lari', destined to die at the hands of the male lead 'Thierry'. In order to avoid my death, I took great care of the male lead and thought that I had made him a pure child. Until one day, without knowing why, I died.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n'The princess woke up!'\r\n\r\nBut when I opened my eyes, 7 years have passed.\r\nI'm even a princess?\r\n\r\n'This is my last offer. I will treasure the princess.'\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem was that Thierry, who had grown up in the meantime, came in and offered to take me to his own country.\r\nNo matter what misunderstanding there was, I didn't want to reveal to Thierry that I was 'Lari.' But what's wrong with him?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“…Are you afraid of me?”\r\n\r\nI stared at him with a blank expression on my face.\r\nThe red eyes facing me shook, and he lowered them as if avoiding my gaze.\r\n\r\n'I won't do anything you don't like. If there's anything you want, I'll do it.'\r\n\r\nHe continued his words nervously as if he was wary of me, and I looked at him, stunned even more. \r\n\r\n'Then...can you look at me?'>"
