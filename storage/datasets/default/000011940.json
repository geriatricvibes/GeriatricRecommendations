	"description": "“You’re exiled from this party, you’re a woman after all.”\n\n“What!?”\n\n“Women really should be recovery magic ‘healers’, after all. A sorcerer’s a bit…”\n\n“Whaaaaaatt!?!?!?”\n\nPutting in enough effort to spill blood, the female adventurer named Tanya who had finally reached the highest class of sorcery was one day abruptly told “because you’re a woman” as the reason to be kicked from her adventurer party.\n\nWhile barraging the now desperate wasteland with super-advanced magic, the legendary grand witch Laplace appeared and said,\n\n“You, shall we form a party?”\n\n“Seriously!?”\n\n“However, if you’re a sorcerer our characters will overlap so be a magic swordsman. The level will be maxed from the beginning.”\n\n“Seriously!?!?!? (while pulverizing a last-boss-class dragon)”\n\nThe grand witch (Legendary) and magic swordswoman (MAX Level) slapstick light-yuri adventure starts here!\n\nHuh? The adventurer school’s examination? Since I was a woman, points were deducted across the board (fumes).>"
