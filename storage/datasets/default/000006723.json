	"description": "Every night, in the elegant duchy, there was only the sound of scratching and biting each other.\n\n“You have to keep your hips straight. Why don’t you put my seeds in properly?”\n\n“Duke, ple, please…”\n\nHe hated his wife.\n\nKyle couldn’t possibly forgive her for smiling so innocently and saying she’ll be a good wife, along with having a cruel father…\n\nEven more so to himself, who covets her like that in heat.\n\n“To be a good wife, you have to do what you have to do. As well as having my child.”\n\nBut, the wife, who had always spread her legs docilely, dared to go against him.\n\n“What I want is not children. It’s a divorce.”\n\nNo, Rosalyn…\n\nYou are my wife.\n\nYour thoughts don’t matter.>"
