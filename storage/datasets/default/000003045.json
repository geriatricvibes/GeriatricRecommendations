	"description": "I forcibly occupied everything belonging to Ji Chenfeng, his status, family origins, and relatives…… Despite being completely aware that I am just a counterfeit, I nevertheless seized the magpie’s nest as a turtledove myself without any remorse. \n\nI was born with selfish genes flowing through my bones: greedy and shameless to the extreme; desiring to obtain everything for myself. Furthermore……I don’t intend to change. \n\nA notion of goodwill is accompanied by ulterior motives; a notion of greed is accompanied by repentance.\n\nWhen a scumbag is capable of loving someone, it’s perhaps the greatest retribution that god has bestowed upon them.>"
