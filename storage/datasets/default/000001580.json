	"description": "The setting for this story is a country town in 1970’s Japan. One day, Saijo-kun, one of the biggest trouble makers of our school, was caught speeding on his scooter. As his friends, “we” commenced our counterattack on the local resident police officer. Our opponent was a newly appointed, motivated, and young Chuzai-san (resident local police officer). Chuzai-san kept getting back at us with his clever counterattacks! To boot, this Chuzai-san had a young and beautiful wife! Our prank war escalated, and its circumstances wrapped the whole town in confusion. This is the heartwarming (?) story about “our” relationship with “Chuzai-san.”\r\n\r\nTwo volumes of novel were published in April 2007. A live action movie is also being planned.>"
