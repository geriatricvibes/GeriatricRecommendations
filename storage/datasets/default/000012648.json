	"description": "'Bebe' \r\n\r\nEven if you call me with such a lovely voice, I won't look at you lovingly. \r\n\r\n'It's not Bebe. It's Bebeana' \r\n\r\n'Okay. Bebeana. What did you do today?' \r\n\r\n'Why do you want to know?' \r\n\r\n'...' \r\n\r\nA moment of silence. Anyone would have freaked out when they saw me speaking rudely. Seeing that the emperor, no my father who directly listened to me had a very bad expression, it's clear that he was shocked and hurt. Yeah, you get hated when you say nonsense like this! \r\n\r\n'The child's wounds must have been big.' \r\n\r\n'...Huh?' \r\n\r\n'Come here. Bebe. I'll give you a hug. Hugging you like this will heal your wounds, right?' \r\n\r\nNope? Nope. That's not it. I'm not that hurt. I just said those words to you? Get angry! Hate me! But the misunderstanding led to misunderstanding. But uh... do you guys like sadistic things? The more I went out to avoid receiving any love, the more my father and brother became dynamic. Oh my god, these guys... are they M's?>"
