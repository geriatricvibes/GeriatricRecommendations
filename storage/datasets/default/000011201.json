He went to snap up the bargains.\r\n\r\nErlang Shen?!\r\n\r\nI heard there was a blind date and that if he dared not go, then that old mother of his would make a scene. So you understand?\r\n\r\nTaishang Laojun?!\r\n\r\nHis online shop was selling medicine pellets and got reported. The man was almost taken to the police station. He’s currently living in seclusion and keeping his head down.\r\n\r\nYou’re asking who I am?! Oh, I’m Nuwa.>"
