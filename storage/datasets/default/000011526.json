	"description": "Two years after graduation, Lin Tuo resigned from his job and returned to the countryside, trying to open a Martial Art school in this era where Martial Arts had declined. \n\nHowever, he never expected to find a mysterious Sandbox in his old house.\n\nOn the Sandbox, a modern city was constantly in motion. Upon closer inspection, he found that it was precisely the same as the city where he had worked and lived for years!\n\nLin Tuo leaned down curiously.\n\nEarth, in the center of a certain city.\n\nCountless citizens on the street raised their heads in astonishment and looked towards the sky.\n\n“I’m not mistaken, am I? How… how did a face appear in the sky?!”>"
