	"description": "I, as a skilled guild member, was tasked with breaking the Duke of Verwinte's wedding.\r\n\r\n'This marriage is invalid! I... have the Duke's child.'\r\n\r\nMy unexpected confession made quite a stir in the wedding reception hall.\r\n\r\n'It seems like the wedding will be ruined, so should I just leave?'\r\n\r\nJust as I was about to leave the wedding hall, Veriwinter approached me and said,\r\n\r\n'Honey, why are you so late?'\r\n\r\n'Ho- honey? Did you just call me honey?'\r\n\r\n“I almost got married for real.”\r\n\r\n'…?!'\r\n\r\n'Leaving our child behind.'\r\n\r\n…Excuse me but I have never seen you before!>"
