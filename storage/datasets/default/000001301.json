	"description": "I was summoned to a ruined world and received the ability to create various things. Since I don’t have a house to live in I will make a house. Since people are gathering at my house I will make a town. Since the town is being attacked by monsters I will make the strongest weapon and repel them. Using my infinitely charging magic power I will remake this world as I please.>"
