	"description": "Li Na’s appearance was as ordinary as her name, and her facial features were neither delicate nor unusual. The only thing she had to offer was her small round face that has been popular in the past two years…\r\n\r\nEven if she was easily lost in a crowd, she followed her mother’s chicken soup (advice) until she was twenty-two.\r\n\r\n‘Girls don’t need to be fair or beautiful, but they can’t be bad. You must have a kind heart.’\r\n\r\nSo she was kind-hearted, had done a lot of good deeds, and suddenly became a living Lei Feng. To what extent? From fighting a gangster on a bus to helping a fallen elderly and almost being scammed.\r\n\r\nUntil one night, she jumped off the Moon Bridge to save a man who committed suicide for love…\r\n\r\nA year later, the man appeared in front of her, as the general manager of a large corporation.\r\n\r\nHe put his arms around her, and said with a chuckle, “Benefactor, I have come to repay your favor.”\r\n\r\n“How will you repay me?”\r\n\r\nHe kissed the corner of her lips from behind: “Of course, I will repay it with my body.”\r\n\r\nIn short, the heroine looks ordinary, but is kind-hearted, and does good deeds everywhere to be a good person. Then she met a gentle and rich man who returned her favor with his body.\r\n\r\nEvery kind girl, no matter how you look, someone will love you.>"
