	"description": "Open your eyes; this is a mysterious new world.\n\nSteam boilers are blazing, driving humongous steel cities through dark winds and fog-covered wilderness. Predation, fuel collection and treasure hunting…\n\nThis is a land full of mysteries where countless glorious civilisations’ remains and legends from ancient times are buried.\n\nMechanical civilisation, magic civilisation, martial arts civilisation, transcendental civilisation… Wilderness hunters explore the ancient ruins and unearth the inheritance and treasures left by various ancient civilisations that litter the lands. They mingle to create a wonderful and fantastic steampunk mechanical era.\n\n……\n\nA dragon knight: “Isn’t that guy a doctor? How come his power is even greater than mine!”\n\nA grand priest: “I couldn’t save that man with my divine magic, but that guy actually saved him with a scalpel…”\n\nA fanatical fiend follower: “Is he a follower of my lord and is his body immortal?”\n\nRayne: “It takes great effort to produce miracles… I am a doctor of death as well as a tanky melee healer!”>"
