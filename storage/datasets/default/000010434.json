	"description": "「Miss Lorella Mayred. Our sincere congratulations on becoming a main character candidate.」\n\nThe day I notified my husband, the Grand Duke of the North, of my intention to get a divorce, a system window that suddenly popped up without any notice would completely change my life.\n\nIt said that if I couldn’t sell my shares and become the main character, I would die.\n\nTell me, does that even make any sense?!\n\nIn order to live, I would have to show ‘them’, who wanted to buy shares, what they wanted to see.\n\nIt couldn’t be helped then, I had no other choice.\n\nWhether it’s the obsessive Grand Duke of the North, the friendly Holy Knight’s Commander, or the reckless head of a guild, there’s no choice but to enjoy a deep romance with everyone!\n\n[Urgent Sale] Selling Lorella’s shares!>"
