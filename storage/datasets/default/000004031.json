	"description": "\n\nA witch who killed a couple hundreds of people. A rare murderer. The illegitimate child of the late Duke Amber. Beatrice Amber has returned thirteen times for unknown reasons.\n\n \n\nIn her first life, she was executed for killing a priest and in her second life, she was executed for murdering her husband. In one life, she left her family, lived in a remote land, and died of old age. She was murdered in another life, and another where she eventually killed herself.\n\n \n\nBut when she wakes up, it’s always back to the same time as always. At 9 a.m. in January, when she turned 18. Tired of everything, she lived her thirteenth life as a witch. I killed if I had to, and I killed when someone asked me to. Beatrice was notorious as a witch who killed more than 100 people and was executed once again.\n\n \n\nAnd I woke up again at 9 a.m. in January when I was 18 years old. I have to find a way to die.\n>"
