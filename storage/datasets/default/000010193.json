	"description": "'Living isn't fun anymore.'\r\n\r\nSo I decided to die. But before I could leave, in the last moments of my life...\r\n\r\n'Should we make life fun for you?'\r\n\r\nThe Vina people appeared in front of me.\r\n\r\nThey asked me to live.\r\n\r\nThey told me if I died, they'll die as well.\r\n\r\nDo they want to live for eternity?\r\n\r\n'We'll make you happy. So, don't die yet.'\r\n\r\n'If you pledge to be one of us, you can have all the money you'll ever need for the rest of your life.'\r\n\r\n'Love, just talk to us. What do you need?'\r\n\r\n'You can tell us everything you desire.'>"
