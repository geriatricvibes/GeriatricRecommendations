	"description": "On the opening day of Illusionary Moon, I realised that I had many more items in my inventory as compared to other players. One Shura Secret Codex, an Achievement Manual and also a really mysterious bracelet.\n\nI didn't know who gave me all these, I also didn't know what triggered the system bug. The only thing I knew was that this was the beginning!\n\nThe world will tremble because of me, the mountains and rivers will awaken for me. 700 million girls will be attracted to me, because I might really be the strongest character in this world!>"
