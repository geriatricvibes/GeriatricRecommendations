	"description": "Readers usually see that within a story, every male god will have a special woman in his heart, his vermillion mark, his glittering moonlight…\r\n\r\nThis person is definitely both beautiful and intelligent as well as good-natured. Only – for some reason, this person passed away early on, leaving an overwhelming sense of regret and agony for the male god, also tormenting the readers and causing them to forever be unable to forget her.\r\n\r\nLi Yuebai: Don’t cry, perhaps I can help somewhat.\r\n\r\nThis book is called #A hundred and one methods to change the death ending#\r\n\r\nSystem: Ehem ehem, even though you don’t have a golden finger, you still possess a high IQ!\r\n\r\nMind games! Brain hack! Straight path ahead!\r\n\r\nEnemies whatever, all dealt with!\r\n\r\nSchemes whatever, all destroyed!\r\n\r\nConsecutive victories… However, why the heck would I always be pushed down by the male lead, the boss, or the second male lead?\r\n\r\nEven realizing that they are all the same person at the end?>"
