	"description": "In this world, people are given a special ability called “Divine Grace” by the age of 12. At the age of 12, people are tested, and those who have obtained a “Grace” that is useful to the nation are given a scholarship to study in the Royal Capital.\n\nLuca from the Polka Village realized that he had been given a rare “Grace.” However, on the day he turned 12, it was mistakenly deemed as a minor ability, and so he spent his days as a hunter in the village.\n\nAbout three years later, his little brother was tested and was found to have a rare “Grace • Magician.” He was to leave the village and attend a Magic Academy. Luca was excited about his little brother’s bright future, but his little brother, Licht, uses the “squire quota” given to him by the academy to bring Luca with him.\n\nThis is the story of the adventures of a Big Brother who is a Master Archer and has certain special ability, and a Little Brother who is a genius Magician.>"
