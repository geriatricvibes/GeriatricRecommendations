	"description": "Ange, a Royal Magician, is looked down on by her peers despite her excellent ability because she's a commoner. To bear the loneliness, she closed her heart and lost her cute side. Ange was given a mission to save the world by defeating the Demon Lord May-Hem. In addition to this, she has to travel with Rex, a good-for-nothing knight who was born in a family of heroes, but has a fear of blood.>"
