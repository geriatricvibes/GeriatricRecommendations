	"description": "Many people suddenly find themselves in a white, empty space, where a God-like figure tells them that they are to be reincarnated and sent to another world known as Tesla. They are given a limited number of points to spend in various attributes, such as their race and abilities, which will determine their reincarnation into Tesla. The story follows a young boy sent there along with his clanmates from an MMORPG, and they plan to stick together and specialize into different skills, just like they did in-game. Although his clanmates and everyone else sent there are strangely accepting of the situation, he finds it too suspicious and decides to go his own separate way, balancing his points out to be an all-rounder instead of a healer. He leisurely goes about life in Tesla as an adventurer, but it slowly starts to seem like there was a reason behind them being sent there…>"
