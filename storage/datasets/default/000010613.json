	"description": "“You are going to raise that child.”\r\n\r\nThe baby's wailing rang out loudly as my father looked down on me coldly. My mother, who sat next to the corpse of my dead younger sister, was clinging tightly onto her body.\r\n\r\nIn front of my younger sister's withering corpse, I held onto her only daughter as I got kicked out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe only person I could go to was Maynus, my forgotten fiancé.\r\n\r\n“… Is this your child?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nThe look on his face told me that he didn't believe me.\r\nBut at least he didn't kick me out?\r\n\r\nGoodness, what do I do now?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI simply wanted to pay him back for his generosity as much as I could and then leave soon after.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to leave now.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?”\r\n\r\nHuh? Why is he asking?\r\n\r\n“I need to adjust my schedule in advance. I also need to pack our bags. Delerone must have a lot of luggage as well.”\r\n\r\nThis is weird…\r\n\r\n“Huh… Are you coming with me?”\r\n\r\nMaynus' face twisted into a frown, “Were you planning on leaving me here by myself?”\r\n\r\nAm I the only one who doesn't understand what in the world is going on…?>"
