	"description": "'If you're going to throw it away like this, just end it now.'\r\n\r\nA fierce gaze and other urgent pleas caught Hye-joo.\r\n\r\nIan's eyes were red looking at Hye-joo, who turned around without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe love I hoped to be the salvation of my bloody life...\r\n\r\nFinally pushed him to the abyss.\r\n\r\nAnd the years have gone by inexorably.\r\n\r\nIan longed to see her standing in front of him with the same face as three years ago.\r\n\r\n“With a heart to atone for abandoning me, stay by my side. Break it by my side.”\r\n\r\nIf you're unhappy, if you're broken like me, if you've struggled in hell like me. Please, I wish.\r\n\r\nIt was Ian's curse that she didn't know for three years.>"
