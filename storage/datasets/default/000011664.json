	"description": "When I first met the dukes daughter of the same age, who was going to be my fiancée, she screamed and collapsed after seeing my face! Eeeeeeee!? Whyyyyy!?\n\nYou remembered? You are a villainess? You will be ruined because of my cheating? Even if you say that to the 10 year old me while crying…..You are terrible, me from that story.\n\nThe thing is, there should be a lot of things that can be done so that something like that doesn’t happen. Let’s think about it together! Come on, trust me.\n\nThis is a love story of a prince and villainess who, from the age of 10, go against the cruel fate of an otome game’s story while being lovey-dovey, and fighting against the compelling force of the game while flirting.>"
