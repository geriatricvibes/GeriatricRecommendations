	"description": "Rakan, the man I loved, became emperor. Finally, at the coronation ceremony, I stood by him and expected to become the empress. However, the empress’s crown became that of my cousin, Viena, not me.\r\n\r\nI threw everything to make Rakan the emperor, and all that remains is death. It was only after I was abandoned that I knew he had used me.\r\n\r\nEverything was a ruse.\r\n\r\nA finely crafted script, the protagonists of it were my man Rakan and my cousin, Viena. I was the only one who didn’t know that.\r\n\r\nI stood at the end of my life and made a pledge. If there is another life, even if I die, I will not love you.\r\n\r\nMiraculously returned to the past!\r\n\r\nAt the age of 18, the day all the discord began. I pledged in tears. This time, I’ll give my all to destroy you, Rakan. In my pledge of revenge, I began to see something I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nAnd Vylando, my fiance who always looked at me. “Please be on my side. I don’t need love.”\r\n\r\nEven if you’re hanging on, it’s useless now!>"
