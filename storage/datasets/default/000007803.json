	"description": " I'm red. I'm a balloon. I'm the first spectrum of a rainbow.\r\n\r\nWhen you left, all you left me was a red balloon.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter. No matter how long, I won't give up loving you.\r\n\r\n——Xia Zhi Chen\r\n\r\nOnce I thought love was cruel, until I met a boy, I understand that love is not bitter entanglement, but I will do everything for his sake. The right thing I've done in my life is to love Xia Zhi Chen.\r\n\r\n——Li Xiang Wan>"
