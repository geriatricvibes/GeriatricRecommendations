	"description": "I possessed the body of a character from a novel that I threw away because I became angry while I was reading it. \n\nAs a young lady, I’ll be married off to the male lead at a young age. \n\nYou’d think it’ll be okay since the male lead was tamed well, but you’d be wrong.\n\nBecause there was a big problem with this body, which will become a saint in the future. \n\n‘Even if I have a strong power, I’m going to die because it’s too strong…!’\n\nThe only solution to prevent the surge in holy power was to suppress it with the opposite magical element. \n\nSo, goodbye male lead! I’m going to find a way to survive now!\n\n“I came here because I heard you’re good at magic.”\n\nThe Duke of Bastion, a demon family approved by the Royal family, was said to have inherited the blood of the demon god. \n\n“Give me your son!”\n\nAs of today, I’ll dwell here. No, I’ll live my life! >"
