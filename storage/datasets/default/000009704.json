It’s the worst and the best second-life high school rom-com ever.\r\n\r\nLove, friendship, and the sparkling joys of youth. The high school life that I’ve looked forward to- still ended with me being alone. Then, just a day before the graduation ceremony…\r\n\r\n“Don’t die! Nanamura-kun!”\r\n\r\nSora Hanamitsuji, she’s a beautiful girl that even models can’t compare. My life ended after getting hit by a truck to protect her. …That should’ve been the case.\r\n\r\n“It must be because the gods got bored.”\r\n\r\nHowever, with this accident, Hanamitsuji-san and I returned to the day of our high school’s entrance ceremony. The second high school life is no longer as charming and youthful. I was going to spend it modestly and alone. …But, she said that won’t do.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll help you make friends.”\r\n\r\nThis is a story about my second high school life. It’s the worst and best teenage rom-com ever.\r\n\r\n>"
