	"description": "She possessed the body of an extra as soon as the novel began. She was the incompetent guide of the male lead as well.\r\n\r\nAfter dying, she met the male lead to become his guide.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, she acted like she was dead after eating domestic poison to get out of the original plot safely.\r\n\r\n“My guide isn’t breathing anymore.”\r\n\r\n……?\r\n\r\n“Who the hell can stop me?”\r\n\r\nThe male lead awakened and went on a rampage?\r\n\r\nShe woke up to find out he awakened when she 'died'.\r\n\r\n“You can’t possibly awaken like this…”\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“Are you going to leave me?” Bliss laughed at Shana’s resignation letter, “Is this a joke?”\r\n\r\n“Young Master doesn’t need a guide anymore…”\r\n\r\n“Shana.”\r\n\r\nBliss called her in a soft but determined voice.\r\n\r\n“You can make me laugh, you can make me look like a fool, you can fool me as much as you want. Don’t tell me you are leaving me as a joke.”\r\n\r\nBliss smiled beautifully and whispered to Shana.\r\n\r\n“No matter what, I can’t let that slide.”>"
