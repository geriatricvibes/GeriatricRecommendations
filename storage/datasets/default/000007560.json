	"description": "The most awesome thing that the timid and shy Wen Zhichu did in his life was to save two elementary school students who were crossing the road recklessly. For the first time in his life, he had successfully tried to show his bravery. In the process, he also successfully died.\n\nWhen he woke up again, he found that he had transmigrated into the book as a cannon fodder villain who repeatedly kept making trouble for the protagonist, and finally because of offending the protagonist, he was forced to sleep on the streets.\n\nSince he was a child, his mother had told him that his body was delicate.\n\nWen Zhichu, who couldn’t sleep on the street: !!!!!\n\nJust when Wen Zhichu planned to not participate in the plot at all, he was accidentally bound to a villain system. If he didn’t make trouble for the protagonist according to the original plot, his money would be deducted, and he will have to go to sleep on the streets earlier than in the original text.\n\nWen Zhichu: : )\n\nWen Zhichu was forced to follow the path of the villain, and every time he saw the protagonist’s strong body, his calf trembled. The protagonist’s single punch looked like it was enough to kill two Wen Zhichus.\n\nVillain’s Mission: Destroy the protagonist’s lunch.>"
