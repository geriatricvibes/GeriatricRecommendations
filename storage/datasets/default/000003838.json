	"description": "Betrothed when still in womb by parents, Ai Changhuan is forced to marry a man of 37! Naturally, she wants to run away. However, right before her escape, she finds that this guy is probably gay who shows no interest in a woman.\n\nRelieved, she decides to stay.\n\nNever has she expected this man with gentle smiles is actually cunning and scheming in heart. Holding her in arms, he smiles, his tone indulgent and domineering, “Honey, be a good girl and stay by my side. One day as my wife, and you’ll forever be my sweet wife.”\n\nOnly then does she realize that she has been wrong from the very beginning. She jumps to him and scratches him hard out of rage.>"
