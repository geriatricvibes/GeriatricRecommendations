	"description": "Su Fu’s years of affections were gradually consumed by daily livings and the disgust of He Shaoqi’s parents. Father He’s indifference, Mother He’s unkindness and He Shaoqi’s infidelity finally made Su Fu feel unbearable and choose to break up.\r\n\r\nNext: the next love, the next lover, the next family, the next – is Tang Sibo, is happiness.\r\n\r\nSu Fu: I can’t even live well in an ordinary family. I can’t afford to live a life in such a prestigious family as yours.\r\n\r\nTang Sibo: It doesn’t matter what kind of family mine is. The two of us will live our own lives. No matter how prestigious my family is, I will protect you.\r\n\r\nSu Fu felt that the most correct choice he made and the greatest happiness he had in his life was to live a life with the surname Tang and a life worthy of himself.>"
