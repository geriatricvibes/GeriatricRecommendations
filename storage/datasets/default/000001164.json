	"description": "Asakura Souji fell that day. Souji was an ordinary high school student. He was average in everything and his only skill was housework. One day, on the school’s rooftop, he tried to save a girl, a complete stranger. He protected her with his body and died. Or so he thought. Now he had been reincarnated as a baby into what seems to be a fantasy world and now it seems that he’s going to be a butler.\n\nNote : the author stopped updating the web novel, and the light novel focus on a different character.>"
