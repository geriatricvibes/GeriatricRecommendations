	"description": "Lady Lariette is diagnosed with a disease which gives her a three-month deadline. 'Since I am going to die, I might as well go crazy!” It started with screwing her fiancé and having a relationship with the monster duke. But she didn't realize it until it was too late. There was no time limit and it was a misdiagnosis! Mr. Asrazan smiled brightly, “If you try to run away now, you will face consequences.”>"
