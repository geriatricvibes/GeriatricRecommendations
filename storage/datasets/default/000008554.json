	"description": "Song Fei’s university life was nothing special. He took his compulsory courses, skipped his elective courses, and took the CET-4 and CET-6. \n\nIf he had to point out one thing that was bothering him, it’d be his “bad penny”, academic tyrant ex-boyfriend— Qi Yan. As the saying goes, exes, like villains, are hard to raise: too close and they’re impertinent; too far, then there’s resentment. \n\nHe thought his university life would pass by uneventfully just like this, until that day, when an infected classmate rushed into the examination hall…\n\nThe zombie virus spread like wildfire. All communication was cut. Campus turned into hell. \n\nNo one knew what the outside world was like. And no one knew if they should “persevere and wait for rescue” or “break through the heavy encirclement”. \n\nSong Fei chose the latter. Qi Yan actually became a comrade-in-arms. \n\nWithout the power to exterminate everything in sight, without a martial arts expert’s physique, on this once familiar campus, they can only rely on their own knowledge and tenacity to fight for survival!>"
