	"description": "In the Interstellar era where the strong are king, soft and cute species are almost all extinct.\n\nTu Mianmian, who crossed over, was given a ruthless Duke husband, a husband who could destroy Mechas in minutes. \n\nAs a lop-eared rabbit who had just refined his human shape, he felt weak, pitiful and helpless.\n\nSo, he resolutely ran into the entertainment circle, relying on his sky-defying appearance to garner large amounts of fans from interstellar society, including his own gong/husband.\n\nIt was night, and the Duke who was going to improve the relationship between husband and wife walked to the door and saw a fluffy lop-eared rabbit lying on the sofa…\n\nWhen Tu Mianmian found himself sleeping beside his gong with his rabbit body stretched out, he scared himself. Sitting up in shock and dazed, he unconsciously stomped the Duke’s mouth. Shivering, he retracted his rabbit paw, but was caught by his gong with a cold face.\n\nTu Mianmian: …I, I, I am willing to cut off this rabbit’s paw!\n\nBefore he could finish speaking, the iron-blooded Lord Duke approached his mouth at the speed of light: Chuu~~ ( ˘ ³ ˘)♥>"
