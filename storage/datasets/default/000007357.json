	"description": "A former villainess who died after frivolously messing up the love between the male and female lead, Lilith.\n They say you’ll pay for it if you do evil deeds, and Lilith became a side character in a novel who gets abused by her stepmother and gets married off to a trashy man. Determined to live kindly this time, Lilith recruits the worst villain to teach her stepmother and stepsisters a lesson.\n\n “So you’re telling me to create a scene while pretending to be your lover.” \n“Exactly! If they get treated terribly they’ll live kind lives too. Like me!” \n\nThe villain is really good at his job. Now the only thing left is to take care of the stepmother and the baron and live kindly and quietly like a side character would. But I’ll give this man a hint since I’m grateful. \n“Don’t ever start an unrequited love unless you want to mess up your life.”\n “You think I’m going to love someone unrequitedly? I doubt it.”\n\n He ignored the warning of a former villainess! I was about to tell him you can’t just decide easily like that, but he folded his eyes and said “Why would I need to love someone unrequitedly when I already have a lover?”>"
