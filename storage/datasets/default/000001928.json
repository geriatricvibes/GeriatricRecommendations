	"description": "Every novel has a slag character, the one who decides to abandon the protagonist at his lowest, most helpless point, either because he can’t stand the poor guy’s circumstances or for other reasons. But after the protagonist wins his way in life again, they’re the ones who beg with broken sobs to be taken back. \n\nStill, water once spilled can’t be recovered again.\n\nYet the unlucky Shen Jiayan has been bound to a Water Recovery* System to do just that.\n\n*water recovery – comes from an idiom that means “spilled water can’t be recovered” (English equivalent: there’s no use crying over spilt milk).>"
