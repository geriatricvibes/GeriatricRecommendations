	"description": "He Bai won the lottery, became rich, and reached the pinnacle of life. Then, he inadvertently took a picture of the Film Emperor Di Qiuhe being killed. And after reporting this case to the police, he was reborn in a midst of confusion.\n\nHe Bai: I don’t have any horrible relatives to abuse. Why was I reborn?\n\nDi Qiuhe: But I do.\n\nHe Bai: I also haven’t been betrayed or harmed by anyone. Why was I reborn?\n\nDi Qiuhe: But I have.\n\nHe Bai: I just want to have some money to live freely and eat well. I already achieved that goal, so why was I reborn?\n\nDi Qiuhe: I have money, but don’t live freely or well.\n\nHe Bai angrily flips the table: So what’s the use of my rebirth! Just to make me suffer again?!\n\nDi Qiuhe (Holding and Touching He Bai): Be my lover, you’re only responsible for eating “lollipops,” you won’t eat any bitterness.\n\nHe Bai: Leave!>"
