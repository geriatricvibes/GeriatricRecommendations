	"description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI heard that it's hard to see S-class hunters in my life, but all my family members are S-class!\r\nA celebrity family who is more famous than other celebrities, that is my house.\r\nExcept for me, Jung Haeun, who is 100% civilian and not even registered as a hunter.\r\n\r\nPeople say that I'm the ugly duckling, but I'm actually quite comfortable and I like it.\r\nI'm enjoying my life as a rich and unemployed person.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are facts that the world, even my family members, do not know.\r\n\r\n[The constellation 'The Mutant of the Abyss’ is whining: please, let's debut.]\r\n[As soon as Haeun debut, it shouted that she would be the world's No. 0 poker face.]\r\n'I don't want to. It's annoying. I’m perfectly fine being treated like a civilian.'\r\n\r\nThat I am the only EX-class in the world.\r\nI am living a hard life because of my private circumstances.\r\nI want to live forever drinking honey like this.\r\nBut…\r\n\r\n[‘The Mutant of the Abyss’ will make Haeun debut no matter what.]\r\n\r\nI've been avoiding my debut path well, but somehow the situation is ominous these days.\r\n>"
