	"description": "The Duke of Vichen has three daughters.\r\n\r\nCaria, the eldest with a gorgeous appearance reminiscent of a rose,\r\nCordelia, the elegant and lovely youngest, \r\nGerania, the smart yet mediocre and quiet middle child.\r\n\r\nUnlike her older and younger sister, who were the flowers of society that set many men's hearts aflutter, Gerania grew up hearing that she was ordinary. \r\n\r\nDue to her mild and carefree personality, Gerania, who had grown up without standing out and lived her life in her own way happily, faced something unexpected.\r\n\r\n“What did you just say?”\r\n\r\n“I said to marry me.”\r\n\r\nShe was proposed to by the crown prince of this country, Franz Rinaun.\r\n\r\nWhy does he want to marry a woman that he has only met a few times?\r\n\r\nShe politely declined because she had no intention of marrying, but this man was much more persistent than she had thought.\r\n\r\n“If you accept this marriage, on the name of the royal family, I will fulfill a request from you, as long as it’s acceptable to me.” \r\n\r\n'…First, let's draft a contract.”\r\n\r\nThe wedding biography of the calm and unexpectedly bright Gerania and the blunt Prince Franz!\r\n\r\n>"
