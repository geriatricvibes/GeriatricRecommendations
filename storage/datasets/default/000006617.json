	"description": "Liang Yan, an 18th-line actress, accidentally lost her memory and woke up as a third-line actress with a husband. \r\n\r\nHer husband happened to be the entertainment industry’s top actor and national husband, Lu Lincheng. \r\n\r\nLiang Yan’s legs trembled, and she leaned on the wall. \r\n\r\n“Is this… Is this true?” 　\r\n\r\nLu Lincheng rolled the lighter in his hand, playing with it as he watched the fearful woman. He frowned, feeling unpleasant, and sarcastically replied, “What are you scheming again?”　　\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t a secret that Lu Lincheng was like an extremely cold iceberg to his wife, Liang Yan. Apart from announcing the marriage, he never talked about it publicly. 　\r\n\r\nThe entertainment industry waited for Lu Lincheng and Liang Yan to divorce. To the third line actress: Please return our husband to us!\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until a reporter saw Lu Lincheng and Liang Yan backstage after an event, where Lu Lincheng took off his jacket and covered Liang Yan, who was wearing a dress, with it and then pressed her on the wall for a kiss, that everyone was forcefully fed a bowl of dog food.>"
