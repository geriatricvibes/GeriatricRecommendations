	"description": "Fang Lin, a dedicated but unprofitable eighteenth-tier star, was reborn.\n\nHe remembered the lessons of his previous life and immediately had a brand new goal in life.\n\n–He didn’t want to work hard anymore.\n\nSeeing all kinds of opportunities slipping away from him, his agent wanted to cry: “Brother, can we fight a little? If this continues, you won’t be able to afford food!”\n\nFang Lin pondered for a moment, “You have a point.”\n\nHis agent was overjoyed.\n\nHe added, “It’s time to find a thigh.”\n\n– If he could, it was better to find the kind of cold boss who only gave money and didn’t talk about feelings.\n\nIn his last life, a certain overlord who barely crossed his path, brushed past him with a cold expression and said, “Follow me.”\n\nThis time, without shame, Fang Lin took the initiative to meet up, and happily signed the owner and salted fish “feeding” agreement.\n\nEach took what they needed, they were both happy.\n\nBoth were adults, both were smart and knew how to find a perfect optimal solution from this relationship.\n\nSo they didn’t know when, both of them also found out that something was wrong early.>"
