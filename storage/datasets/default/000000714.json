	"description": "The Orc Queen O’Luna is furious. She just received a report that one more Orc Fortress has fallen by the hands of the hateful reincarnaters.\n\n“Damn those reincarnateds! Always making a mess in the world that’s not even theirs! I will kill them all!”\n\n[Hee, you will kill me too then?] A voice answered her from the corner of the room\n\n“Of course not! Motoki might be reincarnated but you are my best friend!”\n\n[Cool]\n“But the reincarnaters are so strong, we Orcs can’t kill them… I know! Motoki, can you help kill them for me?”\n\n[Okay, but there’s a condition. You will let me have a way with you then]\n“O….okay. But how will you kill them?”\n\n[Easy Peasy~ I’ll just have to steal their harem and they will weaken and lose their will to fight… then I’ll kill them]\nThus Katou Motoki departed the Orc Castle, deceiving a High Noble Orc’s daughter Ka’Liu and taking her with him as companion on the journey to kill reincarnaters.\n\n[Let’s see, the first target is… Elemental Master Yuutarou]>"
