	"description": "As Heaven’s daughter, she owns and personally runs a magical shop. \r\n\r\nThis shop can leap through time and space and traverse many worlds. In the darkness of night, a glazed dragon-phoenix lamp will guide the fated ones to this shop called the OmniStore, and at this shop, the fated ones will have their wishes granted, but of course, not without a price. \r\n\r\nThe premise is, only if you can afford to pay the price. \r\n\r\nYou, do you want to enter this shop? \r\n\r\nAny wish you have can be fulfilled, yeah! You can be the mightiest one on the entire universe, you can look askance at the world beneath your feet, you can be so superior that you rise beyond and dominate all life! \r\n\r\nHer adorable pets, a dragon and a phoenix, have said. “Our shop is really not a rip-off. We are not just showing off to impress or be superior to others, neither are we putting up a show of hypocrisy. We are just here to put the worlds that have deviated off course back on track.” \r\n\r\nHowever, such an intangible form of boasting is, in fact, the deadliest. \r\n\r\nDear guest, do you need us to gain superiority? Do you need us to help you fly and soar?>"
