	"description": "“Mother, why can you be the only one that can pick my guests?”\n\n“Because only mother knows who is definitely not your father.”\n\nFeng’er, like her mother, is a prostitute in the Butterfly Garden, the leading brothel in Longzhou, the capital of the Dayue Kingdom. The place where she lives, and openly and honestly worked hard to become a qualified courtesan, until her mother told her she is the daughter of the last spymaster.\n\n***********\n\nThe people of Butterfly Garden sold their beauty to receive patrons, so even if love blossomed, there was nowhere to put it in this kind of place nor could they give it.\n\n(Beauty (色): This pertains not just to appearance, but more to s*x appeal that alludes to sex.)\n\nHow will Feng’er and her men rise and fall in their passion for vengeance against the nation— a Kingdom boiling with undercurrents that were merely hidden under the guise of prosperity?\n\n(Rise and fall in passion (浮沉): This indicates another meaning, the up and down body movement during interc**rse.)>"
