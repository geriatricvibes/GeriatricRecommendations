	"description": "I died for some reason and was reborn as the princess of a kingdom. Father is a man who loves his daughter dearly and Mother is kind as long as you don’t anger her. There's also the noisy maid who cares for me very much and a black-hearted siscon brother. I have no memories, but I might be able to spend my new life happily… if only the other countries stopped invading us, that is!\n\nI shall recreate many magical tools in this world based on my remaining knowledge from my past life and defeat foreign enemies. I shall force the troublesome socializing to my older brother and live the leisure life of a princess! \n\nI’m going to survive the chaotic times and create the strongest nation in the world with the occasional cases of kidnapping and adventurer activities!>"
