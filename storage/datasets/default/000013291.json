	"description": "Xia Ming, a university student who just graduated, accidentally got hold of a system. Xia Ming became powerful! Medical skills? OK, I don’t have the skills. But on the following day, even the highly skilled doctors couldn’t be compared to him.\r\n\r\nForce? OK, I’m not your match today but on the following day, even the Great Master would have to concede defeat.\r\n\r\nBasketball? OK, I’m a fusion of the world, the strongest basketball star, would I be afraid of you?\r\n\r\nWife, that is even better. I have a beautiful President Lin, and a Missy who is like a rose. Each of them is beautiful, how are you going to compare to me? … … You guys spent a hard time learning skills, acting but I am different.\r\n\r\nI have an Almighty System, what skills do I not have? As long as I’m willing, even the celestial beings cannot stop me. With Xia Ming’s words: “As long as the system is in my hands, the whole world is under my control.” I am Xia Ming, I speak for myself.>"
