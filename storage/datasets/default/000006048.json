Before her consciousness dissipated, Mo Xiaoyao grabbed one of them and got into the dungeon.\n\nWhen she arrived at her destination after a thousand hardships, what appeared in front of her was a huge cruise ship.\n\nUnder the gangway, the man in the shipmate’s uniform bowed to her: “Ma’am, are you getting on board?”\n\nMo Xiaoyao looked at his octopus-like face with a calm expression: “Of course.”\n\n—\n\n    One day in 24-year-old Mo Xiaoyao’s natal year*, the earth suddenly exploded. She thought she was going to die, but after touching the magic fragment, she entered the dungeon world and began her cruise journey. The racetrack in the mist, the weird circus, the seemingly casual but murderous hot spring town, the tragic team battles where human beings have to kill each other… The only goal of struggling to survive was to reach end point of the cruise ship alive with her companions – to Paradise.\n\n*natal year in Chinese zodiac is a year where a person’s age equal to a multiple of 12.>"
