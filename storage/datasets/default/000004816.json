	"description": "She has stunning looks and talents that are even more amazing, but she hides both deeply because she understands that beauty is never a blessing. One who is beautiful can only bring trouble, especially within such a society where evil runs amok. In addition, one who is too crafty is disliked.\r\n\r\nSo to the common eye, she is an ugly woman, so ugly even ghosts would be too afraid to look at her, a weak, ignorant lady.\r\n\r\nAn imperial edict forces her to marry the well-renowned prime minister of Dong Ling. She cleverly deals with her situation as she faces hidden and openly disdainful looks, smiling coldly and looking on indifferently. She did not want any of this. Why do women make things harder for other women?\r\n\r\nShe is the ugly, cowardly, useless, frail Lady Zi Yinye. But she is actually the handsome and brilliant prime minister Ye Yin!!>"
