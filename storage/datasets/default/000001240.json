	"description": "Duan Shun Jie was no more than a skilled usable valuable piece of pawn. Letting him stay by his side, inevitably there would be a day to put him to good use.\n\nHowever, even Xuan Yuan Xi Cheng himself couldn’t comprehend, why Duan Shun Jie would rather shoulder the bad reputation of betraying his country, would rather endure the all and various kind of malice imposing on his body, but still insisted in staying by his side.\n\nConvinced himself that this was merely an act in a play, he used the more and more crueler  way to attack Duan Shun Jie’s heart.\n\nWhy didn’t he withdraw?
