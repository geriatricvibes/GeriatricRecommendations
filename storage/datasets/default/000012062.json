	"description": "The six-year-old princess Claudia remembered everything that day.\r\n\r\nShe was a legendary magician in her previous life, accompanied by many magicians, but in this world she was kicked out by her stepmother, treated coldly and exploited...\r\n\r\n'I only do what I want.If you're in the way, you have to 'clean up.'\r\n\r\nClaudia has begun to live a life of ease with her magical powers that once shook the world.\r\nTogether with Noah, a handsome boy but blunt black-haired servant, he changes the living environment with a high degree of magic.\r\n\r\n'I apologize, so come back to the royal capital? Do you want me to give you the right to succeed to the throne? I'm not interested in it at all because I can have as much luxury as I want with my magic.'Fluffy, mumbling...\r\n'Hey, why do you go out of your way to sleep on my lap every time?'\r\n\r\nClaudia, sleepy by the magic reaction, was hugged by a reluctant servant and breathed in her sleep again today.>"
