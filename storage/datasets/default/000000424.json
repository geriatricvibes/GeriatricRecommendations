	"description": "The psychedelic forest was encompassed in a thick cloud of fog, barring the vision of everyone, while behind those thick fog ruled chaos, as countless ferocious creatures fought valiantly.\nSome distance away, under a muddy patch of grass, a unique little creature stuck her head out from the dark insect egg.\n“Oh, what the hell is this?”\n‘Why am I born among this terrifying pile of insects?’\nThe area was densely packed with eggs. Occasionally, one or two fat insects would crawl out from them. They looked scary and hideous.\n“I think I was playing a game a few moments ago, right? Why did I appear in such a place and become a monster girl?”>"
