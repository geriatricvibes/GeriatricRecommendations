	"description": "Traveling to the world of one piece, El found that he had become a baby, and there was no such thing as Golden Finger.\n\nBut when he grew up, he found that he didn’t need Golden Finger at all, because his own body was his Golden Finger.\n\nAs soon as he was born, he awakened Observation Haki.\n\nAt the age of three, he can practice swordsmanship, and at the age of five, he can listen to the voice of all things.\n\nIf Charlotte Linlin is a “natural destroyer”, then El is a “natural swordsman”.>"
