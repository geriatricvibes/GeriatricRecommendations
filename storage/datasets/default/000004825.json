	"description": "The city is destroyed. Her family is dead. Her friend was killed right before her eyes. Veronica tried to run away but to no avail. The moment her eyes met ‘it’, her life was turned upside down.\n\n“She’s already been assimilated.”\n\nThe man, holding her hair roughly, looked at her struggling with disgust, and asked her in a quiet steely voice.\n\n“Do you want to live?”\n\n“Kh, uh.”\n\n“Do you want to live even if you roll in hellfire?”\n\n“Let me go.”\n\n“Answer me. If you wish to die, I will kill you without pain.”\n\nShe doesn’t want to die. She doesn’t want to. She’s just been reborn.\n\n“Then ask me for help,” the man, who seemed to read her heart, said softly. The burning abyss was looking straight at her.\n\n“I want to live… please, help me.”\n\nShe didn’t know until then. That his breath and his saliva, filled with his holy power, will save her.\n\nInstead of a lost God, she became a God.>"
