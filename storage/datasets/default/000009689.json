Even before he could mourn his own death, he found himself living the life of a small artist inside the world of a book. \n\nTransmigration? Well, life be like that.\n\nBut why did he have to suffer from terminal cancer, facing a life and death crisis with just a few more months left to live, right after he crossed over?\n\nNevermind, at least he had the food system that allowed him to exchange for his life value by making others experience the pleasure of indulging in delicacies…….\n\nAnd that was how Lin Jianghe embarked on a path of no return to persuade people to grow fat. Sigh, life really had become more and more colorful….>"
