	"description": "In a tragic novel, I possessed the body of Astelle Heines, who died while grooming her husband, 13 years younger than her, to her own taste.\n\nThe ugly lady of Heines.\n\nA noble lady who played house with a child because she had no other man to marry.\n\nThat was Astelle’s reputation within high society.\n\nBut they didn’t know—\n\nWhy Astelle’s heart would ache every time she saw Bleon and the reason why Bleon was so racked with anxiety at the thought of Astelle leaving.\n\nAfter I became Astelle, I experienced true love like never before.\n\n“Please don’t leave me… I cannot live without my wife.”\n\nI will make you happy. So don’t leave me.\n\n“Then, please don’t throw me away even if I’m worse than garbage… please…”\n\nI love you. You were the only light in my exhausting and miserable life.\n\nBleon, it seems like we’re walking side by side in an unreachable parallel world.\n\nSo you can go find your place now.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nGoodbye, Bleon.>"
