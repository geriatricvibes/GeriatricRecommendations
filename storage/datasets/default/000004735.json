	"description": "Jing Ci: Math problems are not easy to do, and aren’t exams not fun? So why not fall in love?\n\nNo interest, impossible, time-consuming. \n\nThe school bully’s arrogant words—-\n\n“Go bother someone else if you want to talk about love. I’m not interested.”\n\n“Just kidding, what kind of thing is Jing Ci? You think dad will look at him more?” \n\nLater–\n\n“You see the one that scored first place in the exam? That’s my boyfriend.” \n\n“Come on, Jing Ci, which one do you choose? Mathematics or me.”\n\nLater–\n\nThe school bully pressed Jing Ci against the wall: “Good, say something nice, and I will let you go.”>"
