	"description": "Yuto has been an adventurer for 10 years.  10. Long. Years.  He put in the work, the effort, the sweat, and blood, but Yuto is different.  He is the only adventurer to never have leveled up once or hasn’t  acquired any skills.  Yuto finds himself facing a monster way out of his league, gets crushed, and wakes up.  It was from that day when his life begins to change.>"
