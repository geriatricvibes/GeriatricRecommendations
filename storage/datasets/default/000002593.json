	"description": "I was supposed to go to defeat the demon lord as a saint, but suddenly I was betrayed by a junior saint apprentice and the hero who was my fiancÃ©.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of death, I regained the memories of my previous life as a Japanese high school girl, but that was all. I was eaten alive by a flower monster without awakening any cheat abilities whatsoever in the end.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back to my sense, I found myself have been reincarnated as a plant monster, Alraune. The upper half of my body that grows out of the flower crown is that of a human girl, but the lower half is that of a plant.\r\n\r\nI want to take revenge on those who have betrayed me, but I can't even move because my roots are buried in the ground. If humans find me, I'll be exterminated as a monster, and as a former saint, I don't want anyone to know that I've become a monster.\r\n\r\nI will just live my new life quietly as a plant while photosynthesizing, so please be kind and water me.>"
