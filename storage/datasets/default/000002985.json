	"description": "This story started in a typical way: love at first sight.\n\nTwo ancient spirits believed each other to be mortal. After dating, going steady, and seriously committing to one another for 200 years, the fox and the snake were ready to send their lover away, only to realise that they were both spirits.\n\nSnake spirit x Fox spirit, Fu Wangzhi x Xie Changan>"
