	"description": "Ollie, an omega from a low-ranking noble family, due to an unexpected Divine Revelation, was chosen a bride candidate for the emperor.\r\n\r\nThinking of it as troublesome, he did not wish to get married, yet went to the inner palace as his father’s life was at stake.\r\n\r\nObviously, the Emperor did not visit him. Spending a leisurely life with nothing particular to do and nothing to be desired, he one day decided to go for a walk in the garden and met a man there.\r\n\r\nOllie thought he was a curt, expressionless man, but seeing his pure and tender figure, Ollie felt attracted to him.\r\n\r\nThis is the odd love story of the emperor alpha who met Ollie while hiding his identity, and the perfect at housework commoner Ollie.>"
