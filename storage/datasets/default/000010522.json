	"description": "「I’ve been reincarnated as the Piggy Duke?!」\n\nThere is a character from the anime Shuya Marionette. His name is Slow Denning. Third son of the Denning House. The most disliked person in Kurushu Magic Academy. He scoffs at those beneath him, laughs at the protagonist, brags about his pedigree, and is dangerously close to breaking the boundaries of human weight. There is nothing redeemable about him.\n\nHowever, that is only a persona. In truth, Slow Denning is a genius magician with a secret heart of gold, who puts on a show as the villain in order to protect and be with his beloved, a retainer by the name of Charlotte.\n\nUnfortunately for the Piggy Duke, he has a tragic future waiting for him. Banished from his country and living life under constant torment as a magic slave, even his beloved leaves him as she falls to the protagonist’s charms.\n\n「Bad ending? Not a chance!」\n\nWaking up in the body of the Piggy Duke, I will take this character who was number one in the character popularity poll and make him number one in this new life!>"
