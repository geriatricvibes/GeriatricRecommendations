	"description": "When she was in kindergarten, the little boys who liked her were beaten up by her childhood friend. When she grew up, no boy dared to like her anymore. She had to take the initiative and confess to her male god, but was intercepted by him halfway: “Chasing boys is not like that, I’ll teach you!” She believed him foolishly, but under his “guidance”, her male god was getting farther and farther away from her… She was very angry: “How many times has it been? Why can’t you wish me well?! Uhhh…” His lips suddenly became hot, and he bit her directly: “Because, you can only be nice to me. I’m going to destroy your male god and be your man!”\n\nNote: male god: popular handsome guy>"
