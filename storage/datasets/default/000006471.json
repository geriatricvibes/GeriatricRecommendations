	"description": "A boy who kills nightmares and a girl who lives them.\r\n\r\nIn the modern age, communication technology has developed that uses dreams as a medium instead of electrons.\r\nIn the world of “shared dreams,” people are engaged in economic activities even when they are asleep.\r\n\r\nA malignant factor that invades artificial dreams and destroys the mind, “Nightmares (Noise)” ……\r\nThere are those who make a living out of suppressing them with force.\r\nThey were called “tapirs” by the people, who likened them to dream-eating beasts.\r\n\r\nOne day, Touya Rumaki, a high school student who carries out his duties as a “tapir,” finds himself in a situation where he is unable to find a way out. He meets a “witch” in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nThe girl, who called herself “Meia”, stretched out her body, which was not free in any way, to Touya and whispered to him like a spell.\r\n“I’ve been betrayed by everything in this world.\r\n\r\nAnd when the wishes of a boy hunting nightmares and a fragile girl intersect\r\nThe nightmare that has been called a disaster, “The Beast’s Dream,” awakens.\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of a dark battle of science fiction and otherworldly powers that will distort the world!\r\n\r\nWith “Gahou”!>"
