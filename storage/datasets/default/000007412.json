	"description": "Tang Chunming was in front of his father’s grave when he took a nosedive and with a swish found himself in ancient times. A world that only had men and gers but no women. He believed he could live a happy life, however reality made him regretful, because there was a baby in his belly. Was this because he did not honor his promise of having a grandson to his father?>"
