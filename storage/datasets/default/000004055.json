	"description": "Between a relationship with love but without sex and a marriage with sex but without love, which would you choose?\r\n\r\nIn this story, buried deep within the annals of Song Dynasty history, the Emperor’s beloved daughter chose the former.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Censor Sima Guang and the rest, the story’s female lead “doesn’t respect the teachings of her elders and doesn’t know the meaning of virtue. She acts as she pleases, absolutely fearless. She has frequently disobeyed her Royal Father’s orders and disgraced her husband’s family’s ancestors,” while the male lead “doesn’t keep to his station. His sinful crimes have grown as tall as a mountain. He should be publically executed.” Their universally shocking and immoral love is hidden within the criticism of these moral articles.\r\n\r\n“Mistaken meeting,\r\non Taoyuan Road.\r\nA hazy sunset covered thousands of miles.\r\nMy lord is leaving and I can’t make him stay.\r\nUnder the autumn moon, a spring breeze blows.\r\nThe peach blossom petals scatter like red rain.\r\nThe face I long for has disappeared from view.”\r\n\r\n– Collection of Musings, Second Work, Taoyuan, Tang Dynasty – Anonymous>"
