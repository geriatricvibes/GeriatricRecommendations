	"description": "Starting Over originated as a story on 2ch by Fafoo, who later took the pen name Sugaru Miaki. He then rewrote it as a novel.\n\n“It’s been too long since we took the time\nNo-one’s to blame, I know time flies so quickly\nBut when I see you darling\nIt’s like we both are falling in love again\nIt’ll be just like starting over, starting over”\n\n– (Just Like) Starting Over\nJohn Lennon\n\nThis is the story of how upon reaching my twentieth birthday, I was sent back to the age of ten, and lived to be twenty once more.>"
