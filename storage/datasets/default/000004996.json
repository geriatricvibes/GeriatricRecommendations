He just came here to find a wife who is warm in bed…\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA few months later:\r\n\r\nWu Qingyuan: Matchmaker, help me arrange a marriage.\r\n\r\nMatchmaker: Who is it?\r\n\r\nWu Qingyuan: Lin Shugen’s family.\r\n\r\nMatchmaker: What? It’s the one who is so ugly and that he doesn’t know how to properly act and still can’t get married…Lin Amo? ! !\r\n\r\nWu Qingyuan: Yes, I like him. (Smiles and blush)\r\n\r\nMatchmaker: ……\r\n>"
