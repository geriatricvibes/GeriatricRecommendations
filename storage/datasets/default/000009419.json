	"description": "I was reincarnated as the protagonist of the Japanese gal game (male version of otome game) “The Jewel of Utopia “, but I didn’t like the characters that could be captured, and when I didn’t raise my affection points, an event of condemnation occurred!\n\nThe one who saved the protagonist from this predicament is the princess of the Sacrifice Empire, who never appeared in the game. \n\nThis is a story about an “overly handsome, high-spec princess” and a “maidenly male protagonist with a high level of feminine power” who love each other dearly.>"
