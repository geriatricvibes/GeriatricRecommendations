	"description": "The almighty Skinia Empire invaded the Principality of Arita, taking it under its dominion. The imperial educational system enforced on the children of the fallen aristocracy is to “pair with a partner decided by the Empire and concieve a child in the spring of their 18th year.”\n\nThe Count’s daughter, Tiana, is to be paired with Adele, the Elite knight she quarrels with since childhood. Their first night passes without romance while the two exchange verbal blows.\n\nTiana thought that it would be only for one night, but Adele calls for her many times after, in the name of their duty?!>"
