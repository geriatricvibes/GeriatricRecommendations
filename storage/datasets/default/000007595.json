	"description": "You always said that youth would never last forever, and the us of that time-- was the best of us.\n\nThis time, we will bid farewell to our whole youth.\n\nDo you still remember your high school deskmate? That boy with the world’s brightest smile, that girl with the world’s most beautiful silhouette?\n\nIn the three years of high school, the shadows of two people intertwine with the chalk, black and white both distinct, drifting around within the memories.\n\nWith You paints a reminiscence of the story of the female lead, Geng Geng, and the male lead, Yu Huai, during their three years as deskmates. Taking troubles to heart,* the small moments of their growth throughout the entire story touch the heart and bring nostalgia and memories to their peak.\n\n*(Geng Geng Yu Huai, put together, form a homonym of the idiom 'to take troubles to heart.')>"
