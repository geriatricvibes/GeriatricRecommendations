	"description": "I transmigrated as the villainess of a novel. \n\nSo what if I’m a villainess? As the daughter of a Duke, I am rich and unemployed! I’ll simply live a leisurely life… or at least, that was what I thought until I witnessed my fiancé, the Crown Prince, having an affair right in front of me. \n\nI used to shed tears when I saw him laugh with another woman in his arms, but now, I did not reveal my emotions.\n\nInstead, I asked him a question with a bright and happy expression on my face, “Are you a son of a b*tch?”\n\nShe was dropped in the world of a novel and planned on overthrowing the original novel’s plot!>"
