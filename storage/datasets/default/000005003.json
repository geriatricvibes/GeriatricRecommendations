	"description": "“When I tell you to do A, you can’t just ignore it and do B,” the Prince said.\n\n“Sure,” she replied. She’ll just do C, then! No biggie.\n\n“If I tell you to go east, you can’t ignore me and go west,” the Prince added.\n\n“Yes,” she nodded. If she can’t go west, north or south works fine too.\n\n“You are NOT allowed to have an affair with any other men!” the Prince emphasized.\n\n“Obviously,” she said. Why would she have an affair with others when they could just have it with her?\n\nQu Tan'er has transmigrated into the body of a noble young lady and forced to marry the ice-cold 8th prince. Her only care in this world is finding a way to get back to her original body and dealing with all the politics and intrigue surrounding the marriage is just a distraction. \n\nLord, don't let our marriage be a bother. Just give me a divorce!>"
