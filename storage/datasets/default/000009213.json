	"description": "Six years ago, in order to repay his lover’s debt, Wang YinCheng gave birth to a child through surrogacy.\n\nSix years later, when he flew to H City alone for work, he accidentally met his former lover at the airport. The man was now not only living a beautiful life, but also had a tall, handsome and rich president boyfriend.\n\nHowever, what Wang YinCheng did not expect was that the six-year-old son of that indifferent president actually resembled him very closely.>"
