	"description": "When Qing Shi Jiu got up, Ling Shan Jun had already left; half of the bed was ice-cold. He curled up around the blanket, took up the entire bed, closed his eyes and continued to sleep. \n\nUntil he was woken up by a person made of clay. \n\nThe rain outside became much smaller, Qing Shi Jiu ate a few bites of food super slowly, and from the headboard took out Ling Shan Jun’s book of travel notes to read. \n\nThe clay children followed close behind and cried out: “Madam has not finished eating.”\n\nQing Shi Jiu did not acknowledge them: “I’m full.”>"
