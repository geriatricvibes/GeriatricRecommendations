	"description": "Serel, a young boy living in the capital, calls himself just a librarian.\r\nHe works at the Royal Magical Library, where he spends his days organizing, reading, and spending time with books.\r\n\r\nAs a librarian, he thinks he's busy, but he's having fun, and he's doing his job just fine, but apparently the people around him think differently.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is abnormal to be the sole librarian of this huge library.\r\nHe has a huge amount of knowledge and is a living textbook.\r\nI'm sure you'll agree with me.\r\n\r\nI've been told that I'm the only court librarian in the capital, and I've been told this by people who have come to the library.\r\n‘I'm just doing my job as normal’, I thought, as I went about my day at the library.>"
