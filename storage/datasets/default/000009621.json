	"description": "Although Ren Yaoqi broke away from the fetters of her family in her previous lifetime, as she erroneously believed in her blood-relatives’ speech and views about sacrificing everything for the family’s interest, it ultimately led to her Elder Sister self-immolating in the army camp, her Mother passing away early with tears in her eyes and her Father dying with his blood splattered under the sword……\n\nWhen she was reborn to her younger times, she swore that she would chop away all the sharp claws which intended to control her own life.\n\nHer father’s concubine who has some sinister motives, the cruel and unscrupulous elders, the aggressive foreign enemies and the surreptitious behaviors of harming people from the secret corners in the court……\n\nShe will expose their painted skins of disguise one by one, and strive for a life of happiness and peace for herself and those she loves.>"
