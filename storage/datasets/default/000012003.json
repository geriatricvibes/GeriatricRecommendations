	"description": "Growing up in a garbage room in a cheap apartment, I tragically died and no living in the world of my favorite anime, “Burnt Hair Melody”\r\nHowever, I was reborn as Alice Lenier, a lady of nobility, whose true character was that of the villainous boss, the ‘Queen’\r\nOnce again, it was a life full of unhappiness since childhood.\r\nI, Alice successfully got promoted in the Evil Organization with a longing desire to attend a night party at the royal palace. Which was the first episode of the animation.\r\nAt the age of 16, I was taken by a good-looking guardian… of course, I’m trying to be invisible as much as possible as the supporting character.\r\nHowever, for some reason, it’s, I, Alice, not the heroine that was invited by the crown prince, male lead, for his first dance\r\n…!?\r\nThis is completely the opposite, but for sure it’ll go back to track later on.>"
