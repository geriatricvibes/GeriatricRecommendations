	"description": "Emperor Alec lost his wife Afrosa.\r\n \r\nHe did not simply punish those responsible for her death, but also went so far as to burn down the castle and kill himself. However, he woke up and found himself in the past. \r\n \r\n“I will change it all one by one.”\r\n \r\nFor your sake.\r\n \r\nBecause God brought me back to life in order to have you once more.\r\n \r\nAlec, who wanted to create a new future where he would not lose his wife and child again. However, his love for them gradually turned into a blind obsession.\r\n \r\n“What’s wrong? Why are you acting like this?”\r\n \r\n“Same for you.”\r\n \r\n“What did I do?”\r\n \r\n“What’s wrong with you too?”\r\n \r\n“…….”\r\n \r\n“You’re mine. Because you’re my wife. If anyone treats you like some b*tch they stole from me, I will rip out their intestines and chew off their bones.”\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, Afrosa constantly felt unfamiliar with her husband’s changed personality.\r\n \r\nUntil one day, she had a strange dream which confused her…\r\n \r\n‘My husband is not the same. If I don’t run away, I will meet the same end as before.’\r\n \r\nThe unfamiliar woman standing next to her husband… Her own shabby silhouette…\r\n \r\nSickened by the vividness of the vision as if it were all reality, she could no longer stand to look at her husband.\r\n \r\nIs this all actually a dream?>"
