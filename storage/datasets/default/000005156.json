	"description": "For an entire decade, Shin Tae Pong had reigned as the number one player in the game, Paradiso, but then he suddenly died of exhaustion.\n\nMysteriously reincarnated into the world of the game as the obese, corrupt and generally unknown noble, Jared Eucalates, he uses what he has learned from playing the game, hoping to prevent the “Great Nasu War” that will take place in five years. Knowing that this war would not spare anyone as insignificant as him, Jared embarks on a journey to prevent this outcome. Armed with his knowledge of the game’s skills, cheats, and bugs, he plans on using everything he has on hand to save himself and the people he has grown to care about, before anyone can rob him of these opportunities!\n\n“Cheats? Bugs? Exploits?! For success, anything goes!”\n\nThe challenges in the life of a super obese lord.>"
