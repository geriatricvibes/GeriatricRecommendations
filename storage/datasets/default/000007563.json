	"description": "A sequel to “The Villainess Wants to Escape.” I’m the fiancée of the Crown Prince, who is a capture target in an otome game that I played in my past life. I was reincarnated as the villainess who harasses the heroine, gets convicted, and dies. But, I don’t want to die so I won’t get involved with the heroine.>"
