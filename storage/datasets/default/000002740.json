	"description": "Suzuki, an adult programmer, suddenly noticed that he was thrown into another world wearing casual clothes at level 1. He gained a high level and many treasures after using the 3-times-use disposable magic, Meteor Shower, once. After that he intends to do another world “sightseeing tour”?\n\nHe meets three beast-kin girls, beautiful purple and black-haired sisters and an eccentric blonde-haired elf girl, along with various people during his trip. Although occasionally fighting demons and demon lords, this is a heartwarming fantasy story at heart>"
