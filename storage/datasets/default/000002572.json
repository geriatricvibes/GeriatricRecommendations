	"description": "Why is that, every time I would try to say my feelings, the train would always stop me?\n\nI thought to myself, would I really let the train stop my feelings?\n\nThat’s why inhaling deeply, with my hands at each side of my mouth, I shouted, “I LIKE YOU!”\n\nBut as I shouted, the door had already closed and the train had already gone off.\n\nNo matter how strong your heartbeat is and even if he’s near, if a train passed by, he won’t hear it.\n\nTrain Guy: “Hi!”\n\nTrain Girl: “Hello!”>"
