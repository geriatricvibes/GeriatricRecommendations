	"description": "Having an outstanding tutor was the bare minimum of a good teaching environment.\r\n\r\nThis was the fundamental reason behind Di Lin choosing Saint Padeus’ Magic Institution.\r\n\r\nBut only after entering the school did he realise—\r\n\r\nHis imagination was too perfect, while reality was too disastrous. Friends were scarce, and the tutor was difficult to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe saying Di Lin passed down to later generations: “My glorious times… started from remaining silent.”>"
