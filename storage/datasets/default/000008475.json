	"description": "Tragically, Shan Ziwei was hit by a car, and when he woke up, two hundred years had passed. Even more tragically, he still had his strange variant of hypersexuality.\n\n“I’m very sorry, but we are unable to cure you.”\n\n“W-wait! Even AIDS can be cured now, how come hypersexuality can’t?”\n\n“Ha… haha…”\n\nThere was no other choice, Shan Ziwei could only return to his old job of being a quiet, peaceful gamer. Though, the games nowadays were a bit… strange…\n\n[System: Dear player, you must stay in character, adhering to what is described in the following scenarios.]\n\nScenario 1: You like to shake hands with strangers.\n\nScenario 2: You like to hug friends.\n\nScenario 3: You’re a bottom.\n\nScenario 4: You’re a bottom.\n\nScenario 5: Important things should be said twice.\n\nShan Ziwei: … How am I meant to play a game like this?! (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻>"
