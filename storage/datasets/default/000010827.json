	"description": "I had been reborn and plunged into a strange world with sultans and harems.\n\nAnd on the contrary, I’m not a human anymore, but a kitten who can’t speak!\n\nThere’s only one way for me to become a human.\n\nAnd that is to kiss a prince who is a qualified sultan.\n\nBy the way…\n\nWhy are all the people in this palace so strange?\n\n* * *\n\nPrince Sulayman, who mistook me for an assassin and treated me with indifference:\n\n“I don’t want to give you to anyone. I will protect you. You… you’re my precious cat.”\n\n…and Prince Theron, who I thought was gentle, spoke to me obsessively:\n\n“Don’t choose my older brother, please choose me. I will give you everything in this kingdom.”\n\nHe whispered such sweet temptations into my ear.\n\nI have to kiss one of them to keep my human form.\n\n“Meow! (My head hurts!) \n\nWhat is my future going to be like?>"
