	"description": "Tang Zhou dreamed that he was cannon fodder in a novel.\n\nBecause of prejudice, he misunderstood and hurt the villain, and later was framed by his illegitimate younger brother and became impoverished.\n\nAfter waking up from his dream, he looked at the innocent and harmless young villain in front of him and decided to change his own ending.\n\n*\n\nFu Shen knew about his background long ago and had been plotting for many years for this reason.\n\nHe agreed to Tang Zhou’s harsh demands, pretended to be harmless, and kept a low profile.\n\nHis original plan was to turn around and leave naturally after the deed was done.\n\nBut unexpectedly, after one night, this person seemed to have changed.\n\nPeeled off the coat of indifference, there was actually a piece of small sugar cake inside.\n\nFu Shen was born with a sweet tooth, and after having a taste, he couldn’t let go.>"
