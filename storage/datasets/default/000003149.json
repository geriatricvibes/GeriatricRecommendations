	"description": "There are so many strange things in this world that make us wonder:\n\nWhy does the lone soul hanging in the cold classroom have a smile at the corner of its mouth? 　　 　　\n\nWhy does the half-broken corpse hidden in the cave of Ghost Valley feel unresigned? 　　 　　\n\nHow can a few puddles of flesh displayed on the lonely rocks of the beach have dreams? 　　 　　\n\nWe saw the caged beast in the villa floor forgetting that he was once a human being. 　　 　　\n\nWe see people in tattoo stores transforming into demons and ghosts and then painting themselves with human skin. 　　\n\nWe saw the couple walking down the aisle with their arms folded. 　　 　　\n\nWe can see the lonely people in the dark mine relying on each other’s warm and decadent bones……… In the end what turned an originally good people into a heartless murderer? 　　 　\n\n　\n\nThirty cases, thirty stories, thirty times the most essential interplay between good and evil. 　　 　　\n\nLet’s see how the reality of heaven becomes the heart of hell, how the angel of mercy becomes the cruel devil ……>"
