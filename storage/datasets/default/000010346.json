	"description": "Shadow Empress Diane is trapped in a tower and draws blood for the Emperor.\r\nThe Shadow Empress, no one can remember, has been treated only as a tool to provide blood.\r\n\r\nEventually she died.\r\n\r\n'You're dead? It's difficult to die. Pull out all the blood.'\r\n\r\nAfter the brutal words, the darkness struck her, and\r\nDiane, who opened her eyes again, escaped the tower for revenge and headed to the forbidden forest of Paquinus to survive.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, the Great Emperor Siher was defeated by the current emperor and was there.\r\nHe was like a giant silver beast!\r\n\r\n'Drink my blood. And contract with me. I'll help you take revenge. '\r\n\r\nDiane, who was trapped in the tower all the time and treated as subhuman, and Siher,\r\nwho was cursed and gave up to be human.\r\nThe fateful encounter between the two changes the future!>"
