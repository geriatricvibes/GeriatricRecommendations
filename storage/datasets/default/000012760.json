	"description": "Yin Yin: the female antagonist of “All for Prosperity”, has all the madness a villainess should have. She takes destroying the relationship between the Male and Female Lead as her own personal responsibility. Her method’s are clumsy and was finally blackmailed by the Male Lead.\n\nLin Xin’er commented: She needs IQ.\n\nSo she was transmigrated.\n\nDu Qianqian: the heroine of “All for Prosperity”, is a white lotus flower whose IQ is more worrying than the villainess. She jumps off a cliff and died under persecution.\n\nLin Xin’er commented: She deserves it.\n\nSo she was reborn.\n\nLin Xin’er: the reader of “All for Prosperity”, is a 21st century leftover woman. Her major hobby in life is cheating people – even making it as her own career. She transmigrated into the novel and became Yin Yin.\n\n—— Life, perhaps, was just a game of chess with exquisite layout. But this time the players have changed.>"
