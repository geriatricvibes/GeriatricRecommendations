I don't want to go out with you, Sato-kun.'\n\nTen years ago, when I was a sophomore in high school, I made the confession of a lifetime. My partner was a girl on a high mountain whom everyone was in love with. The results were disappointing. There was no way that I, an ordinary guy, could have gone out with her. Everyone has a bitter youth. I thought that and forgot about it.\n\n'It's been a while. Kazuki Sato-kun.'\nTen years later, I met her again.\nTen years later, I reunited with my first love, whom I thought I would never meet again.\n\n'Hi, it's been a while. Yuna Shirakawa.'\n\nThe difference between me and her hadn't changed. I work for a black company and she works for a prestigious company. However, it was just a reunion after a long time. I thought we wouldn't get involved any more. \n\n'We lived next door to each other... I wonder if this is fate?' \n\n'Oh, my God. What's with the gloomy look on your face? We're here together! Oh, my God!'\n\n'Nothing good will come from feeling guilty! -This is a chance to reclaim our youth.'\n\nThis is a story about regaining youth once it's over. This is the story of me and my girlfriend, who refused to go out with me that day.>"
