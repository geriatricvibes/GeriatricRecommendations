	"description": "The cousin isn’t called Biao Ge. He has his own name. His name is Cheng Jinyu. From the phrase—– Wo Jin Huai Yu (to hold and cherish a beautiful jade; a person with good moral values), it’s the name his father gave him.\n\nBut Chen Yuze calls him Biao Ge, so Biao Ge became his name.\n\nBiao Ge has a sworn enemy, his name is Gu Bokai. Biao Ge doesn’t know how he provoked this person. He detested himself very much. Like being disgusted with sh*t in a garbage can.\n\nHowever one day Biao Ge was told to marry Gu Bokai. As for the reason, because Biao Ge’s life is hard!\n\nGu Bo Kai has married three times and now has three dead wives…\n\nGu Bo Kai: No, absolutely not!\n\nMother Gu: First cry, second stir up trouble, third hang oneself (throwing a temper tantrum). Continue to get married, or I die and let you see.\n\nGu Bo Kai: Why?\n\nMother Gu: He is tough, can avoid being killed by you and can also have children.\n\n(Shou and Gong have no kinship. Biao Ge is what others call this person. It’s like a name)>"
