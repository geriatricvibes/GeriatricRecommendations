	"description": "Due to an accident, half of Kagami Keinaâ€™s body was paralyzed. One day, because of a power outage she regrettably died, but just before that she was moved to the world of the online game she was playing. When woke up, she was in the game, moreover it was 200 years in the future?\r\n\r\nWell for the time being, in order to survive I should probably do something.\r\n\r\nIn the world that was a video game, who stands in the way of the fumbling girl making her way through!?>"
