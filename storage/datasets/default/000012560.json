	"description": "That girl departed from this world when she was still young. About one year after her death, she was reborn as a different person with her memories intact. She lived her second life in a different city, with a different family, a different body, and with a new name.\n\nShe had been leading an uneventful life, until one day, she had to move out of town due to her mother’s work circumstances. That is, to the nostalgic town where [the girl before she was reborn] had once lived.\n\nShe returned to the town where she had lost everything, and she encountered a young lady whose face resembled that of her special one.>"
