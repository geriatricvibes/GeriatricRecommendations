	"description": "Traveling to the World Dominated by Gods.\r\n\r\nLin Yan found himself crossing into a wildfire which was about to go out in the wasteland!\r\n\r\nHe thought the Hell Mode was turned on, but the System was activated at a critical time!\r\n\r\nAs long as He burned everything, He can easily obtain energy points, evolution points, and get unlimited evolution!\r\n\r\nLin Yan: 'What about crossing into flames? Flames can also start a prairie fire! Flames can also burn gods!'\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nSome people call it ' Flame of the sky,' which can burn through the sky, and even the sun, moon and stars in the sky are burned to ashes!\r\n\r\nSome people call it 'Flame of extinguishing the World'. Once it becomes powerful, the fire burns even the Gods!\r\n\r\nSome people call it ' Lord of Flames', repaying the most pious belief, trembling at the sight, and maintaining awe even when dreaming!\r\n\r\nFrom wildfire to the Flame God who dominates the Gods, the Flame of Lin Yan, make all the Gods tremble!>"
