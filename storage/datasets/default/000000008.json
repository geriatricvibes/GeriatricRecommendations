	"description": "Why did this happen? ＼(^o^)／\r\n\r\nOne morning, as I woke up, I recalled the memories of my past life as if it was natural, just like the forthcoming of dusk and dawn. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe world I live in now is very similar to those in fantasy adventure games I played in my previous life, and when I found out that I was actually a villainous character doomed by the protagonist, I tried to live a modest but vigorous life so that I could avoid my fated end. Yet, somehow, I ended up having the strongest female slave unit, which could probably dominate the world without me lifting a finger.>"
