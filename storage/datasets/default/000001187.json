	"description": "In a romance novel called “The Secret Lovers of the Academy” the male lead would often torment his fiancée–but wait, why did she cross into this world to become his fiancée, the villainess, instead of the heroine? \n\nLouise Sweeney found the perfect solution to escape the misfortune of being the villainess: “Your Highness, I just want to tell you that we don’t have to be tied with our engagement. We weren’t even officially engaged, right?” \n\nBut what was wrong with the male lead’s reaction? To her suggestion, he replied “But our engagement wasn’t false, don’t you agree?”>"
