	"description": "I possessed the body of a desert fox werebeast’s villainess youngest daughter.\n\nI was born with a diamond spoon in my mouth, despite the fact that they are a villainous family. I really hope that this time I could live happily with my handsome father and brothers.\n\nHowever, according to the original story, our family was to be annihilated because the s*ave I’ve been raising since the age of three is the ultimate villain…\n\n“What were you thinking when you treated Rory that way? Did Rory made a mistake?”\n\n“Rory? You’re talking about that s*ave?”\n\nHearing her naive brother’s words, she grimaced and shook her head.\n\n“Merchen, my dear sister, please don’t tell me you’re trying to be friends with that s*ave. A noble cannot befriend a s*ave!”\n\nHey, my ignorant brother, the s*ave you’re referring to will be the ultimate villain! But is this the only way to change the future and survive?\n\nCan I raise this villain well?>"
