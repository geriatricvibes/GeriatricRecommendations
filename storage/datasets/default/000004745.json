	"description": "After eight years, Duke Erte returned to his homeland as a hero.\n\nHe returned with glory and honor, but all he truly wanted was revenge. Revenge for the wife that no one remembers. “Rise”, who threw down her life to protect him right until the very end.\n\n“Will you help me?”\n\nAnd for the sake of his revenge, he needed a woman. A woman to prove his status as an of age ‘adult’ so that he could trample upon the pride of those stuck-up nobles.\n\nIn that way, this woman was a good fit.\n\n“Be my woman.”\n\nShe was a refugee who had lost her home, working to raise her daughter alone.\n\nThe only thing about her that resembled his wife was her name, “Rise”.\n\nBut the longer he spent with her, the more the young Duke began to realize something. Their resemblance didn’t end with just their name.\n\nThat was when he thought of one possibility, one that he had been denying this entire time.\n\nShe might actually be his wife.>"
