	"description": "For 20 years I took care of my mother, who had dementia.\r\nBut instead of appreciative gazes, I received cold gazes and contempt from my family instead.\r\n\r\nBut then a miracle happened to me.\r\n\r\n“I am . . . young again?”\r\n\r\nUnbelievably, my body has turned back to how I had looked in my early 20s.\r\n\r\nBut from that day on, something strange has also been happening.\r\nI keep hearing grotesque sounds, and monsters keep coming at me.\r\n\r\nIt’s nice to have my youth back again, but. . .\r\nit seems that my youth is not the only thing that I’ve got.>"
