Who knew that on the first day of this job, he would encounter Yao Yao.\r\n\r\nThe first time Yao Yao met him, he didn’t even know how to kiss! But later on, he became naughty. Even when he had Yao Yao’s heart in the palm of his hand, he didn’t admit that he liked her!\r\n\r\nYao Yao got angry and threw him far far away. If you won’t admit you like me, then don’t even think about coming back!\r\n\r\nWho knew that the golden retriever of the past would suddenly grow a wolf’s tail.
