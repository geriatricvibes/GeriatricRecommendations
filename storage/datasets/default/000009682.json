	"description": "The Demon King, Juno, was sealed in the holy space by the goddesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the three hundred years that he was sealed away for, he managed to create the strongest magic, 『Magic Tuning』.\r\n\r\nThe spell grants him the ability to interfere with his opponent’s magic circuit, while giving them pleasure and making them climax. Once the spell is activated, it would let him toy with his opponents to his heart’s desire!\r\n\r\nHe will first make an example of the sword princess who tried to subjugate him, Spica, by making her fall from pleasure!!>"
