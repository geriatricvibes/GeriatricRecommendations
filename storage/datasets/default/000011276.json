	"description": "It was a hero with dreams of unifying the continent that saved me, who was about to become an offering made to a monster.\n\nAnd inevitably, I fell in love with him.\n\nBut, the sad truth is, every famed and mythical hero eventually ends up with a beautiful and noble princess. And I was just a girl he’d saved.\n\nSo, when he finally did unify the continent and marry a princess like any other hero,\n\nI, who couldn’t bring myself to kill you, decided to leave forever.\n\n“Goodbye, my moonlight.”>"
