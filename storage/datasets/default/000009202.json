Leave it to me. The army’s airplanes and cannons can’t be used? Leave it to me! Aircraft carriers, spaceships? No problem!\n\nThe world: This MC is so wishy-washy! He even wants to sympathize with a monster; is he the holy father?\n\nXiao Mo: There are treasures everywhere you see in the apocalypse; just pick anything up, bring it home to restore, and it will be as good as new ^^\n\nHence, Xiao Mo that worked as the boss of the recycling shop became rich in the apocalypse… pui!\n\nBefore this, he still has a very big problem to solve: If he doesn’t complete the mission, what should he do when he gets killed by the system?\n\nXue Li Hong: Boss, why don’t you hire me. A mission a night; once the mission level rises, the number of times increases.>"
