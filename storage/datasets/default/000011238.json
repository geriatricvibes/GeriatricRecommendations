	"description": "In that world, there was a peaceful little house surrounded by a sky filled with slightly snow-white stars. There was a kind old granny, a lonely but warm and gentle young man, and a talking black cat. A heart-thumping journey of the soul, and a world filled with death and wonder. She had went to that world, and he had existed in that world.>"
