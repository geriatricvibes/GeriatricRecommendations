	"description": "One day, Kousaka Mizuki suddenly experienced an other world trip. She was an otaku, therefore, she quickly adapted to it. She decided to live her life as a sorcerer since she had no other choice.\n\nShe lived in this other world freely using the automatic language translation bestowed onto her, and knowledge from her original world. However, reality was quite harsh.\n\nShe fully came to realize how she should treat these beautiful guys, destroying a maiden’s dream with their quirks.\n\n“I definitely won’t raise a love flag…!”\n\n…The country protecting her was a country where ability was supreme — extraordinary (aka genius) + peerless beauty -> there would be a great downside to them.\n\nThis is the story of a woman who died, arrived in a different world without any role, and removed obstacles while fully utilizing all of the knowledge she’d gained up until then.>"
