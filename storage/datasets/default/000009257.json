	"description": "Ye Feng feels that he is very humble, knowing that the other party does not like men, he still can’t restrain the desire of the flesh, seize the opportunity to seduce the drunken subordinates, take the initiative to open his thighs, indulge himself in surrendering to men. Under the crotch, let a man ride on him, gallop freely, and water him.\n\n    He secretly  loves the sunshine that does not belong to him, and hides all his love in the excuse of “drinking chaos”, maintaining the most normal relationship between the upper and lower sides. However, he tried to put aside the physical relationship between the two but attracted the other’s attention.>"
