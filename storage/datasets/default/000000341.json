	"description": "Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils by Jin Yong was first serialized in newspapers from 3 September 1963 to 27 May 1966.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the journeys of three protagonists. The main thematic element of the novel concerns the complex, troubled relationships between characters from various kingdoms and sects, and the inherent bond that underlies the struggles of each. The novel examines the cause and effect that forms and breaks these bonds on five uniquely corresponding levels: self, family, society, ethnic group, and country.>"
