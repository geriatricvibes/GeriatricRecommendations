To use a particular technique to turn humans into vampires, and to take the identity of a Sire to be responsible to the newly-turned.\n\nIn modern society, this kind of ancient art has been lost. As the last descendant, Xia Yuzhou was forced to become a Dad to all kinds of people.\n\nMiddle-aged rich person: “Who are you?”\n\nGenius young man: “Are you immortal?”\n\nBeautiful young girl: “You turned me into a vampire. Are you planning on taking me to your castle full of blood-red roses, and to imprison me there for eternity?”\n\nXia Yuzhou: “I’ll answer everyone once, I am your “Daddy”. I’m not immortal, I don’t have a castle, just a dental clinic, and every month I will give you all a thousand Yuan in pocket money.”>"
