	"description": "In his previous life, Song Song was a pitiful man. Someone killed him, took his identity and his child, and became the first male empress in history. \n\nLi Xiao in his previous life was even more pitiful. Driven insane by poison, he lost control and killed countless people and just happened to miss the only person who could have cured him in that lifetime. \n\nAfter rebirth, Song Song knew that he could be Li Xiao’s remedy. He also knew that Li Xiao could be his strongest supporter. In order to regain their baby who also died in their past life, he decided to take the initiative this time– Only to find that Li Xiao was even more enthusiastic! >"
