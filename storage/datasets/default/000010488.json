	"description": "I was covered with cuts and bruises all over me as I passed through the thorns and thistles, \r\n\r\nand at the end, I was able to find a rose at the back of a sharp thorn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at me as I considered a rose as my faith, \r\n\r\nyet they didn't know that the thorns on the rose once broke me out from the dark. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na novelist (shou) and a singer (gong), \r\n\r\n18 years old, Yu Qiu displayed his talent to the writing industry for the first time. \r\n\r\n22 years old, Yu Qiu who was extremely influential, was crowned as a plagiarist. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'They called you filthy and unpleasant. Yet whenever I look at you, I only see the moonlight.' >"
