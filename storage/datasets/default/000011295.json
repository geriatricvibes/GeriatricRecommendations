	"description": "Along with his friend, he transmigrated as a person in the martial arts novel Moorim Story. The problem is,\n\n“What is the old file room? Is it like multi-day work?”\n\n“What is the North Sea Ice Palace? Is it something like the Northern Daiko?”\n\nMy friend is a BL fan,while I’m a romance fantasy fan.\n\n“It’s weird, but don’t men watch martial arts a lot? Even if I do, why don’t you know martial arts?”\n\n“I liked romance fights more than sword fights since I was young.”\n\nMy name here is Ha Myo-Ha. I don’t know any martial arts, but I can’t run away when I’ve already transmigrated. Fortunately, I’ve been reading a lot of romance fantasies. The more you try to stay away from the main character, the more you get entangled! \n\nI get closer and closer to the main character ‘Yoo Seol-Hwa’ on purpose. Besides, I’m a  big fan of pretty people myself.\n\nCountless beauties and handsome men appear one by one. The martial arts world view is quite a place to live!>"
