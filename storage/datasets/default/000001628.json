	"description": "Marquess Rebecca Howard remembered her previous life on the day before the graduation ceremony of the Royal Remus Academy.\n\nApparently, this is an otome game (supposedly in a magical world) where the heroine is Baroness Charlotte Silva, a candidate for the saint, and Rebecca is a villainess who stands in her way.\n\nWhen Rebecca realizes she’s been reincarnated into another world, she takes advantage of the condemnation event and manages to break off her engagement to His Highness Prince Garrett.\n\nHer goal is to return to her domain and live a comfortable single life, because she still loves her husband from her previous life… but things take an unexpected turn!　\n\nThere are some events that are typical of an otome game, but the outcome takes a turn for the worse, so please be careful if you are expecting a classic story.>"
