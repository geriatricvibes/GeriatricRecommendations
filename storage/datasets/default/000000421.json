He was born into an aristocratic family, and although he comes from a family of swordsmen, he is banished from his family because he has no talent with the sword. However, Sam has a rare talent as a wizard in this world!\n\n‘If I can’t use a sword, I’ll use magic to become the strongest in the world!’\n\nOn his way, he has a fateful encounter with the self-proclaimed “Genius Wizard” Ur Scheidt.\n\nUr notices the magical talent that lies dormant within Sam and takes him as her disciple, saying ’I’ll train you.’ Sam and Ur lead a harsh but fun life, but one day their adventures come to an abrupt end…?!>"
