	"description": "When rain falls while the sun is shining, a fox wedding is being held.\r\n\r\nA city girl returns to her hometown. There is such a folklore in her hometown:\r\n\r\nLegend has it that there is a fox in the mountain. The fox has a cave full of treasures, which is reserved as betrothal gifts for his bride.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition in the village that every time the villagers get married, the bride will sing a folk song to the fox in a wedding dress. The fox will then bless her with a happy marriage. If she sings well, the fox will also send her a betrothal gift. At night, he would walk on the dew-dusted path to marry her.>"
