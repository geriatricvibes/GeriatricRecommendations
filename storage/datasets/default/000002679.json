It’s all on his mother for not teaching him well.\n\nSon’s debt and mother’s repayment, love debt and repayment. It’s absolutely fair and reasonable.\n\n“On the Best Way to Punish the Unfaithful Ex”\n\n——It doesn’t matter if others dump me, I’ll just go to his old mother.\n\nThe affectionate collision between the enchanting and courageous youth and the old-fashioned abstinent professor.>"
