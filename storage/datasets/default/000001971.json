	"description": "A spin-off of Lillia and Treize, Meg and Seron is a high school adventure/mystery/romance/comedy of sorts taking place in the rough equivalent of the 1950s. The story follows Seron, a stoic and handsome bookworm who is in love with his classmate--a sweet, oblivious transfer student named Meg.\r\n\r\nMeg and Seron takes place at around the same time as Lillia and Treize, but knowledge of the main series is not necessary to read Meg and Seron.>"
