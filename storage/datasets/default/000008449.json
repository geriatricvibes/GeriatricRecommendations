	"description": "A high school student suddenly finds herself with a condition by the name of ‘Absolute Order’ where she is forced to listen to the voice in her head.\n\nIt is a voice that attacks regardless of one’s will, rendering them unable to disobey its orders.\n\nHowever, it is a voice that cannot be heard by others, a voice that only oneself can hear.\n\nWhat is the difference between that and one’s own will?\n\nIf they think that they dislike it, that is merely because such a thing is shameful.\n\nIn the depths of their heart, they seek that voice.\n\nThe voice that pulls out one’s real intentions is not a sickness, but one’s own heart.\n\nA voice that makes one honest to one’s heart. Is it good? Or is it bad?\n\nThe one who thinks of the path of pleasure is oneself. The one who thinks of the path of shame is also oneself.\n\nAfter all, the only one to decide one’s path is oneself.>"
