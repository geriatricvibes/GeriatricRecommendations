	"description": "Xiao Yi Qing and Shu Jing Rong were both extraordinary. As the blood-soaked years passed, they fought to conquer the pugilist world. But, their pasts persuaded each that ruthlessness was the only way to survive. \n\nThey could convince others to bow to them, but could not help the love, hate, and suspicion in their hearts. \n\nPerhaps they would only be able to let down their guard when their weapons met for the last time.>"
