	"description": "I had a strange dream.\r\n\r\nA dream where someone with the same face as me said, “I don’t want to be the wife of a beast even if I die. So exchange your life with me.”\r\n\r\nAfter that, I woke up in a room belonging to a large mansion that I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, there are many animals walking around everywhere.\r\n\r\nTigers, rabbits, dogs, raccoons, animals with names I don’t understand.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand their language either.\r\n\r\nAnd the lion, who seems to be the owner of the mansion, is somewhat intimidating.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful story of a young man who after living a gloomy and lonely life due to his quiet personality, begins to live a warm and fluffy life in a whole new world.>"
