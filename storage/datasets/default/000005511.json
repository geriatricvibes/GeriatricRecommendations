	"description": "Zheng Xiaoguang always thought that she was freaking awesome in terms of playing games. Although she was not an RMB fighter, her big brother could protect her. As such, Zheng Xiaoguang always felt great during a mission.\r\nUnfortunately, her superiority ended until last week.\r\nIn order to align with the Fame House, her unscrupulous big brother actually 'sold' her　to Bluegreen-Clad, the boss of another major gang called the League of Strong Families.  \r\nYes, he was the local lord who was crazily admired by female players in the whole region.>"
