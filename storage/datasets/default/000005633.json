	"description": "Yuan Xi had a dream about a sexual encounter, only to discover after a night of pleasure that it had all been real. After being shocked silly for a long time, he ran away.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that a big grown man like him would become pregnant and have a son?\r\n\r\nThe question was, who is the child’s father? It had been too dark for Lao Tzu to see clearly!\r\n\r\nAlso, what was this daily life system that has been attached to him?\r\n\r\nFarming Skill\r\nRanching Skill\r\nHarvesting Skill\r\nCooking Skill\r\nBuilding Skill\r\nSkinning Skill\r\nSewing Skill\r\nSmithing Skill\r\n\r\n… There was a never-ending row of categories.\r\n\r\n老子 Lao Tzu: A way of referring to oneself, usually in angry or joking situations.>"
