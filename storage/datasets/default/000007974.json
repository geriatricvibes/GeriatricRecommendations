	"description": "He is Xi Liang’s legendary emperor: a decisive and ruthless king; a man of supreme wisdom; a cunning strategist.\n\nAccording to legend, he once conferred the love meant for the three thousand concubines in his harem onto one woman, while the world watched in envy. \n\nAccording to legend, he once executed a hundred people for her, turning the palace into a purgatory overnight. \n\nAccording to legend, he ultimately sentenced that same woman to death by execution… \n\nA conspiracy that swept through the country resulted in her tragic end. This lifetime seems to be a repeat of her past life. Can she escape the clutches of fate to attain true love in this life? In both lives, she was the Emperor’s wife, but is that ruthless man really her true love mandated by Heaven? \n\nDid she really die, just like that? \n\nIn the end, beyond the veil of lies and mysteries, who exactly was she? Was she a woman that he truly loved, or was she merely a chess piece to be used in his political machinations? \n\nThe stories passed onto later generations remain fraught with conflicting opinions.>"
