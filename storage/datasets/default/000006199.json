	"description": "Song Yuan accidentally picked up a 5-year-old child.\r\n\r\nThe child has bright eyes, chiseled features, and prideful demeanor. He referred to himself as 'this prince' and his mannerism was wild, cool, and stuck up.\r\n\r\n'This prince will never eat such lowly food!'\r\n\r\n'How dare you flirt with other men behind the back of my imperial father?'\r\n\r\n'He insulted this prince and you sided with him? This prince will sentence his entire clan to death!'\r\n\r\nSong Yuan was very disturbed. The DNA test had confirmed that the child was, indeed, her son, but why did he act like he was delusional?\r\n\r\nMore importantly, who was the father of the child?\r\n\r\nThe prince was going mad from worrying; Imperial Father, if you don't come soon, Imperial Mother is really going to cheat on you!>"
