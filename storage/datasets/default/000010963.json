	"description": "When Shu Tang, a sickly young woman, fell ill and passed away in the 21st century, she thought she would finally be able to drink a bowl of Meng Po’s soup, take a trip across the Neihe bridge, and not be such a sickly person in her next life. But, after her soul left her body, forget about Meng Po’s soup, she didn’t even see soup dregs before being transmigrated into the body of a pig! After being adopted by Fuyu Shangxian, one of the three great immortals and heaven’s peerless beauty, hilarity ensues.>"
