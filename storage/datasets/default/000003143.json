On one particular day of his boring life, a strange email arrives on his mobile phone. It is an invitation to the game known as [Innovate]. Out of boredom, Mitusya decides to register and participate in the gameâ€¦\n\nNote: While Mitsuya and characters from this novel appear on High School DxD, Ishibumi has stated they aren't related to this original version of the characters, but instead from a yet-to-be-published reboot of it.>"
