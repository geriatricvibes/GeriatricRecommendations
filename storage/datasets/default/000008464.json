	"description": "A young man, who was a beautiful elf and a duke, was being urged by the crown prince to get married. Because of his beauty, he, who had suffered from troubles with women since he was young, hates women.\r\n\r\nThen, he remembers a promise he made with a wizard ten years ago. It was a deal: “In exchange for my engagement to your daughter, let me read the forbidden books”.\r\n\r\nAt the time, finding a marriage partner was a hassle for him, so he easily accepted the conditions.\r\n\r\nThe duke immediately went home and was about to marry the wizard’s daughter, but he discovered a terrible truth.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl is touched by the opposite sex, she turns into a cat.\r\n\r\nHe hates his cheeky and strong-willed bride, but surprisingly, he is a huge cat lover.\r\n\r\nThe days of the Duke’s suffering begin now.>"
