	"description": "Waking up after a car accident, the first thing I saw was Yin Li’s handsome threatening face.\n\nIt made me somewhat embarrassed.\n\nBut in the end I had to be ruthlessly heartless, cursing while pointing at his shapely nose:\n\n“It looks like you’re the bastard who hit me!”\n\nHe blankly stared, and then coldly said:\n\n“I’m your fiancé. Yan Xiao, you have amnesia.”\n\nThen I had to persuade Yin Li, I was a wretched toad and wasn’t good enough for him.\n\nHe sneered, “Even if you grew wings to become a swan, you still wouldn’t be able to escape your birthright. Not to mention that you’re just a toad.”\n\nThis is definitely not the general amnesia plot that you have in your mind! You definitely won’t be able to guess it~>"
