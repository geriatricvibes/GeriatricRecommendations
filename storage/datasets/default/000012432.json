	"description": "Jasmine had an accident with her one-sided love, Duke Aion. The straightforward man, who didn’t bat an eye to her before, who is consistently ignorant of her, for some reason, was now catching feelings…\n\n“Didn’t you like me? Was that a lie?”\n\n“Why would I lie about that?”\n\n“I know. You’re not that kind of person.”\n\nShe was at that phase where she decided her damned love, but instead it turned for the worse.\n\nA enchanting love story between a noble couple that is at each other’s throats but in harmony during the night.>"
