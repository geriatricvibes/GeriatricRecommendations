In the end, he went to another company and shed his last ounce of strength to work. He unexpectedly met Chen Mo, the boss who hates gay men the most. A lot of interesting things happened between the two.\n\nYan Chen has always been disgusted and tired of Ye Mu, thinking that this is just a b*tch. After breaking up with Ye Mu, he decided to marry Gu Huai. But after marriage, he always recalls every bit of being with Ye Mu. He thinks it must be because he hates this person too much.\n\nHe started to look for Ye Mu time after time, and Ye Mu always refused. Yan Chen felt that it was nothing, this was merely another cheap trick by the other party to loosen the reins only to grasp him better.\n\nBut one day, when he found out that Ye Mu no longer loved him and was with Chen Mo, Yan Chen felt strange.\n\nWhy did he feel so tight in his chest, why did he feel so angry?\n\nThen things became very awkward.>"
