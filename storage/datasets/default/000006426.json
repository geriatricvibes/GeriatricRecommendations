	"description": "The ‘villain of the otome game’, who is this referring to?\n\n“Of course it’s me, Yukina.”\n\nThen, what is this ‘villain’ referring to?\n\n“One who interferes with the romance of the heroine with petty harassment and misdeeds, the type of person who’ll be hated by everyone.”\n\nIf so, why are there so many capturable targets gathering around you?\n\n“…… I’m the one who wants to ask that… hurry up and lose your hearts to the heroine…”\n\nEven the ‘heroine’ you were talking about seems to like you, why is that so?\n\n“That’s precisely what I want to know!!”>"
