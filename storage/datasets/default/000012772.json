	"description": "As a successor of Gu doctor, Xiao Chen was ordered to take Gu to the Orc Continent. To him who didn't know it yet, this continent was simply a holy place for making Gu. Until he met a behemoth that was going to die! Xiao Chen was silent, knowing that saving this behemoth would 'eat him', it would be better to let it rot to death in the forest. Offensive copywriting: During a hunt, he was seriously injured to save the tribe's patriarch, unable to transform. Unwilling to stay in the tribe and be pityed and discriminated against, he chose to escape. Until I met Xiao Chen. 'Woo-' I'm going to carry this little female home and sleep him! I don't know how to describe Gu doctors who are affected by VS as the force value exploded. Strong loyal dog muscle attack. Humans are males. Orcs who cannot be transformed are females.>"
