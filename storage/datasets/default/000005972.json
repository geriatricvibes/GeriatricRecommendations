	"description": "I, Ebato Ren, am an almost invisible first year high schooler. My presence is hopelessly small, and my name is practically unknown. \n\nOne day, after going back home from school, I found the “princess” of the school standing in the pouring rain, completely drenched, without an umbrella. She wouldn’t notice even when I called out to her, but luckily I was wearing a raincoat, so, I pushed my umbrella into her hands and ran. Well, no one is really aware of my existence anyway. I’ll think as if the umbrella is lost, and put it out of my mind. …or so I had thought.>"
