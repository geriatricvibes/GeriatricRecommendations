	"description": "In the distant future, Earth is heavily affected by consecutive nuclear wars and humans are barely surviving under a shield protecting their few “Unions.” Inside the Unions, people are classified from S to F based on their abilities/aptitudes and live in residential zones that match their classification.\n\nOur protagonist Jung Min was born as one of the 300,000 artificially inseminated children created to prepare for the future of mankind.  However, it turned out that he was aptitude-less (i.e. incompetent) and was thus pushed out to the F Zone, the most dangerous and outermost part of the Union. \n\nThen everything changes on his first day of Adulthood: Jung-min receives an advanced Virtual Reality capsule from his foster father for a game called ‘Beyond.’ >"
