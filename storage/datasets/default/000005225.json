	"description": "Sweet Pea, a romance writer who writes pure and sparkling stories.\r\n\r\nOne day, she saw a book that sold well in the dark. She became curious about the unfamiliar love affair scenes within this best selling book.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible to use it if I try it myself?”\r\n\r\nSweet Pea, who published an advertisement for ‘recruiting sex partners’ in the newspaper, declared this to her best friend Edward…….\r\n\r\n“I’m going to make a sex partner!”\r\n\r\n“…….What kind of partner are you going to make?”  \r\n\r\nEdward furrowed his brows in disbelief at Sweet Pea’s words.\r\n\r\nThinking he would never allow another man to covet her.\r\n\r\n‘I’d rather it be me as her partner.’\r\n\r\nAnd he visited Sweet Pea in the name of ‘De Niro’ wearing a specially made mask…….\r\n\r\n‘What a cute bunny!’\r\n\r\nIt was to chastise her for being such a lovely bunny.\r\n\r\nThe man’s rabbit hunting begins.\r\n\r\nBunny, leave the door open tonight!>"
