	"description": "Liu Ling, an unmarried activist, has been unrestrained all her life. Before her death, a friend asked her if she had an unfulfilled wish, and Liu Ling replied she could not raise a baby.\n\nThe friend fell into trouble; this is not easy to do. Not waiting for her friend to speak, Liu Ling said that if she gave birth to a child, the mother would die, and her child would live, so let’s forget it.\n\nUnfortunately, God heard.\n\nAfter her death, she did not enter the underworld and transmigrated into Song Zhaodi. She also had seven children, all of whom were not her own.>"
