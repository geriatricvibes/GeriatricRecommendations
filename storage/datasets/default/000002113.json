	"description": "Hei Xiao, who was a famous assassin, could never have imagined that one day, he would be shot in the head. This was retribution. \r\n\r\nBut he didn’t die. \r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, two men and a woman were gathered around the bed and kindly told him that he had ‘amnesia’: “You are our good, beloved coworker.”\r\n\r\nHei Xiao asked, “What’s our job?”\r\n\r\nThey replied, “The police~”\r\n\r\nHei Xiao was speechless.\r\n\r\nLooking at the strangely pale and thin face in the mirror in front of him, Hei Xiao wished he could die again: God, although I’ve sinned a lot, you don’t have to play me like this! >"
