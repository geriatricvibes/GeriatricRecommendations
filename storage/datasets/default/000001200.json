	"description": "I am a princess, moreover, I am a fool of a princess.\n\nBorn in the imperial palace, my appearance is as average as that of the white radish and cabbages in the fields. Throughout the four seasons of the year, my face is always displaying a dull expression, eyes forever shrouded in haze.\n\nBut in reality, I know of the secrets within this palace.\n\nIncluding hers, his, and theirs.\n\nJust leisurely living my days comfortably in the palace like this, I firmly believe I can continue to play dumb to the end.\n\nTaking your hand, dragging you away. Not leaving, you say? Very well, close the doors and release the hounds. (Expressionless face)>"
