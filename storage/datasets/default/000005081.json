	"description": "This is a sweet, love story of a sloth and a wolf after they transmigrate.\r\n\r\nOne is a lazy girl who eats and sleeps, sleeps and eats and the other is a big, bad, black-bellied, older brother next door.\r\n\r\nThe lazy girl hides from place to place for fear of being eaten. The big, bad, older brother tries every means to eat meat.\r\n\r\nThe big, bad, older brother grinds his teeth: “You are mine. Don’t think of escaping anywhere!”\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears: “Older brother Wolf, don’t eat me, okay?”\r\n\r\nHe says at a critical juncture: “Okay, then you eat me!”\r\n\r\nThus, the lazy girl who had just found a good man worthy of trust...... was tied up by her bad older brother and ate clean!\r\n\r\nA certain man’s declaration of love: What is a loyal dog? I will be a loyal wolf for you!>"
