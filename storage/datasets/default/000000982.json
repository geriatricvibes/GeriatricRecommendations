	"description": "Somehow, before the appearance of the female lead, I became the male lead’s temporary wife. Since things had already turned out this way, I decided to try my very best. However…\r\n\r\n“It’s so fortunate that someone like you became Cedric’s partner.”\r\n“…I’ll admit it. It’s a fortune that you were the one to become his wife, Dylan.”\r\n“It’s such a fortunate chance that you were the one to become the Lady of the Brighton House.”\r\n\r\n…I think I did too much of a good job.\r\n\r\nWhen Cedric’s destined partner arrives, I will have to leave. What should I do? To someone like that, Cedric had said this.\r\n\r\n“Would you have ever thought that the one I would fall in love with would be you?”\r\n\r\n…Would you still say the same to me after the real female lead, Adeline, makes her appearance?>"
