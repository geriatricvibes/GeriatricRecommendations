	"description": "After 12 years of training, Cedric Finn Raphael became a perfect paladin.\r\nReligious enough to be treated as a separate species, he\r\nis assigned to the palace of Princess Pine, the darkest and most eccentric in the Mihadas Empire.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to sleep with me?”\r\n“… … What did you just say?”\r\n“Sleep with me.”\r\n\r\nA garden like a monster forest, carefree servants,\r\na life that changes day and night, and even strange commands that are beyond common sense.\r\n\r\n“I am a paladin. A priest with a sword.”\r\n“I’ve slept with a priest before.” Cedric, who has been waiting for the day to be transferred to a place where everything is as strange as the character of Pine, the owner of the palace, one day learns the princess’s secret…\r\n… .\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“Would you like to guess what to do here?”\r\nPine naturally climbed onto his body. Pine stood up on his thigh and looked closely at his protruding trouser dance, before taking off his clothes. Then she took Cedric’s hand and led it between her legs. As she grabbed his hand again, as he was about to pull it out in surprise, Pine showed him where he should go.\r\n“Hey, I think it’ll be fine because it’s wet… … . I’m not going to put them all in because you’re a big guy, so I’ll try a little.”\r\nThe smooth liquid touched the tip of his finger. Cedric couldn’t face Pine any longer and lowered his head with a reddened face.>"
