	"description": "'The murderer died before killing anybody! You've got to uncover the truth!'\r\n\r\n'The robber not only took money from the bank but my accomplice too!'\r\n\r\n'I've kidnapped a rich man's son but I can only ask for 30 grand?! What lousy deal is this?!'\r\n\r\n'Who on earth meddled with my airbag?! I nearly died in that car accident!'\r\n\r\n'Only a swindler would know the secret behind this transaction, so you'd better call the police now!'\r\n\r\n'This is my last gig as a murderer, so pleeeaaase don't screw up!'\r\n\r\nIt's the most unfortunate of criminals vs the most egomaniacal police inspector in the history of mankind - this comedy of errors just keeps replaying itself.>"
