	"description": "She spent the night with the man who destroy her country, fleeing with their child in her arms. With that, she believed their relationship had come to an end.\n\n'Even if he's another man's child, even if he's not of my blood, or even if he's the child of a bastard, I'll raise him as my own.'\n\nUntil he came to her with eyes as ferocious as a beast.\n\n'Don't even think about running away using the boy as an excuse. I'm still struggling to control the urge to crush the little creature that took you away from me.'>"
