	"description": "Everything Judy touches is put to sleep. Even though she can’t even have a lover because of this curse, she is to marry the ill-rumored “Magician of the Staircase”!\r\n\r\nHowever, the goal of the magician – who she thought came to pick her up – was just a sample of Judy’s blood. He rejected Judy with… “Marriage? Me? Don’t be silly, it’s quite enough to be single for this entire life.”?!\r\n\r\nThis is a love fairy tale between a young girl and a frustrating and socially awkward evil magician!>"
