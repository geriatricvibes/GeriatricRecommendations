	"description": "Having recently lost his job and dumped by his girlfriend, Subaru decides to travel to Hokkaido to “see the stars”. In Hokkaido, he is reunited with his high school classmate, Tokizawa, who harbors unrequited feelings for him. They haven’t seen each other since the day Tokizawa confessed during their graduation ceremony, and now they’re going to live together for one month. Ten years have passed since, but Tokizawa’s persistent feelings start to confuse Subaru and perhaps he may even feel something backー.>"
