	"description": "An unexplained malfunction transforms what should have been a pleasure trip through space into a waking nightmare.\n\nSix human crew and passengers are on board; the escape pod only fits two.\n\nWho lives and who dies? It’s up to the captain to decide. Fortunately, his humanoid navigator Elise is there to assist.\n\nBut will she ease, or worsen, his burden of choice?\n\nTwo of Six: A Captain’s Dilemma is a thought-provoking SF story reminiscent of '12 Angry Men' that touches on what it means to be human–or this *almost* human.>"
