I am the fiancee of His Highness, the Crown Prince.\r\nI was reincarnated in this world similar to the otome game I was addicted to in the past as a villain.\r\nWhat I wish for is the happiness of His Royal Highness. To that end, I have continued to harass the heroine, aiming for the happy ending between her and His Highness. And today was the day of my conviction.>"
