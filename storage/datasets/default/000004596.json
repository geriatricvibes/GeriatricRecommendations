	"description": "I reincarnated as Rowaine, the villainess who was fated to be executed for the sin of mistreating a shapeshifter. To escape death, I decided to replace my sister, Renee, in her arranged marriage.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the person I was to be wed to, the notoriously cold-blooded Duke Blois, was a cat person.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Darling, I heard that abusing shapeshifters like me is a hobby of yours.”\r\n“From what I understand, there was no such condition that a woman who mistreats shapeshifters could never be the Duke’s marriage partner.”\r\n\r\nHis emerald eyes flashed dangerously. I quickly added before he could say anything else.\r\n\r\n“If my hobby will pose a problem, then I promise that I will never play with the Duke.”\r\n\r\n“Ha?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a 10-year contract marriage between a cat butler and a feisty cat shapeshifter.>"
