How titties sway every time you swing them? \n\nAspiring to become a sword saint, Ruga was chosen to join the Order of the Holy Knights because of his sincerity and swordsmanship. He was assigned to the 6th Order, which is rumored to be “hell”.\n\nRuga was prepared for a grueling mission, but instead, he met the beautiful, busty leader of the order, Leon Myrie. \n\nWelcome, Ruga, as the only male Holy Knight in the Sixth Order. \n\nTurn to the right and you’ll see big tits! Turn to the left and you’ll see beautiful women everywhere! Can Ruga’s rational mind withstand the absolute inevitability of knighthood (harem)?>"
