	"description": "Masato Kazama is 26 years old. He is a salaryman working at a high pressure company… an advertising agency. He is what you would call a “corporate drone.”\r\n\r\nMasato’s junior, the new-graduated employee Nagisa Inami, is the perfect heroine.\r\nShe is beautiful, stylish, and is quick to learn her job. In addition, she is friendly and sociable. If there is one drawback to Nagisa, it is that she likes her trainer, Masato, a little too much.\r\n\r\nA relationship between the two may begin to be born in this story…. Or not.>"
