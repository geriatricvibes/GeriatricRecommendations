	"description": "She had a lifetime of fake virtue without receiving a virtuous ending. In the next lifetime, she controls fates with the flip of her hand. To the jerk who wasn’t faithful, she’ll draw a premature death talisman for him. For the poisonous step mother, she’ll send a death flower. For the step sister who is two faced, she’ll personally rip off that fake pretty face!\n\nBut when she personally offered up her body to her nemesis because of a child who she had no fate with, something unexpected happened. The night of the big wedding, the groom changed and a cold and luxurious man pushed her down. “You can marry whoever you like, but you can only give birth to my children!”>"
