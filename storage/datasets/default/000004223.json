	"description": "How did he meet such a bandit-like man? He drags you away the second he sees you! And yet, the only thing he can do is try his best to set the boundaries between them.\n\n***\n\n“Don’t you ever try to leave and reason things out. It’s futile. Yelling is also useless. This Laozi has already fallen for you and I shall make you mine.”\n\n***\n\n“Be obedient and wait for me at home, so I can pamper you till the day I die.”\n\n***\n\n“Running away? What about it?\n\nYou dare to run away again and this Laozi will spend his lifetime seeing you try.”>"
