	"description": "A long time ago, it was said that an oracle would descend; that the daughter of God will be born.\n\nThe oracle was either me…or my twin sister.\n\n“Useless. You are the disgrace of this household, Helia.”\n\nFather, who was convinced that my younger sister, whose abilities had been revealed earlier, was the daughter of God, foolishly blamed me and treated me cruelly, killing me.\n\nBut what he didn’t know was that the actual daughter of god was me, Helia.\n\nI don’t know about the empire, but mother god is on my side.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was back at the age of 18.\n\n“You will lay out his punishment, Helia.”\n\nIn this life, I will not die.>"
