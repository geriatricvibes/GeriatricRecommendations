	"description": "What was a true Miracle-working doctor? A doctor who could kill others! When killing one person could save a hundred people, how would he choose? Kill! This was a different Miracle-working doctor; his miracle cure brought the dying back to life, thus, someone engraved his name on the eternal memorial tablet and worshiped him day and night. He was reviled by someone else who was eager to peel off his skin, pull out his tendons, and curse him day and night. He carried the medicine gourd with his left hand and cured the sick with his acupuncture needles; he held the killing sword with his right hand and cut off someone’s heads. He could save the sick and also kill the evil!>"
