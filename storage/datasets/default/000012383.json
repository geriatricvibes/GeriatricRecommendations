	"description": "Bai Junzhuo wakes up to smoke, realizing that she is surrounded by fire. But didn't I just die? She thinks to herself. And now sheâ€™s been reborn. Before she died of an infection by an ancient bacterium, she was a microbiologist. After being saved by a servant, she learned that she was the daughter of Dr. Bai Gonglu. However, her concubine mother, Lin Bailian, took away all of the Bai Clan's property after Dr. Bai Gonglu's death, leaving a huge debt behind. When the debt collector came to ask for money, they set everything on fire. Before Bai Junzhuo could catch her breath, two men carrying knives found her.>"
