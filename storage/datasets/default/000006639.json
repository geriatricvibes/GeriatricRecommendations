Xu Zhen treated and loved the little beggar in every possible way.\r\n\r\nHowever, during a certain day, the system pointed out to her, this little beggar was a big villain, and Xu Zhen this small cannon fodder would sooner or later die due to the big villain.\r\n\r\nXu Zhen cried.\r\n\r\nShe quickly retreated 3 feet away from the little beggar, kneeled down and kowtow, “I’m wrong already, I won’t dare to ever make you recognize words and do homework, please spare me and let me return to the countryside to live my life.”\r\n\r\nWith a cold expression, the little beggar calmly told her, “Begging for forgiveness now? Too late already.”>"
