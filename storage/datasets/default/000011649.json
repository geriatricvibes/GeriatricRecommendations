	"description": "Surrounded by many different kinds of companions, our protagonist: Hopeless siscon Hashima Itsuki. \n\n1st class genius and lover, the high end unfortunate-beauty Kani Nayuta. \n\nTroubled about love, troubled about friendships, troubled even in her dreams, victor of the 3 crowns Shirakawa Miyako. \n\nBrutal tax sabre, Ōno Ashley. \n\nNatural born illustrator, Puriketsu. \n\nEach and every one as hesitant as the next, and each and every one dealing with their own headaches. This is a busy story of a group of bewildering characters that play games together, take trips together, and work together, never a single dull day. \n\nWatching over them is the kind and thoughtful, completely perfect, superhuman little brother of Itsuki; Chihiro, with a huge secret of his own―. \n\nFrom the author that brought you ‘Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai’ (‘Haganai’), Hirasaka Yomi has drawn the curtains for the latest youth love-comedy series!>"
