	"description": "Rumor had it that Shen Chengfeng, the top general in the empire, had a quirk—no one was allowed to touch his body! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHowever, one day, not only was he touched, he was also bedded! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRumor had it that the Xiao family, renowned throughout the empire, had produced only generals. However, she, Xiao Jing, was a girl. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe had no choice but to disguise herself as a male and be a foot soldier. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe secret that the Shen family was hiding was that anyone who came in contact with Shen Chengfeng’s skin would die. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut Xiao Jing touched it accidentally! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEveryone in the Shen family knew that Shen Chengfeng’s hands were like strong sulfuric acid—it corroded anything it touched. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut Xiao Jing touched it accidentally! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was tacitly understood among the members of the Shen family that due to the special properties of the Empire’s top general, he would never be able to marry and bear children. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut one day, this same general suddenly announced that he was going to marry a foot soldier!>"
