	"description": "I think you’ve lost if you fall in love.\n\n—Hinooka Homura. Seiran High School 1st year.\n\nShe likes to talk with friends. She dislikes essays. She’s the type that gets sleepy after thinking for too long. Basically, she has the air of someone who had failed her high school debut. Her classmate Touya Takumi surprised her one day by asking, “Why don’t you try becoming a mage?”\n\nWithout fully understanding what she was getting herself into, Homura soon finds herself and Touya joining up with the Exploration Club president, a Yamato Nadeshiko named Misasagi Mayo, and a magically powered golem/android named Ameno in order to explore a recently discovered sister planet to Earth named Nutella. Nutella is enormous in size, easily dwarfing Jupiter, and yet somehow it is mysteriously and magically linked with Earth. \n\n>"
