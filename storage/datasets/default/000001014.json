	"description": "Thor Regus, a boy who lived in the empire, was banished to the territory of the Demon Lord by the hands of his father, the Duke.\n\nThe reason was that he could only use [Alchemy] and didn’t have any combat skills.\n\nThe empire was a military country, and those without combat skills were discriminated against.\n\nThat is why the Empire decided to make him a hostage and sacrifice to the Demon Territory.\n\nThis is a story about an exiled boy who transcends Empires and Heroes and transforms the Demon Territory into a civilized power.>"
