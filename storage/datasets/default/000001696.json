	"description": "The three most basic human’s desire are hunger, sleeping and sexual desire. I was transferred into another world and for that reason, it was only a matter of course that I lost those three things. Everything I ate tasted so bad to the point I felt nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a nightmare and jolted me awake. As for my son, my son didn’t react to anything, not even a twitch.\r\n\r\nIn order to break free from this predicament, I quit my current job as a knight and went on a journey.\r\n\r\nWhy did I come to this world? Why did I become like this? I went on a journey in order to find the answer to these questions….\r\n\r\n……… And yet, why did the yandere knight captain come following me?!>"
