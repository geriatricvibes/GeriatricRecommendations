	"description": "In a rotted away castle, Ashta awoke as a Demon King.\n\nWith his ‘wisdom from a past life’, he would rule over his lands as a thorough ‘realist’.\n\n“Demon King, why are you attacking the level 1 Heroes?”\n\n“Defeat them before they become stronger. That is called strategy.”\n\n“Demon King, why are you sending fake money to the enemy country?”\n\n“To bring chaos to their economy so they will self-destruct.”\n\n“The werewolf troops have attacked. Should we use silver bullets?”\n\n“Not bullets, shoot them with canons.”\n\nAnd like that, Ashta ‘reformed’ the old tendencies.\n\nHe became a lord who was loved by the people and his subordinates and would go on to be called the most powerful Demon King in history.>"
