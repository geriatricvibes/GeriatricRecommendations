	"description": "For the past year, Wu Yu had been experiencing the same vivid dream. As he stood alone before a cliff with strong winds, he heard someone call his name. Amid his confusion, he found her name.\r\n\r\n'You will never regret it? Always being nice to me?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll never regret it.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, it’s settled then.”\r\n\r\nWe made a promise to each other, from this day forward till death. Regardless of how space-time changed, whether our memories would be erased, or how history would end up, our love would remain true. Time has engraved you into my heart, making it bleed.\r\n\r\nTan Jiao could still recall that ship’s appearance. She had always longed for this trip. Unexpectedly, it would change her destiny. Their lives were knitted together on that very ship. After that trip, they fell into the turbulent river of time. As if it were merely a dream, this world without time left them unharmed and their memories intact. If a person had loved so deeply, they would never forget any of it. Even if they lost their memories, their sense of time, their lives… Even if they lost everything.>"
