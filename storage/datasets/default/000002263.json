	"description": "She was reborn in the alien world and existed in the form of half-human and half-vampire. Unfortunately, she was recognized by neither race. Survival required disguise. As time went by, she found she was having a grand mission and she needed to save the world which would be dominated by the Magic Race. Right at this moment, the original owner of her body started coming to life and it was in no way an ordinary human being.\r\n>"
