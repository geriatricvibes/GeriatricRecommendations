	"description": "After being reborn as a female automaton in another world, I hide my past life, working as a maid for the sorcerer that created me. I was used to taking care of myself in the past, so working on house chores was easy for me, and my new body is attuned to the powerful magic hand gun given to me by the sorcerer.\r\n\r\nMy new life was sometimes difficult, sometimes enjoyable, and sometimes I questioned my own worth, not being a human anymore, or an actual living being for that matter. \r\n\r\nWhat are the goals of such a powerful sorcerer? \r\n\r\nWill her daughter's love for an automaton ever be realized?\r\n\r\nDeciding to keep all my doubts and emotions secret, I try to find my reason to live as a former man living inside a maid automaton.>"
