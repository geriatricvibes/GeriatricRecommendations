	"description": "In romance novels, no matter how much the man hurts the woman, the woman still loves the man.\r\n\r\nThe man has the face and the money but not the heart to love the woman.\r\n\r\nLord! He just couldn’t give a little pity to the lady and she didn’t even end up in a good place.\r\n\r\nSu Yunluo said: I’m very unconvinced! Are you blind, Mistress? You have to like the scum lord instead of the sweet and kind man! If it were me, I would have kicked out the scum master and lived happily ever after with my man!\r\n\r\nSo, “unfortunately”, her voice was captured by the system, and she entered the world of quick transmigration as she wished. To rescue the man in love and join hands with him on the road to happiness and richness!>"
