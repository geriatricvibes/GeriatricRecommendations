	"description": "There once existed an honorable founder of this panguan school of cultivation. His reputation was illustrious, but nowadays nobody dared to mention him. Even if they did, all they said was, “He met a miserable end.”\n\nOnly Wen Shi still abided by the rules. Every day, he would pay respects to the founder’s ferocious, colorful portrait, but because of that he ended up summoning a sickly tenant.\n\nThe tenant stood in front of the portrait and asked, “Who drew this?”\n\nWen Shi: “Me.”\n\nDon’t ask. If you do, you’ll just end up feeling touched.>"
