	"description": "An email of the research and development for the third-generation aero-engine project appeared in the mailbox of the flight academy. Everyone who checked the email was dumbfounded.\n\n“The great god who developed the third-generation aero-engine by himself is an ordinary undergraduate? Am I crazy or is this a lie?”\n\nThe person who checked the email felt incredulous, but out of responsibility, he still reported the email. It didn’t take long for an internal message from the Aero Engine Research Institute to spread:\n\n“Under the leadership of a chief engineer that is less than twenty years old, the third-generation aero-engine was successfully created.”\n\nIn less than a year, the fifth-generation fighter jet was successfully developed and became the most advanced fighter in the world.\n\nFor a while, everyone was shocked.>"
