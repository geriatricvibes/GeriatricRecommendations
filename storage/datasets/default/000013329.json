	"description": "I remembered. In my previous life, I was referred to as a fujoshi. And that this world is a BL game I have played back then. Not to mention.. my big brother is actually the protagonist! What kind of blessed life is this?!\n\nHowever, it’s a pity that my brother is already in a secret relationship with his childhood friend. When all is said and done, I can only watch as the game’s main story timeline came to an end. Isn’t this basically the God amusing oneself by messing with this poor soul?! Really?? God?? When I can finally witness a real life BL, why must my joy be tempered with?! God! Ain’t this a bit too cruel of a treat!\n\nWell, it’s alright I guess. In fact, to be able to experience this is already totally amazing. And the delicious treat is already served! Therefore, I will feed myself by observing the capture targets that was not tied to my brother!\n\n… And that would be the first blunder I made. How could I forget… the fact that I looked so much like my brother–!>"
