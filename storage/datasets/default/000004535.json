	"description": "After a night, surprisingly I acquired a husband!\n\nWell, the fact is that after a one-night stand, I unwittingly signed a marriage agreement. There isn’t a bad in-law relationship but instead a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law alliance.\n\nThe purpose of our alliance: Make my husband interested in women!\n\nFrankly speaking, a man who isn’t interested in a woman … is he gay? Having a husband who is suspected to be gay, I will fight for him and not let him go astray.\n\nSo I raise my eyebrows and with a wicked smile: My dear husband, wait and see how I am going to teach you to be a real man!>"
