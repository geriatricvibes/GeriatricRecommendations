	"description": "Ye Xuan, relying on his wood-type ability, had been fighting for ten years in the apocalypse. He survived the early apocalyptic period of moral collapse, passed through the middle of the apocalypse with multi-party struggles, and finally reached the stage of order and stability. His post apocalyptic life was finally on track.\n\nJust as he was thinking about whether to spawn a watermelon or an apple as a fruit after dinner, a white light flashed, and he returned to the time before the world ended.\n\nYe Xuan: WTF!\n\nYe Xuan, who had just been reborn: I don’t want to be reborn, please send me back!\n\nYe Xuan a few months later: Coming to the past could not be remonstrated and being reborn was quite good.\n\nHe was not a good person in the traditional sense. He only did whatever he wanted to do. Rather than being cold to everyone, he was soft only to those close to him.>"
