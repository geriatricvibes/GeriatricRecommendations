	"description": "The new virtual reality online game that is revolutionizing the world of online gaming is finally released!\r\n\r\nAll the keyboard gamers are flocking over it. Wen Zhi was lucky to become the beta tester. She entered the game with great enthusiasm and only to find out that the game content was simply outrageous…\r\n\r\nWhat?! She had to flirt with an NPC, m*sturbate in front of her teammates, and to unlock the BOSS in the dungeon, she even has to make love?!\r\n\r\nWen Zhi felt that these tasks were too difficult for a single dog like her.\r\n\r\nJust when she was about to quit the game, she met the God-like player from the previous game she had played…\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Wen Zhi felt very motivated to continue the game~>"
