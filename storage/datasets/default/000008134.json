	"description": "Xue Si, the fourth son of the Xue Family, was nearly disabled in a world where people cultivated for immortality, because he did not possess Douqi (a sort of Qi, or energy, used for fighting) by the time he was 16. But Xue Si had his own thoughts about this and he not only overcame the difficulty of not having Douqi, but also cultivated himself into an immortal in the ancient world where he was living, and then started his journey to conquer the universe and the planets in another time-space.>"
