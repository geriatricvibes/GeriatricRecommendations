	"description": "When Ye Zhong woke up, he found that everything had changed. Not only was his Spiritual Power gone, his beautiful Master disappeared too.\n\nHe himself had become the trash of the noble Ye Clan, a cripple who couldn't cultivate. Furthermore, he was being coerced into changing his wedding agreement. Countless people were also after his pitiful life.\n\nIf he wanted to change his own fate and go against the Heavens, he had to become stronger, strong to the point that he could cover the sky with one hand, and become the Strongest Martial God!>"
