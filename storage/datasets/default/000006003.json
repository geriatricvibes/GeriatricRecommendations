	"description": "As a Spirit Messenger, I was reincarnated in a monster-infested earth. \n\nBut here, there is no such thing as a spirit. \n\n“Lucky.” \n\nMonsters? Dungeon? Those sorts of things are for hunters to solve, right? As a non-awakened person, I just had to enjoy the normal life I had dreamed of. \n\nBut by chance- which wasn’t really by chance- I touched an unidentified egg from dungeon.  \n\n「 Congratulations! ‘Yu Ina’ has awakened! 」 \n\n“……What?” \nI could hear my soothing life moving away. \n\n[Hahaha! She’s a contractor!] [My contractor!] \n\n“Who’s your contractor?” \n\nIt was already sad to be a spirit messenger again, but the spirits only caused accidents.  That was not even the end of the matter. \n\n“If you want to get out, get out.” \nI’m ranked No. 1 in Korea, which somehow ends up with me being treated as a part-time nanny. \n\n“Now that I see you, you’re a special person.” \nTo the head of the Hunter Association, who drags luxury sedans around and puts me in trouble. \n\n“I want to get closer to you. As a person to person.” \nEven the guild leader of the big guild that we encounter often! \n\n“Everyone, get lost.” \nGive me back my peaceful life!>"
