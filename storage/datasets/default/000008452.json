She realizes that she has been reincarnated into the world of an otome game but she can't quite believe it.\r\n\r\nIn the game, Grace's paternal half-sister Mira is the heroine, while Grace herself is the sadistic elder sister,the so-called Villainess who torments her younger sibling. However, with a newfound maturity from her past life memories, upon meeting her sister, her protective instinct as elder sister was awakened. Grace, who suddenly developed a major sister complex, was suddenly inspired by a new thought:\r\n\r\n'Since Father is a scumbag, the one who protects my sister must be me!'\r\n\r\nJust like in the game, the evil stepmother and target characters to woo such as the brother-in-law show up, creating challenges and opportunities!\r\n\r\nTo have her cute little sister call her 'Big Sister' with respect is Grace's deepest desire!!!>"
