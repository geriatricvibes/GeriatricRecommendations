She survives this, and wakes up in a mysterious garden where she is met by two vampire girls -- Calen and Trill. They ask her to join their cause and let them drink her blood, to which the woman agrees. However, drinking blood turns out not to be such a simple task. Something is needed. That something is sexual arousal...\r\n\r\nAnd so, Rosa's days of her body being developed in the hands of the girls begin.>"
