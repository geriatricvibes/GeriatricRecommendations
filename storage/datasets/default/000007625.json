	"description": "I was accused of attempting to kill my younger sister. \n\nNo one believed in me, no one came to help me up. Even my own family. \n\n14-year-old Alyssa. I was a 4th princess of Edenbell, and I died miserably in front of a lot people. \n\nI looked at my younger sister, hoping she would stop them from killing me. \n\nBut what I saw was a devil laughing happily at the sight of me dying. \n\nAfter being executed I opened my new eyes. I was in someone’s womb and I could hear voices. \n\nBefore falling unconscious again I heard a boy’s voice saying:\n\n“Welcome, my precious little sister” He laughed warmly “The whole world loves you.” \n\nShe was reborn as the first princess of the Emir empire, who was a rival of the Edenbell empire.>"
