	"description": "My little sister hanged herself, and my devastated mother called me. An amused trespasser showed me a video of my sister's rape, and pointed me to the location of the rapists' beloved daughters. I grab my stun gun and enact my kidnapping plan. But the city is also home to Jack the Stabber, whom 77 girls have fallen prey to.>"
