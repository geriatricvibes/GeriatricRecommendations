	"description": "When I opened my eyes, I was inside a fantasy novel world!\r\n\r\nThe beauty I see in front of the mirror is the future tyrant's older sister, Alicia!\r\nShe's not even a protagonist or an antagonist, but a character that doesn't appear much and gets beheaded by the (upcoming) tyrant little brother.\r\n\r\nMy life is all about escaping that fate from the novel.\r\nIn the end, I seduced the male lead's merchant friend who also doesn't appear much and was about to leave the country with him.\r\n\r\nHow-e-ver.\r\nThe face of the man who spent the night with me was extraordinary.\r\n\r\n'I-I'm pretty sure the name I heard yesterday wasn't that name but something else. Uhm, what was it. I-I think it's Sir Lancelot.'\r\n'Ah, that's my friend.'\r\n'...'\r\n'Why, is there a problem?'\r\n\r\nExcuse me, you're asking if there's a problem? A lot. There's a lot.\r\n\r\nWhy is the male lead on my bed!>"
