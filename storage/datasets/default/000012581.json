	"description": "Cordelia, the youngest daughter of the kingdom’s most powerful family, is a socialite with a lovely beauty that catches everyone’s attention.\n\nHowever, the truth is that it is Lawrence Blanc, the author of many works, including the popular romance novel .\n\n“Ah, love and novels, beat them all!”\n\nAs she leads her double life as her elegant princess by day and a romance writer by night, Cordelia, who has suffered a slump due to the exhaustion of her material, has a bizarre experience… .\n\n“Huh, what is this?”\n\nInstead of the pretty face she had been accustomed to seeing, her tall man blinked through her mirror. Unlike her black hair, blue eyes, and her delicate face, her wide shoulders and forearms were impressive.\n\nCrazy, Cordelia muttered involuntarily.\n\n“He’s so handsome!”\n\nThe man who was her ideal type was looking at her.>"
