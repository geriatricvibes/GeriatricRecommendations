	"description": "The Zhuang Lady sent her dog, Yin Huayue, to keep an eye on him and confine him. She is cold-blooded and hypocritical, and always has a fake smile on her face. Helping him get ready, combing his hair, and lighting the lamps. Awake for twelve hours a day, Li Jingyun spends ten hours thinking about how to make her leave. But after that, she actually left. He became anxious.\n\nDespite our brief time together, we are not appreciated despite our strength. Rather be alone, instead of withering alongside with another.>"
