	"description": "If “family” is the best gift that the Heavens can bestow, then why do the Heavens take back her present? She has no kin, no family, and no one to back her in case she foil up at work.\n\nBecause she is alone, she pours all her energy into work.\n\nBecause she is lonely, her boss becomes her emotional pillar.\n\nShe thought she has reached a state where she is numb …. until the day she meets him.\n\nHe is a good looking but bad-tempered ice skating athlete. He has the meanest mouth, but when she is in trouble, he is the one who dashes to her aid without reservations.  And when she is at her lowest moment, he offers his home for her to stay without asking any questions. His caring and gentleness moved her, but despite everything, she cannot help but feel a deep-rooted unease. After all, how much love do they really share? Is it enough to last a lifetime?>"
