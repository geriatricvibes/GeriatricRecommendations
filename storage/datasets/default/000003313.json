	"description": "When I was 15-years-old, during the year that I graduated from middle school, my father told me this.\n\n“The Devil’s blood runs in our family.”\n\nThat was the truth. Sadly my father was the owner of a takeaway chicken shop with the talent of turning his eyes blue, and I was the son of the takeaway shop who just happened to be slightly stronger than others.\n\nBut five years later.\n\nThey came for me.>"
