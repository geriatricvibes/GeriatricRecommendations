As an enchanter, he was responsible to adjust equipment of party members.\r\n\r\nBut one day,\r\n\r\n“We are the strongest party, even without your enchantment.”\r\n\r\nHe was fired from the party.\r\n\r\nForcefully he restarted his life in a remote area.\r\n\r\nHe could make weapons that let amateurs released power beyond their standard. Using that kind of weapon, he who had no fighting experience could increase it rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his previous party, which lose his enchantment ability, started to lose their power and authority.>"
