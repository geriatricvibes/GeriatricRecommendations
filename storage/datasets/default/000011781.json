	"description": "I wasn’t able to overcome the harassment and took my life, but I was reincarnated with the perpetrator? The perpetrator is the heroine, Florre, and I am the villainess, Dahlia, who’s going to die horribly. \n\n“They said you are a villain with neither blood nor tears, but unlike the rumors, you often shed tears.”\n\n“Your Highness must believe all the nonsense the idiots are talking about, huh?”\n\nGrand Duke of Cervian, the half brother of the Male lead and who will be punished for treason afterwards. He approached me. I can’t lose the man who will be my greatest ally. \n\n“Your Highness, would you marry me?”\n\n“Now…… what did you say?”\n\n“And take revenge together.” \n\nA similar situation, a fixed ending. The heroine is not the only one who knows the ending of the novel. I took a long and arduous path of revenge.>"
