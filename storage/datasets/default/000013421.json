Since then, she was covered from fighting someone and taught when doing homework.\n\nWhat evil step-mother, scum step-sister, black hearted white lotus, Mr. Bo will go all out to kill!\n\nBeing pampered and held in the palm of his hands, the conqueror of his heart, Mu Huan, was interviewed one day.\n\n“Mrs. Bo, what is the secret to you and Mr. Bo’s everlasting love?”\n\n“I like him the most, and he likes me best.”>"
