	"description": "Everyone in District 13 knows that Little King Next Door is not the son of Old King Next Door. But they don’t know that Little King Next Door is reborn.\n\nThe moment Wang Ye died with all his enemies, he relaxed and thought: Damn it, he’s finally dead, this life is worth it, that’s all.\n\nWho would have thought that he would be reborn in the most f**ked uptime of his life?\n\nThis was when the world had just launched a holographic game called “Extreme Danger”.\n\nWang Ye, who was super poor in his previous life, did not have access to this game until he was nineteen, and by then he was already lagging behind many others. But even so, with his fear of death and tenacity, he made his way in this world, and later even discovered the secrets of this world.\n\nNow he will enter this game eleven years early..>"
