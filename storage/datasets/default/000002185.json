	"description": "I was condemned as a villainess when I died, but I somehow returned to the past as a five-year-old.\n\nThe moment I faced my father, who now looked younger, a strange blue window appeared before my eyes—it was a light blue window that revealed someone else’s true feelings.\n\n[ Alderuan Erveldote ]\n\nOccupation: Emperor (Lv.99)\nFavorability: 90,980,984\nMood: ♡ My Daughter ♡ I – Miss – You\n\n. . . But Father?\n\nI suppose that’s how you really feel, but . . . what the hell’s going on . . . ?\n\n[ Damian Erveldote ]\n\nMood: Excited to see ♡ my sister ♡\nThoughts: I wanna talk to you T^T\n\n[ Ellie ]\n\nMood: Holding back from breaking the wall due to overwhelming cuteness\nThoughts: I’ll make a collection commemorating the cute princess’s daily life! ★\n\n[ Karmen Kasselov ]\n\nMood: Excited\nThoughts: Why do you look prettier and prettier every time I look at you? What do they feed you at the palace? Do they have a kind of medicine that could make people pretty like this?\n\nI thought you all hated me, but I guess not?!\n\nIf the status window was telling the truth about their moods and thoughts, then maybe I could live a different life this time around!>"
