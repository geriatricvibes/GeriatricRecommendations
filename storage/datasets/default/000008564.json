	"description": "As someone with main character aura, Ye Xing, age 17, already possessed unrivaled strength.  In his master’s word, in order to reach that supreme realm of cultivation, one must experience the trials of the mortal world.  Three thousand questions asked of dust (Three thousand experiences in the mortal world); everyone drinking and laughing together.  This is a spoofed xianxia story.  If it can earn a laugh from you readers, then that would be best. No more talking, serve the tea, this story is about to start.>"
