	"description": "The Jinyiwei: Formerly known as the “Ceremonial Luan Division ”, they had originally served as the Imperial Court’s honor guards, before gradually gaining Emperor’s trust. For one to assume the roles and responsibilities of the Jinyiwei, one would need to possess a certain type of background, the character of a faithful hound, a very good physique, and mastery of martial arts. Their uniform consists of flying fish clothing and they bear embroidered spring knives.\n\nThis is a story about the youngsters of the Brocade Imperial Guards or Jinyiwei.\n It is also a tale about a small, feral cat and a large, wild leopard.>"
