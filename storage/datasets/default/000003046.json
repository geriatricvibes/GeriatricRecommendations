	"description": "For the sin of adultery, I was sentenced to death.\n\n“Only God will know of my sin, and even at this moment I have nothing to be ashamed of.”\n\nAs soon as I finished talking, people started calling me a witch. Amidst the chaos, I definitely saw someone’s despicable smile. And when I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the moment right before my marriage.\n\nWho killed my husband?\n\nWho caused the downfall of my household?\n\nAnd who accused me of falling into adultery?\n\nI have to know. Everything. Not only a fancy duchess…\n\nBut I will become an elegant villainess and definitely destroy those people.>"
