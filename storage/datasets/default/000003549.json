But the two still cannot live to an old age in marital bliss. Unexpectedly, Shi Jian was transported back to when she was 21 years old.\n\nTwenty-one years old is the beginning of youth, the best time of your life. Time let her meet the twenty-five years old Ye Jia Cheng, ahead of time.\n\nAt this time her “Mr. Ye” was still handsome and talented. Unfortunately, he did not love her.\n\n“Ye Jia Cheng … I’m really your future wife … really.”\n\n“Impossible, little fox, I am in the Don’t Want to Get Married Group.>"
