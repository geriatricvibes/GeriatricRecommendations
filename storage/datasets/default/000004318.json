	"description": "Lin Ning transmigrated into the future, taking over the body of a fallen idol with a reputation worse than tr*sh— a waste of a beautiful face that might as well have been gifted by the heavens themselves.\n\nBut he only enjoyed experimenting with food, and so left the entertainment industry to tap into his cooking livestream potential, on the way picking up a cold, distant kitty with crazy fighting skills.\n\nWho would’ve thought that he’d once again be under the spotlight after leaving the industry, this time going viral throughout space with his food? The fans cry and scream for the has-been idol to once again return onstage.\n\n***\n\nAt first, the kitty only thought that Lin Ning was very special\n\nThen, film stars and bigshots began bugging Lin Ning daily and those horrible rumours started to plague him \n\nBA-BAM!\n\nThe Marshal, who took on a human form so suddenly pulled him into his chest and announced, in front of the entirety of space:\n\nThis Lin Ning— he’s mine.>"
