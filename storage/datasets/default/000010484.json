	"description": "“You are mine, and I am yours…”\n\nThe world cannot be saved by the victory of a single man. This book begins at the point where the climax should occur; the battle between a Demon Queen who is a little strange and a Hero who is a little curious.\n\nHowever, not only do these two give up the battle, instead, they join hands to directly challenge the complicated social structure which dictates that humans and demons must forever be in conflict.\n\nThis is too reckless right? How can this be done? Undoubtedly, you are thinking that.\n\nCome, please turn the page. You are about to read a story that has never been told before; the story of the Hero… and the Demon Queen.>"
