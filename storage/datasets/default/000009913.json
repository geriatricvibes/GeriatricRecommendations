	"description": "'The light will soon bring infinite glory and prosperity to the Empire of Firenze, while the dark will swallow the light and eventually bring the Empire to ruin!'\n\nThe first oracle from God after 100 whole years. Princess Ashutarte, with the memories of her miserable past life intact, reincarnated.\nShe tried becoming a person loved by her own family, unlike what happened to her in her past life.\n\n“Don’t call me that way unless you have a death wish.”\n\nNo matter how much she tried, all she received were cold glares and words. When she realized that no matter what she did their reaction would not change, she started to consider their love as meaningless.\nBut when did they start looking out for her with such pleading eyes?\n\n***\n\n“Ashutarte. It’s unfortunate, but it’s impossible for everyone to love you.”\n\nYes, in the end, I’m just darkness and nothing more.\nBut her heart, which was slowly sinking in the darkness, was then melted like snow by Leon’s words.\n\n“That means, you don’t have to love everyone either.”>"
