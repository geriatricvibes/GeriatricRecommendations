	"description": "Minoru Utsugi, a teenager who was living a peaceful (if boring) life with his sister-in-law, finds his life changed when extraterrestrial contact grants his dearest wish, leaving him with the power of 'The Solitude.' But the ability to realize absolute isolation only plunges Minoru into a battle he never wanted to fight. As his old life comes to an end, he steps into a new role—as the 'Isolator!'>"
