He was just insensitive to people’s feelings.\n\nAfter turning down the offer to be Annette’s teacher, Mariabelle was offered another marriage proposal.\n\nBut when Edward found out about it, he somehow pressured her to get back together with him...\n\n“It’s too late to ask me to get back together now since you broke off our engagement after telling me you had found your true love!”>"
