	"description": "“As of today, you are banned from this guild. You useless piece of baggage.”\n\nAlto was suddenly summoned by Guildmaster and told that he was fired.\n\nHowever, the girl whom he saved from being attacked is a noblewoman and she hires him as a knight.. \n\nI can’t believe I’m getting paid this much!\n\n“What? Only this much for one day of work!”\n\n“What? I have two days off a week?”\n\nUnlike the black guilds that only use up their adventurers, the life of a knight is truly easy.\n\nAlto is convinced that he has become a winner in life.\n\n“He was the heart and soul of this guild! So how dare you fire him! I’m leaving this guild too!”\n\n“You're leaving this guild too! You can’t just leave…”\n\nOn the other hand, the guild members who were angered by Alto’s firing left one after another.\n\nUnbeknownst to Alto, the guild was on the verge of collapse.>"
