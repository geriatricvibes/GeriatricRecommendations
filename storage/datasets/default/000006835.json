	"description": "The battle for the scholarship was like wildfire. In the entrance of the school director’s office, Lin Yujing and Shen Wan came face to face.\n\nLin Yujing wore a pitiful look, tears threatening to fall. “Classmate Shen, to tell you the truth, I came from the countryside. My family’s poor and I was originally called Lin Cuihua. I was the only one in our Lotus Flower Village to have been able to make it to university. If I don’t get the scholarship this time, I won’t be able to pay off the school fees. If I can’t pay off the school fees, I can only go back to my village and feed the pigs….”\n\nShen Wan wore a look of indifference and responded, “What a coincidence. I come from the neighboring Lotus Leaf Village. My original name’s Shen Tiezhu. I don’t only have to feed the pigs; I even have to farm.”\n\nLin Yujing: “…..”\n\nThe two people stared at each other for three seconds before turning around in unison and leaving.\n\nShen Wan got onto his private helicopter while Lin Yujing climbed into her Rolls-Royce.\n\n–This is a story of two rich people trying their best to look poor in front of the other.>"
