Indeed, this is the proper way to choose one’s partner!\n\nMiss Sentinel turns around, a flirtatious gaze dancing on her face as she said with a slight smile: \n\n“My name is Kristen.”\n\nWhat a beautiful name…..wait, isn’t that the exact same name as the arranged partner I’m being forced to marry?!!\n\nThis is a story about a soft hacker princess who is protected and loved within the embrace of her alluring lover. \n\n【”I hope that you can live a life full of happiness without worry.”】>"
