	"description": "The country of Hierbas is ruled jointly by royalty. Princess Beatrice had left the royal palace to spend her time in industrial production in the borderlands. Sandwiched between her haughty older brother Albert and sly younger brother Samuel, she has retreated to avoid the two’s confrontation. But as the situation in the surrounding countries worsens, Beatrice is forced to make a political decision. In her hands, she holds a certain “trump card” she inherited from her grandmother, who was renowned as a wise ruler.\n\nThe books in this series can be read as standalone stories. Each book revolves around a different character.>"
