	"description": "Hashimoto Maya, a weak 22-year-old woman and a pushover,  got herself a kind boyfriend in the form of an android. But there was a mistake so the one that reached her was the “Ore-sama” android…\r\n\r\n*Ore-sama is a way of addressing oneself haughtily. Basically, the android she got is someone who thinks highly of himself; a person with an attitude.>"
