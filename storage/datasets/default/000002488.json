	"description": "Before the people, they use their lips as spears and their tongues as swords.\n\nIn private, though, their lips and teeth are interlocked.\n\nSecond Persona Official Weibo:\n\n“When a variety program has a 'xiangsheng' actor and a well-known presenter swap their jobs with one another, what spark will arise from the meeting of their  ‘violent mouths’? @ZhouChenYu @YanZhao”\n\nYan Zhao: That xiangsheng-talking mouth, that crafty, swindling ghost. [Smile]\nZhou Chenyu: In public, lips as spears, tongues as swords. In private, lips and teeth are interlocked. [Shy]\n—\n\nQ: “As an emcee, how do you fry business CP with a xiangsheng actor?”\n\nA: “He will use roasting to let the whole world know that you’re his wifey.”\n\nQ: “As a xiangsheng actor, what’s the consequence of on-stage calling your business partner ‘wifey’ over and over?”\n\nA: “I called and called, then got XXXed by said wifey.”\n\nNote: Xiàngsheng is, in the simplest of terms, a double act comedy. The literal translation would be ‘Crosstalk’. It is usually performed by a duo where the performers banter with each other. There is usually singing and acting included.>"
