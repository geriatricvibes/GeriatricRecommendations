	"description": "The plain office lady Suzu has fallen into a one-sided love with the kinder than anyone, super-handsome Chief Serizawa. Popular among the female staff, he’s nicknamed Prince Serizawa.\r\n\r\nThough she had decided to mind her own social position by ending it with just longing, one day during overtime she witnesses Serizawa’s outrageous behavior.\r\n\r\nAn odd love comedy about a good natured OL trying to draw back and a yandere boss who will absolutely not let her go.>"
