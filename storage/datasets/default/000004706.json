	"description": "To pay off his father's debts, the cold and aloof actor, Tu Yan, was sold to the second young master of the wealthy and powerful Gu family. This alpha, who has a physical disability, may seem gentle and warm, but Tu Yan is persistent in stepping all over him like dirt under his shoes. Filled with resentment for how his life has become, Tu Yan wanted this second young master to sign a divorce agreement everyday. \n\nOn the other hand, although it was a contractual marriage, Gu Chenbai felt that it was love at first sight.\n>"
