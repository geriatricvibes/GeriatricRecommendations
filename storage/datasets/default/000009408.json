	"description": "In order to prevent the resurrection of the Demon King, high school students, Tsumugi and his friends were summoned to another world with their class.\r\n\r\nThey were told that in this world, there is a friend function called [Bonds-list], and by making a contract with others, their status will increase.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Tsumugi makes a contract - for some reason, his status drops.\r\n\r\nThe ability given to him is [bond-eating], a meaningless one with no known effect.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half months later, Tsumugi left the royal castle and was as a lone adventurer, but he bought a slave that he needed to take the guild's rank advancement test.\r\n\r\nThat slave was a monster girl worth only 30 silver coins.>"
