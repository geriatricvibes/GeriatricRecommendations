	"description": "I was betrayed by my lover and even lost my child, so I was given a second chance.\r\n\r\n‘I’ll pay back everything.’\r\n\r\nI will send my deceitful lover and his mistress into the deepest hell.\r\n\r\nMy kind husband, who foolishly put up with me even though I only took advantage of him. I will only let him walk on a flowery path.\r\n\r\nWhen did it start?\r\n\r\nWhen did everything start to get messed up?\r\n\r\n“Please, be happy with your loved one.”\r\n\r\n“Wife, are you saying that you want me to meet another woman?”\r\n\r\n“Queen, I won’t say I like you anymore, so don’t run away from me.”\r\n\r\nEven the greatest assassin in the empire, who only cares about his interest, was clinging into me.\r\n\r\n‘What’s wrong with everyone! I want to run away to another country and lead a peaceful life!’\r\n\r\nWill I be able to escape safely?>"
