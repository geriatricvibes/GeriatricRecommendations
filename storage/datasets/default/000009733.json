	"description": "Mitsuba was forced to enter a special school exclusive to those that could wield magic. The days that passed by were simply hell. Riduculed and excluded from the outset by her classmates, abused by the handsome delinquent she was forcibly paired with, and disliked unreasonably by her homeroom teacher. Her only friend, a stray cat. To top it all off, someone pushes her down the stairs causing her to die. \r\n----'If I'm going to experience this much hardship, I should have lived my life more freely.' \r\nWhen she thought that, the cat, who was apparently an angel, suddenly speaks: 'I'm sure you'll be happy to hear this. I'll give you six more months to live. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.' \r\nAnd. Then, with six months to live, Mitsuba reopened her eyes and started living her life as she pleased!\r\n----'This time, for the next six months, I will live with no regrets.' \r\nThis is the story of a girl who decided to do so.>"
