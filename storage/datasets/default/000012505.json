	"description": "Yet another tale of a girl who is 'unable to cry' and a boy who is 'unable to laugh'.\r\n\r\nChise was shocked to hear about the divorce of her parents.\r\n\r\nWith her bright smile, she had barely managed to keep together her family that was on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it would've been better if she had just honestly cried and told them she wanted the three of them to be together...\r\n\r\nRiku worked part-time as a newspaper delivery boy.\r\n\r\nHis mother was always away, absent, thus it was essential that he worked to pay his living expenses.\r\n\r\nAll he wished for was to keep drawing, however that wish of his didn't come true either.\r\n\r\nAnd although he never really hated or detested any of that, he couldn't remember when or if he had smiled before...\r\n\r\nNow, their paths cross in this tale of one heartrending and fragile summer.>"
