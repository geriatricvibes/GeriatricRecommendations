	"description": "Because modern-day Zero accidentally transported himself to a foreign world, the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a giant slave ship and he became the ship’s new slave. This was a place where the strong ate the weak. As a new slave, he would have to face his slave master and additionally get bullied by others. The most unthinkable thing was that creatures known as vampires existed.>"
