	"description": "Deep sunken cheeks, dirty skin which lost its original color, twig-like wrists, filthy fingernails and a much smaller body for her age.\r\n\r\nAnd with neglected hair hanging over half of her face, this small child is actually the forgotten Royal Princess of the Empire.\r\n\r\nUnable to stifle her hunger any longer, she crawls out of her hiding within a tiny, old, worn-down castle in search of food...\r\n\r\n'I'm hungry...'\r\n\r\nThe small girl who's wearing nothing but shabby clothes murmured without even realizing.\r\n\r\n'Can I eat this...?'\r\n\r\nHer small fern-like hand tore a piece of vegetation off of the ground, but she eventually put it down while shaking her head from side to side. The little girl hadn't had a proper meal for three days...\r\n\r\n'Estrella...'\r\n\r\nThe child recited the name, her words one with the wind. It was a precious name that she had earned only after a long time.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry I'm late.'\r\n\r\n'...It's alright.'\r\n\r\nThe little one who replied then slumped onto Aelias' chest.>"
