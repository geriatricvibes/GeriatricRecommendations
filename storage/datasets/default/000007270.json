	"description": "Chen Zhao can summon demons and see Death.\n\n“Beelzebub, use your Gluttony ability to treat this patient’s anorexia.”\n\n“Raymond, this old man wants to regain his manly function. You know what I mean.”\n\n“Blackie, tell me honestly, when and how is this person going to die... What? You don’t know? You’re the Grim Reaper!”\n\n“That lady wants bigger breasts, a prettier face, and a slimmer body. Wait... I don’t have any demons with these subordinate abilities yet. Seems like I need to make another trip to Hell.”\n\n>"
