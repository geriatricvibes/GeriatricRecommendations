	"description": "When humans step into the Galactic Era, the ancient art of cultivation thrives once again.\n\nRegardless of the time, cultivation is never obsolete. In the Vajracchedika-prajna-paramita Sutra (a Buddhist scripture), Subhuti (expounder of emptiness) asked Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism,\n\n“How does one control his heart to become a buddha?”\n\nThis one sentence reveals the essence of cultivation: mastery over one’s heart.\n\nThe heart is very powerful, which is the reason why the Monkey King is also called the ‘Heart Monkey’. Everyone’s heart is like a Monkey King; mastering the monkey, one can become something else.\n\nAllow me to demonstrate to you the essence of cultivation.>"
