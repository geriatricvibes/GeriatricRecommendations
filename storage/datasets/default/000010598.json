	"description": "Tang Yuan suffered from a strange illness, so because of this, Tang Yuan pounced upon Xie Yu. A month later, Tang Yuan discovered that Xie Yu was a big shot in the world of tianshi (Taoist Masters), his existence the greatest fear of numerous ghosts. But that big shot was now obligated to marry him, because he was carrying the big shot’s steamed bun.\n\nOne year later:\n\nXie Yu: “Isn’t it time for our pup to be born?”\n\nTwo years later:\n\nXie Yu: “Don’t worry about it. Maybe you’re carrying a nezha (protection deity who was carried for 3.5 years in mother’s womb)?”\n\nThree years later:\n\nXie Yu: “You really are probably carrying a nezha!”\n\nTen Years later:\n\nXie Yu: “Shall we not just give birth to this child? Since he’s obviously not ready, let’s beat him up!”\n\nPup: “I will remember this animosity for the rest of my life!”\n\nAfter being carried for ten years and one month, the steamed bun was finally born. The steamed bun was white and tender at birth, extremely loveable. But on just his first day after being born, the steamed bun kicked his father, Xie Yu, in the face with his tender foot.>"
