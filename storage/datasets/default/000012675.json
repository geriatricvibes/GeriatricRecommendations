	"description": "I, Ogata Yuuto was just your normal everyday high school student who happened to get summoned to another world, along with my classmate Hijiri Yoichi. \r\n\r\nLilia, the girl who summoned us said her world was in danger, and so she summoned a Hero from another world. But incidentally there’s only supposed to be one Hero, and it seems the person with the most magical power is the Hero. After examining Yoichi, he was deemed to be the true Hero.\r\n\r\nAnd just when I was thinking about what I was going to do, Lilia throws me out into a world I have no clue about.  I wasn’t the Hero, so I get treated just like dirt.\r\n\r\nBut when I take a look at my status screen, there’s Hero written in the title section.  That’s strange.   I thought my magic power was supposed to be crappy.  What’s this?  When I looked at my status carefully, there was a hidden section right there!\r\n\r\nBut since I’m the actual Hero, can I really go back home?>"
