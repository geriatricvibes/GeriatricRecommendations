	"description": "Vivian, the Empire’s only spiritualist.\n\nShe had an intimate relationship with a man who appeared in her dreams, while she was studying the art of spiritualism abroad for three years.\n\nShe thought she’d bid goodbye to her dream partner after she returned home.\n\n“Ah, Father. The man behind His Majesty… Who is that?”\n\n“Who are you talking about? Ah, did you mean Lord Orpheus?”\n\n“What? Oh, Lord Orpheus?”\n\nSir Roger Orpheus, the “mad dog” she had heard of?\n\nWhat should she do if they meet again?\n\nNo way, they won’t be able to meet again.\n\nBut, as if to laugh at Vivian’s delusional thoughts, the two slowly became tangled with one another.\n\n“Are you alright, Young Lady?”\n\n“Oh….”\n\n“…I think I’m in trouble.”\n\nEven in real life,\n\n“You know how to use honorifics while calling out, don’t you?”\n\n“Ah, Roger, slow down…”\n\n“Don’t say my name for a bit. If I listen to it now, I’ll go crazy.’\n\nEven in her dreams.>"
