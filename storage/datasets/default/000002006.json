	"description": "Park Yul got transported to the world of a novel.\r\n\r\nWell, sure. He has read a lot of fantasy novels so far, so he was not surprisingly intolerant of such a thing. Live a little, get transported into a novel! And then come back! That's how to live, isn't it?\r\n\r\nBut, why did he possess the cotton doll given to the character who would become the insane, obsessive male lead in the future?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“Levi, the doll you gave me seems to be moving.”\r\n“What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\nYul endured the gaze of the Archduke who was staring at him.\r\n'Be patient, be patient. If you even breathe now, you will be fucked.'\r\n\r\n'Hmm. Yes, it must be my imagination.”\r\n\r\nThe Archduke then turned around and said flatly.\r\nYul lived. He had survived such a miserable life, and today too.\r\n\r\n“Levi.”\r\n'Yes.'\r\n“Burn that.”\r\n'What?! Nooo!!!!!!!!!'\r\n\r\nAs he screamed out in a panic, surprised eyes turned to him.\r\n'Oh, I'm fucked.'>"
