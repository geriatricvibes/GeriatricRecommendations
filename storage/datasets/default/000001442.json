	"description": "Shin Hayul was a genius mage who found out he could not be implanted with Artificial Intelligence, the culmination of modern magic technology.\r\n\r\nThis news was essentially a death sentence for his life as a mage, but that was when a book appeared.\r\n\r\n“To my successor who has the same constitution as me and can hear this voice, I, Ray Vell Bytenor, shall leave this book for you.”\r\n\r\nWith the book left behind by the legendary archmage, the genius's life was put back on track towards greatness.>"
