	"description": "Fay wasn’t evil by nature, she was just unlucky. She fell into the trap of an evil woman. She could have lived well if there was someone to protect her and teach her righteousness from her evil.\n\nThe god of reincarnation wanted to save her but her soul was already tainted, only reversing time could give her one more chance. The god of time lent a helping hand, but … something went wrong.>"
