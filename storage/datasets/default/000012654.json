	"description": "During my graduation, my two-timing boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend. The seven years of affection and friendship was shattered in an instant.\n\nI was thrown into a panic, but my heart was full of hatred.\n\nLuo Xiangdong appeared at this time. The superior him took pity on me.\n\nHe asked, “Liang Zijin, are you that in need of men?”\n\nBecause of money, I became a bar girl that smiled obsequiously. He then asked, “Liang Zijin, you want money instead of your dignity?”\n\nHe showed me the pleasures of the world, feasting and revelry. I took care of the crowd of young beauties that surrounded him.\n\nHe is outwardly kind but inwardly he was evil and cold. He said, “Liang Zijin, get out of my sight.”\n\nBut he hugged me the moment I turned around.\n\nI got used to his coldness, but I couldn’t resist being moved.\n\nWith all my courage, I promised him my love and time.\n\nHe gave me to other men, and said: “From now on, you can call me uncle.”\n\nIn the end, I finally understood that true love is more depreciable than adultery and family affection.>"
