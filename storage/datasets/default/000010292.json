	"description": "Bad bamboo bore good bamboo shoots, and there was only one supporting male character that Xu Ziyu liked in the scumbag attack novel he had been reading. \r\n\r\nJust as he was thinking 'such a good man should let me love him well!', the author killed the stunning man off!\r\n\r\nXu Ziyu slapped the table, throwing the mouse away as he jumped to his feet, before suddenly crossing into the novel in the very next second. Other than this chance to save his beloved character, what else could he wish for?\r\n\r\nXu Shao: This is God's helping hand! My little XuanXuan, here I come!>"
