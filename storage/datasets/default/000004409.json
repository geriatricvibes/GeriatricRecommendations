	"description": "GunGun, as a national treasure(panda), was stolen by thieves and skinned. Once he woke up, he had a healthy body and lots of bamboo leaves. But monsters with glowing eyes surrounded him, most importantly they were floating, have greenish blue faces, fangs, and have no little legs?!\n\n(⊙o⊙) Oh, the two-legged monster is here again, huh, is this bowl of food for him? These tender leaves are delicious, they should be hidden in the deepest part of the den.\n\nThere was an extra panda cub in the Interstellar Admiral’s embrace which he brought everywhere he goes. The place where a gun was once placed turned into a place for holding a basket full of leaves.\n\nOne day, GunGun became a beautiful boy.\n\nPouting face GunGun: Big monster I’m hungry. Huh? Where’s my fur!\n\nThe admiral’s face flushed crimson red being overwhelmed by its cuteness: “!!!!!” My darling!>"
