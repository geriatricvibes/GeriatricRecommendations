	"description": "A god of a different world had abruptly appeared in my classroom and semi-forcibly summoned the entire class to his world.ーーーーexcept for me, Kamiya Yato.\r\n\r\nBecause I was taking a seat in the corner of the class, the round summoning magic circle didn’t reach me and I ended up staying here on earth but with new skills. After I made it through a whole year full of police interviews and journalism reports, I finally graduated to my first year of high school.>"
