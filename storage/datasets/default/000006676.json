	"description": "I am the best when it comes to taking divergent paths. With just a flip of my hand, I shall take the path less commonly travelled. I search far and wide, only to find myself unbeatable and unrivaled. So now I ask, who else can match my awesomeness?\r\n\r\nActing tough is second nature to me and I am a lone wolf.\r\n\r\nThe road is long and winding but I shan’t feel lonely as long as I am able to act tough!\r\n\r\n\r\nLife and death bore me and I do whatever I deem fit.\r\n\r\n“Young man, way back when I started acting tough, you were still learning how to put on your underpants!” Xu Que thus decided to take the path of acting tough. He decided to act tough every single god-damned day. If he wasn’t acting tough, he was scheming for the best way to act tough! >"
