	"description": "In her third life, she was reborn as the only daughter of a villain that didn’t have blood nor tears.\r\nPeople lived in a house that was on the verge of collapsing, so she designed a building using her previous life’s knowledge.\r\nHowever, her dad caught her and—\r\n\r\n“We passed a bill that the building’s ownership would be given to the person who organized the building’s construction.”\r\n\r\nShe became the owner of a large building.\r\n\r\nLet’s just get some slush funds and retire!\r\n\r\n“The lady kept me from getting hungry!”\r\n“I can sleep in a warm, new house thanks to milady!”\r\n“Everyone’s youth employment rate rose sharply!”\r\n\r\nWhat did I do? Is it such a big deal that everyone had to praise me this much? To make things worse, my father found out about my plan to flee from home…….\r\n\r\n“What did I do wrong? I’ll fix everything, so don’t leave.”\r\n“T-That’s not it…….”\r\n“I’ll give you anything you want. Oh, right, didn’t the emperor’s son bother you? I can also cut the emperor’s neck, what do you think?”\r\n\r\nThen, like a bolt from the blue, he thought of starting a war.\r\n\r\n‘Why do I keep getting more work?’\r\n\r\n…C-Can I retire safely?>"
