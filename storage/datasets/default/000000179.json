	"description": "Boundless gold sea of sand, snow-white Tian Shan camel. I am clothed in a green silk dress, eyes bright, with a faint smile. The prayers of a thousand mountains and a million water drops are not for company today, but for a reunion in the next life…\n\nShe is the wolf girl’s daughter, Huo Qu Bing’s precious treasure, the green silk dress in the desert, and the Ju Gong Zi of Chang An city.\n\nHe is the deep, far-sighted Han Zhao Emperor of the Western Han Dynasty.\n\nHe is the clever and mysterious Meng fox.\n\nWhen each of them unintentionally give away a pearl embroidered shoe in youthful ignorance, what kind of love-hate-passion-vengeance “Song in the Clouds” will be stirred into existence?>"
