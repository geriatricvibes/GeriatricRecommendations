	"description": "A nameless mercenary who died on the battlefield opens his eyes and finds himself wrapped in light brown fur!!\n\n“Wa, wafi? Kuuaoon!?” Wh-what? I can’t speak!?\n\nReincarnated as a “Kobold”, a humanoid, dog-type beast, he challenges this absurdity head-on and leads the weakest dog race with a 10-year life expectancy, to climb the ladder of evolution, one day at a time!!\n\nAnd, as he aims to grow from the weakest to the strongest, there is also a chance for him to evolve and turn into a werewolf, or stay as a Kobold and do as he pleases, but he will stay fluffy for now.>"
