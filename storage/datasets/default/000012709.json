In interrogation the female knight Ilias met at the imprisoned place, when talking about the bandits seen in the mountain, Illias, who was stuck in the search for said bandits, hurriedly strikes the bandits . My wish to be a Hero, or to build a harem?\r\n\r\n“I just want to live in a safe place” – a story that such a man survives the different world with “Understanding” as a weapon!>"
