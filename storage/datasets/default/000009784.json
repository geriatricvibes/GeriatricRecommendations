	"description": "Jiang Xiaoli woke up in the middle of the night from wanting to pee, and as she opened the bathroom door, she entered the horror escape game.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, when people are unlucky, they are unlucky in everything.\r\n\r\nJiang Xiaoli carefully and painstakingly survived the Beginner’s Game, and the other players were either given Taomu Sword, Zhen Gui Banner and other magical weapons, which are all powerful in the Escape Game!\r\n\r\nBut what did she get? A female ghost in red dress!\r\n\r\nA red-dressed ghost who had a thing for her, living on her heart?\r\n\r\nJiang Xiaoli: (smile.jpg) Whenever this dead ghost is angry, my heart hurts. Seriously – I mean physical heartache.\r\n\r\nHowever after a few Games….\r\n\r\nJiang Xiaoli: I’m at peace. (peaceful.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd then later…..\r\n\r\nJiang Xiaoli: Maybe this is more than physical heartache…..\r\n\r\nLi Hongying: ?\r\n\r\nCrazy Maniac in red vs. Silly and sweet little white girl.\r\n\r\n[Some of the Games are “Referenced” from real events.]>"
