	"description": "Rieze, the daughter of a knight, was in love with Alexis, her childhood friend and heir of the margrave. However, she already accepted that it was a futile love, given the difference in their status.\n\nTragedy struck, however. The margave was killed after being attacked, and Alexis inherited the title. Unfortunately, Alexis had fallen into depression due to the trauma that he sustained when his father was slain right in front of him.\n\nAll the candidates for the position of his fiancee fled, and Rieze was chosen. She was finally married to her first love, but Alexis avoided her, and their marriage was void of love.\n\nOne day, Rieze tried to stop Alexis, who had become battle crazy, but he slashed her, instantly killing her —\n\nRieze opened her eyes — she had returned into the past.\n\nBanking on the premise that the future would change and no one would be miserable if she managed to prevent the attack, Rieze decided to capture the culprits beforehand, and she succeeded.\n\nAlexis and the others were safe now. She thought it would be nice if she faded out of the picture once he got married…but Alexis’ proposal and his doting awaited her!?\n\nAnd besides, it seemed that Alexis loved Rieze ever since they were children….?\n\nThis wasn’t supposed to happen, but… in this case, she would definitely live her second life to the fullest!>"
