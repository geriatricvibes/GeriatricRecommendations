	"description": "I passed through some people’s worlds, while some people passed through my world.\n\nWe used to want to be a part of someone’s world, but it turned out that we just the passers-by.\n\nSometimes if you just stood in situ, carefully guarding each memory, you usually would find the one you had been waiting for was gone for good.\n\nI wanted to tell you: sit down, have a drink, enjoy the scenery, and then move on. The world belonging to you was right ahead, in the name of happiness.>"
