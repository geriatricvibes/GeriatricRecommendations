	"description": "She has chosen a path that is different from that of the ordinary person and she has also fallen in love with a man who is different from that of ten thousand other. Thus even she is covered in bruises, her heart filled with reassurances. Pain radiates from the bottom of her heart, but happiness also brims from the bottom of her heart, causing the secluded Butterfly Killer from the masked gang of killers to emerge……\n\nDarkness is everywhere. To get to the bottom of this painful investigation, he must leave to uncover the illusions behind the darkness. Justice is like the cold rocks in a deep abyss beneath the great moon. Yet the clear light has always existed in the dark. If he finally comes, please close your two tearful eyes in the depths of the night forevermore.>"
