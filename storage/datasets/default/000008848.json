I’ll survive thoroughly and live a long life!”\n\nI’ve been reincarnated as the younger sister of my favorite novel character who is destined to be poisoned by her step-mother at the age of seventeen.\n\nMy brother is on an adventure with the heroine so I have to survive by myself. Should we start with survival plans?\n\nFirst, be sure to behave myself around my step-mother and step-sister.\n\nSecondly, become close with children of influential families.\n\nThird, is… umh… getting married?\n\nTo escape the fate of a miserable death,\n\nI, Adriana, begin to approach the Prince of the Empire, the suspicious Master, and the suspicious Demon!>"
