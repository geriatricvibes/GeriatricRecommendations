	"description": "Young master Shao is three parts OCD, three parts shameless and four parts cheap but in front of outsiders, he is always distant and carefree, he stood aloof from the world. In his proud and aloofness is indifference, in his indifference is detachment and in his detachment is elegance.\n\nIt’s just that after he returned home, he would enter into his ‘high’ mode–\n\n“Shower, shower, shower. Qing Xi, do you want to come and ravage me ah?”\n\nQing Xi always thought, can this person be any more vulgar?\n\nOr else it was– “Wife, hurry up and cook for me, it’s a legal requirement ah!”\n\n“Woman, let’s watch a movie tonight, it’s a legal requirement oh!”\n\n“Qing Xi, that, let’s eat! It’s a marriage legal legal legal requirement oh!”\n\nEvery time, ‘student’ Qing Xi could not restrain from an urge to illegally dispose of him.\n\nWhat is happiness, happiness is 13 years ago, every time primary school ended, there would be a boy running in front of you to walk in a ‘S’ shape. 13 years later, it is still this same man that holds you in his arms, vulgarly telling you, “my youth was consumed by you, you must, must take responsibility for me ah!”>"
