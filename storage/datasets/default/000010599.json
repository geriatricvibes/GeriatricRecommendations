	"description": "Tang Yuan found himself pregnant.\n\nIn order to avoid being harassed by his family because of his unmarried pregnancy, young master Tang, who had not chased others since childhood, had to make a plan——\n\nTo capture the most popular diamond king in B city, Jiang Huaizhi, the beast who made him pregnant!\n\nAnd two months later, Tang Yuan began to doubt whether Jiang Huaizhi was indifferent.\n\nYoung master Tang angrily threw the hospital laboratory test sheet on the desk. He pulled the man’s tie and pressed forward, step by step, with a fierce look in his eye.\n\n“I am carrying your child. What do you want to do? Say it! If you can’t say something, or don’t want to, I’ll leave today!”\n\nJiang Huaizhi pulled him out of the room by his hand and said with a smile, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to get married.”\n\n“!!” Wait? So fast?? Hold on a second!!>"
