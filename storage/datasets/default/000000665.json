	"description": "Xiao Xiang Zi, a cloud spirit in heaven, and Chu Kong mess up the red strings of fate by accident during their brawl.\n\n As a consequence, they are sentenced to be a fated couple in the mortal realm for 7 lifetimes as a punishment for not getting along with each other.\n\nHowever, Xiang Zi sneakily reincarnates without erasing her memory, and unlike Chu Kong, she retains awareness and uses it to her advantage.>"
