	"description": "Within the demon race, there was a notorious demon who was known as the demon king and he suddenly disappeared one day. When Xie Yan went downstairs to throw out the tr*sh, he found a half-dead silver gradient cat lying next to the tr*sh can. Perhaps due to fate, the kitten followed him home and he decided to take it in. Soon after, Xie Yan realised that the cat was intelligent and had a spiritual consciousness, but it had a bad temper and didn’t allow Xie Yan to touch it.\n\nHe cared for the kitten tenderly for more than half a month. As a result, the kitten jumped out the window and ran away while he was sleeping. Before he could find his cat, he met Ji Qinghuai by chance. It was the first time they met but for some reason, he felt an odd sense of familiarity.\n\nJi Qinghuai seemed to know his living habits and other things that no one else would know. There were many indications that there was something odd about Ji Qinghuai, so he was wary of this person. However, when he found his cat’s bell with Ji Qinghuai, Ji Qinghuai could no longer hide.\n\nXie Yan stopped Ji Qinghuai and asked, “Young master Ji, you abducted my cat. Shouldn’t you give me an explanation?”>"
