	"description": "I was an average salaryman when a pre-marital checkup revealed that I was infertile, and my engagement was called off. I was perplexed by the situation, but a few years later I was transferred to another world for some reason.\n\nThere are beastmen and second gender in this in this foreign world, where even a man can become pregnant. Later on, I took a test and discovered I could have a child because I was an omega. I evolved into a cheerful individual.\n\nHowever, perhaps it was because I have lived as a heterosexual for 30 years in previous world, I became reluctant to be embraced by a man. Still, I wanted to have a child, so I got drunk and met a beautiful beastman who arouses me, and we ended up having a one-night stand.\n\nBut, the next morning, I decided to run away.>"
