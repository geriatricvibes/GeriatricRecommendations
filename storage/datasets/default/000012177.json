	"description": "Feeling hopeless in a cold-hearted society, I arrived in a different dimension, Altius Empire!\n\nIt’s the first oracle in 32 years and there’s nothing I can do to meet the expectations of the Empire’s citizens. There’s nothing different in this world.\n\nThe cold treatment is no different from the previous world.\n\nAfter a series of disappointments swept through, what came after was fatigue and lethargy.\n\nI don’t want to do anything.\n\nI’m not doing anything but I don’t want to do anything more intensely.\n\nEven so…..\n\n“What did you do all day long today?”\n\nDid he come here to criticize my guts with biting remarks?\n\nA language bomber with 10000 levels of shaming mental offense, Emperor Mikhail Dnar Altius.\n\nWhy does he come to my room every day with a fresh look on his face?\n\nWhat’s this familiarity?\n\nPardon me, but are you my mother?\n\nHa, I’m not fond of the Emperor.>"
