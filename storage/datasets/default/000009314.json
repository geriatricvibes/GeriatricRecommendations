	"description": "I was a former delinquent, but when I entered high school I got serious.\n\nMy grades aren’t good, but my behaviour is adequate. I have 0 friends because of my face and a rumour.\n\nOne day, I received a nutritional supplement drink from my younger sister, so I drank it at school.\n\nThen, my body changed, my chest swelled up, and my butt became big. My waist became thinner, my shoulder width got narrower and my hair grew. Also my height shrank?\n\nThis looks like a girl… does it not?\n\nHow did this happen…\n\nIs this seriously a story about a stupid girl?>"
