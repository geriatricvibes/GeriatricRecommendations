	"description": "That year, when the plane soared to thousand miles in the sky, Xu Ai cried like no tomorrow at the airport and since then lost her innocent love. \r\n\r\nThis scene broke into the sight of the people watching sceneries as they waited in the lounge. \r\n\r\nThen, on the first day of college, she met Lin Shen, who became the knot in her heart for the next three years, robbing her a place to rest her love during the best time in her youth. \r\n\r\nShe originally thought that she no longer had the strength to love someone anymore, until Su Xuan's appearance. \r\n\r\nHe came with warmth and sunshine, driving away the haze for her, creating great ambiance of youth and love.>"
