	"description": "Raine is a normal student in St. Petersburg Joseph Academy, but one day she was summoned to the Principal’s Office and was informed that she was expelled from the school. She also learned that she’ll be transferred to a strange school in the middle of the forest, so she did not feel secure. But because of this transfer, she would enter a world that is very different from what she is used to. A world where she can discover her true identity and the world where she really belongs to.>"
