As a result of great effort, his test ranking rose and while he was satisfied with his loner life,\r\n\r\n– Hi-hi-hi… Virgin, teach me agaain♪\r\n\r\n– Shut up, bitch. Let’s finish it quick today, OK?\r\n\r\n– Yay!\r\n\r\nOne day, it was decided that he will help blonde gyaru Tachibana Karen, central figure of the class, with her studies. Loner during lunch break, tête-à-tête studying after school… So continues the double life.\r\n\r\nTsundere-like, but good at taking care of people Ichijou-kun.\r\n\r\nA bit mischievous Tachibana-san with an innocent smile.\r\n\r\nWith this and that happening, the two get along so well that others cringe.>"
