	"description": "Just now, I stole the lips of a man who is notorious as a tyrant. \r\n\r\nIn front of my younger cousin, Arinel, who stole everything I had in my previous life.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“Why did you kiss me?”\r\n\r\n“Because my younger cousin loves you, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?”\r\n\r\nHis arms wrapped around my waist. The distance that was formed vanished in an instance. The cold-blooded, powerful man’s smile filled my view. \r\n\r\n“Open your lips. If you are going to do it, then do it properly.”>"
