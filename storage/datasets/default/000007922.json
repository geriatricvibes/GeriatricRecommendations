	"description": "Lu Lin resigned from his job in the big city, returned to the countryside, and inherited the convenience mart left by his parents. Then a thunderstorm sent Lu Lin to an unfamiliar ancient era. Lu Lin was reborn as a young man with the same name and surname as himself, and he was about to be married to a fierce Bio who goes up the mountain to fight tigers. \r\n\r\nAdjusting to ordinary farming, not a long story.\r\n\r\nNote: In this story, 'Bios' typically have manly features and a birthmark shaped like a flower on their forehead. They are not as tall as men and they are able to bear children, but childbirth is more difficult than it is for women.>"
