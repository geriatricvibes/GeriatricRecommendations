	"description": "Forcefully brought over from the modern world to an alternate world, Wang Chong felt detached and lived his life aimlessly.\n\nHowever, when calamity struck and he saw his family and everything he cared for being torn apart, he felt regret.\n\nThus, he stood up and eventually became the Grand Marshal of the Central Plains, leading an army against those who sought to destroy all he cherished.\n\nYet, despite all his efforts, it was already too late to reverse destiny.\n\nBut before his death, a shooting star, the same one which brought him to this world, appeared before him, and he was given another chance to undo his regrets.>"
