	"description": "When the curtain falls on the stage, I will take my stand as the Queen.\r\n\r\nReadymade Queen Act I: Salvation and deception\r\n\r\nA splendid world under the blazing sun, a quarrel over its true ownership.\r\n\r\nThe play began in the shadows, where no-one bothered to look.\r\n\r\n“Your hair…it’s auburn. Even your eyes…the same color as the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nVioletta, the Princess who had been bound by the title of a fool, was murdered.\r\n\r\nThe only person who had witnessed the end of her vain life, as her lady-in-waiting, was the fallen aristocrat Abigail.\r\n\r\nAbigail predicted a preventable end for herself as well.\r\n\r\nUntil the Duke said;\r\n\r\n“You have to be the Princess.”>"
