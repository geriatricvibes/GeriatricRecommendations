Evelina, who despises both the prince and the saint, plots to assassinate the saint, but the plan fails and Evelina is arrested.\r\n\r\nEvelina was supposed to be executed, but she was never executed. Sylas, her butler, came forward and claimed to be the true culprit. Evelina, who was filled with remorse after learning that Sylas had taken her place, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nHowever, when she awakens, she is in the royal palace on the day of the annulment. Evelina returns to the past and decides to live in her second life solely to make Sylas happy, without holding grudges against anyone.>"
