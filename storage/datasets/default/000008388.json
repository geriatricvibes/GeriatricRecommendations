However, no one knew that his Martial Spirit was the Life Martial Spirit, one of the 10 Great Martial Spirits of the ancient times.\n\nAfter being upgraded, the Life Martial Spirit is able to absorb all Heaven and Earth Essence Qi, as well as heal injuries and neutralise extreme poisons. With the Heaven-Devouring Divine Art left behind by his father, Xiao Yun integrates many more Martial Spirits for himself to use.\n\nA hopeless youth defies fate and washes away his humiliation, walking towards the boundless world with his Life Martial Spirit to become an eternal martial sovereign, dominating the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths!>"
