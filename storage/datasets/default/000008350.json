	"description": "One day, a small account appeared under a certain big V Weibo. “Asking the netizens how to chase a man. He doesn’t lack money or a car. I am also a man. I look like a nine-pointer. Waiting online. Please answer quickly.”\n\nSomeone replied: “Nine points? Does the master think he is Lu Yan?' Lu Yan, who was inexplicably stunned by his fans, shut down the trumpet silently. A few months later, the new generation national husband Mr. Gu suddenly posted a Weibo. “You have a bad dog in your heart, don’t come close.”>"
