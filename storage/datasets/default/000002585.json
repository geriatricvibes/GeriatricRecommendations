	"description": "My name is Liu Ming, and I’m about to start my college life soon. I thought that my life would be like most common people: you enter college, graduate, and then find a nice job, get married, and then grow older and older. . . But, that morning, everything changed. . . My name is Liu Ming, and I’m about to start my college life soon. I am just wondering why we should have a dinner upon graduation since primary school. . . My name is Liu Ming, and I’m about to start my college life soon. I saved a girl from her game and her ex’s harassment. Later, I was dragged by my friend to our class’s dinner upon graduation and met her, surprisingly, in the restaurant. I had thought that this was a good meeting for our wonderful relationship, but it turned into a chaotic quarrel and fight between our two classes. . .>"
