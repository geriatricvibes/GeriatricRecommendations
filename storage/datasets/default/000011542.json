	"description": "Yuria was just a fleeting extra in a novel. No one would have even spotted her in the novel itself.\n\nBut all of a sudden, she became the mother of the strongest villain after she accidentally adopted him.\n\nAnd that son…\n\n“Just because you’re my father doesn’t mean you’re my mother’s husband. We’re connected just because of blood. Don’t even think of becoming my mother’s husband.”\n\nHis father didn’t even appear in the novel, but this son of hers grew up so wonderfully that he knew how to threaten his father.>"
