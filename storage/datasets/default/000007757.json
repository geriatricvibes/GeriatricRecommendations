	"description": "A chef found himself resurrected in parallel world. This world is almost similar to his own. Except there was uprising caused by vegetarians nearly 80 years ago, which made it dangerous for people to consume meat. As a result, innumerable vegetarian delicacies appeared and meat based dishes became almost non-existent.\n\nWith the virus gone, the government is trying to reintroduce meat based dishes again. But sadly, many recipes for meat dishes have been lost during the uprising.\n\nArmed with his knowledge as a chef of all kinds of dishes, meat, fish and more, will Chef Ye Chui be able to bring about a revolution in this vegetarian based world?>"
