	"description": "“Do you love me, Sheemon?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, Leila,” he said, looking at her tenderly.\r\n\r\nBut this love was a farce.\r\n\r\nLeila Hessus was betrayed by her own sister and fiancé, the two people she cared most in this world. And when she was at death’s door, soon to die by the hands of her lover, flashes of regret smeared across her face.\r\n\r\nAs she jumped to her, a black shadow appeared.\r\n\r\n“It’s me, Miss Leila.”\r\n\r\nHe held her in her arms tight, careful to not let her go.\r\n\r\n“I’ll protect you. I’ll be your tool for vengeance.”\r\n\r\nWill she be able to live a life without regrets?>"
