	"description": "A NEET who wasn’t rewarded no matter how much effort he put in was reincarnated by Demi-God the moment he encountered a convenience store robber. His NEET life got smashed up unreasonably and one-sidedly. But since the Demi-God said he would grant him any talent he wants, he replied with ‘talent where effort will be blessed and rewarded proportionally’. After receiving [innate talent] and [clairvoyance] from the Demi-God, the NEET will work hard in another world.>"
