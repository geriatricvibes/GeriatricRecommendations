	"description": "Harboring an obsession with the male deuteragonist of the novel series, Held a Flower, Seo Urie was once again binge reading the novel from its beginning until its very end. \r\n[I can't breathe because of Lancelot. While I'm at it, I might as well have him all to myself and take good care of him~ ;A; I seriously need just one Lancelot!! (っ╥︿╥)っ]\r\nAs usual, she left a comment and fell asleep when...\r\n\r\n'It's already morning, Milady.' \r\n\r\nWhy do I feel as if something strange has happened? \r\nWhy's my favorite character here? And why is he calling me 'Milady'? \r\n\r\nI'm quite sure that I've hit a jackpot. Or maybe this is my reward for saving the universe in my past life. If that isn't the case, then there's no way that something like this could've possibly happened, right?  \r\n\r\nSince I've won the lottery, I may as well enjoy it to the fullest. Not to mention, I'm very determined to prioritize my favorite character's happiness over anything else.\r\n\r\n'Lancelot, I've decided to quit.' \r\n'What do you mean by that, Milady?'\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath, then I answered. \r\n'The revenge story.'>"
