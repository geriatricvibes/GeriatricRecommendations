	"description": "Yamashita Yuuto and Watanabe Asahi. They’re childhood friends who live next door to each other. They are so close in school that they’re called the “best couple in the school” and they both love each other.\n\nHowever, Yuuto is unable to get up the courage to confess his love to Asahi because of an incident in his past.\n\nAsahi had no intention of confessing her love to Yuuto in order to keep the promise she made to him in the past.\n\nHowever, one event changes Asahi’s mind.\n\nShe says, “I’ll be more proactive in appealing to Yuuto to get him to confess to me.”\n\nThis is despite the fact that they like each other and are so close that people around them think they are lovers.\n\nThis is the story of two people who are in love with each other but cannot say the words “I love you” even though they are so close that people around them think they are lovers.>"
