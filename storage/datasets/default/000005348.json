	"description": "Being born as an illegitimate daughter of the Duke, Seria was never loved by anyone. Afraid of being abandoned by her own family, she finally finds a way she could be useful. \n\nIt is to seek the interests of the family through a political marriage to the monster prince, Kardi, who is known as the ‘Nightmare of the Battlefield’. However, to Seria, Kardi seemed a little bit different when she met him…\n\n“Do you really need to be a monster’s wife?”\n\nIt was the first time someone cared about her opinion. Perhaps that’s why. That’s why she was happy even when she died for Kardi.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again and realized that their happy memories disappeared like a dream, she decided.\n\n“May I ask the Grand Duke for a dance?”\n\nTo be unashamed of herself as a person, and to be Kardi’s wife once again.>"
