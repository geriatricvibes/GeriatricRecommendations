	"description": "This a sweet love story between a girl and a man who hardly expresses his love through words. This is a step of understanding that love is not just a word but actions. In the beginning the girl had a romantic perception that confession, proposal, and marriage is every woman’s three key moments throughout​ their lives, it should be a tear-jerker moment that even you’re old you can still feel it in your eyes.\n\nAfter several years, when she gained deeper understanding, she said:\n\n”He never said he loves me, but no matter what the problem, as long as I say it, he will definitely solve it.”>"
