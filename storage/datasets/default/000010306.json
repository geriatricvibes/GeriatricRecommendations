	"description": "Han Yang never thought he would one day sell himself into a marriage with another man. He believed his life would be mundane but that man, named HeLian Qing, broke his pre-planned life. Parental debt, a child's compensation, he had no chance whatsoever to resist, he has no ability to resist.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nHe thought this marriage was simply an unwanted one, but soon after he discovered that... his husband's BODY IS MORE HONEST THAN HIS MOUTH. That man was a duplicitous, tsundere to the extreme!\r\nHan Yang: 'Everyday all there is, is my husband's vicious tongue and my weary heart.'>"
