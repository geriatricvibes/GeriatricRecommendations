	"description": "I am a vampire, possessing the body of the villainess in the novel.\n\nI want to live quietly so I can live peacefully.\n\nWhen I saw the Duke of Esteban, I lost all my reason and bit his neck.\n\nDuke of Esteban just so happens to be the greatest figure in the empire.\n\nI didn’t have enough strength to fight the desire, so I slept with him…\n\nI’m in trouble. Let’s erase his memory and run.\n\n“Your Excellency asked me to convey a message ‘I let you have my neck and body, but you threw it all away and ran.’”\n\nWhat are you saying?\n\nDoes he remember?\n\nLater, there was a strange declaration of war after we met.\n\n“Don’t avoid me and let’s continue to meet. Also, when you need blood, come find me.” \n\nDuke, would you please stay away from me?\n\nIt’s hard to breathe because of your taste.>"
