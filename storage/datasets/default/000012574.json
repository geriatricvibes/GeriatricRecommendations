	"description": "Chi Ying transmigrated into a supporting female character who ran off with the bun in a CEO novel.\n\nAccording to the plot, she and her child would become the obstacle between the male and female lead’s relationship. Their story arc would conclude with the destruction of her family.\n\nAs a result, Chi Ying decided to treasure her life and stay away from the male lead.\n\nLater, the male lead cornered her. There was a burning darkness in his eyes, and his knuckles pale.\n\nIn his cold and deep voice, he said, “No more running away from me…”\n\nChi Ying frowned slightly. That’s not… how she remembered the story arc.\n\n—\n\nThe entire country knew that Lu JingYan, CEO of Oushi, was cold, classy, had moral integrity, and never talked to a woman more than it was necessary.\n\nIt was only that he was also handsome, tall, and a living representation of limitless wealth and status.\n\nHis female fans gave him the endearing nickname CEO of the People.\n\nBut one day…\n\nLu JingYan suddenly appeared in a variety show called “Where Did Daddy and Mommy Go?”\n\nPitter-pattering behind him was a mini Lu JingYan.\n\nAudience all over the country: ? ? ? ? ?>"
