	"description": "In our world there are objects that go by the name of 'Relics'. Not antiques or items of classical art, but mysterious things like a stone that brings luck, a doll whose hair grows night after night, or a mirror that shows your future appearance.\r\n\r\nThe world is big and so there happens to be a shop that offers such suspicious items â€” the Tsukumodo Antique Shop (FAKE). But as the name suggests, only fakes can be found there. To make matters worse, the shop assistant is a girl whose attendance couldn't be blunter, so the store hardly has any customers at all. However, from time to time a real Relic appears and makes things interesting.\r\n\r\nVery well, now let us talk about those who have obtained one of these mysterious items.>"
