Let me teach you a lesson!” \r\n\r\nA 24th Century Supreme Vision Master transmigrates to become the incapacitated genius daughter of the Marquis Household in a lower-class country. \r\n\r\nWith a pair of powerful blood-red eyes armed with the ability to appraise treasures, see through things, heal, poison and break through defenses... She is invincible! \r\n\r\nA spirit and martial arts cultivator, an expert in weapons and medicine, a master in controlling beasts and deploying formations... \r\n\r\nShe is the embodiment of the ultimate supremacy and unrivaled arrogance! \r\n\r\nNever does she expect to get involved with a person who is even more wicked than her. From then on, it becomes a game of I-run-you-catch. When you kill someone, I’ll hand you the knife. \r\n\r\nTogether, let’s wreak havoc in the world!>"
