In the vast Divine Lands, at the western border, upon the recommendation of his best friend, he began walking on a path he had never thought possible. The Cloudlink Sect, as the ‘Final Path’ of the 7 main sects of the Divine Lands, on their sacred disciple acceptance ceremony that happens once every 5 years, took in a single 5th generation disciple who had a beggar-like bearing. With the gates of cultivation opened wide for him, will this bright and mischievous child be able to mature into a powerful Immortal that rules the world? >"
