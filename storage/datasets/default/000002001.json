	"description": "2LDK apartment in the Tokyo metropolitan area, for rent with only 30.000 Yen. Crap! I have been lured by the cheap price and made a contract to live in the property. Yeah, as expected it was a shitty property. No Ghost came out but a Slime and a Goblin…. also a Female Knight came out. Although I just want to start a peaceful life alone. A Female Knight, a Mage, and a Thief frequented my room. Dungeons are a dangerous place to conquer by those girls. I spread traps made by the items that were bought from a discount store.>"
