	"description": "A mystical magic formation bestows ships with the power to evolve. In an eerie world, a young man from a fishing village cobbles together a boat with pieces of broken wooden planks, marking the beginning of his journey to greatness… \r\n\r\nThe evolving vessel, is also known as a ‘cursed vessel’… \r\n\r\n(Note: The protagonist began his journey in modern-day Europe in a parallel world, not just some place with a medieval high-fantasy setting.)>"
