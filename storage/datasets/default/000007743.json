	"description": "Hai Ruo (Female Lead): Gentle and affectionate, university professor teaching ancient literature and the history of ancient literature, a spinster, a goddess in most people’s eyes.\n\nChu Chengyu (Male Lead): A cool elite, capital god, cold and hard to approach, but actually longing for the warmth of a family.\n\nBlack cat DongDong (Real? Male Lead): The poor stray cat that was picked up by the female lead (actually the male lead), the whole body jet black, amber eyes, usually cold, in fact becoming dull and cute in a second after being teased.\n\nReally really love you.\n\nReally wish to be together with you forever.\n\nBut there’s no helping it, reborn as a cat, in the end can only——\n\nBe with you for thirteen years.\n\nAll knowledge of raising a cat is the author’s nonsense, some believable and some not, please identify yourself.>"
