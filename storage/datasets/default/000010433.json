Grand Duke Leonhart von Esbaden Halton.\r\n\r\n“As long as you don't lose your dignity as the Duchess of Esbaden, I won’t care about what you decide to do here. '\r\n\r\nContrary to his dazzlingly beautiful face, eyes cold as ice stared at her.\r\n\r\nAs if no matter what happens, he wouldn’t give Dooha his heart. \r\n\r\nYes, this marriage was just for an alliance.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that it would be like this.\r\n\r\n'I should have told you that you’re the only woman in my life.” \r\n\r\nWhen did it begin? His blue eyes contained her alone, filled with ferocious longing .\r\n\r\nDooha came to a realization only when she heard the sound of her heart crazily beating.\r\n\r\nTheir marriage alliance was no longer just an alliance.\r\n\r\n>"
