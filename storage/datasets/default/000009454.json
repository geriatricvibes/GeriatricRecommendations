	"description": "Upon waking up, Ji Yu found that he had transmigrated. Not only had he changed body, but he also got a little cub. \n\nAfter transmigrating, he is at ease. He decides to study hard and work hard to raise the cub. \n\nBut… \n\nWhy does the person named He Zhou kept looking into his eyes so strangely? \n\nWhy does Ji Yu care about him inexplicably? \n\nWhen looking at each other, he can’t help but blushed and feels his heartbeat very fast. \n\nEven more shocking was when the little cub, who was raised and raised,  suddenly turned into a small mutant beast, wailing at his mother. \n\nJi Yu's stomach has also been feeling very wrong, and was bulging day by day. \n\nDoctor: You are pregnant.\n\nJi Yu: …Whose it is?\n\nHe Zhou twisted the cigarette butt and bust in: Mine.>"
