	"description": "“Don’t get the wrong idea, okay. I definitely don’t like people such as you!”\r\n\r\nThis template tsundere phrase marked the beginning of mine and Aotsuki Mifuyuu’s story. Because of her cold and indifferent attitude, she always stands out negatively in class. However one day, we ended up talking more and more with each other, and I started to see the warmth behind her cold words. Why is she so distanced and unaffectionate towards people despite being so kind? That seems to be related to her past that I don’t know about…\r\n\r\nThis is a story about love, telling the coming along of a boy and girl until they finally act affectionate towards each other.\r\n>"
