	"description": "Kanae is a university student whose 'cold beauty' has led people to spread nasty rumors about his promiscuity. In truth, Kanae is a virgin, and is secretly in love with the Don Juan of the campus, Yuuichi. Poor Kanae would do anything to be with Yuuichi, even if it meant a merely sexual relationship with no feelings involved. But when the opportunity arises, can he settle for anything less than love?>"
