	"description": "One day, Elizabeth Barton, a villainous daughter who is a mob, suddenly regains her memory of her previous life and realizes that she has reincarnated in the world of the otome game ‘Royal Lovers’.\n\nElizabeth is dissatisfied with the world of this otome game, where only good-looking guys are given preferential treatment.\n\n“That’s right. I should be the target of the capture.”\n\nThus, the days of aiming for the noble and fabulous capture target of the Duke’s daughter Elizabeth, who will fall in love with the main character, the ‘heroine’, have begun.\n\nA heart-full romantic comedy that the protagonist dresses up as a man, polishes himself, is told by girls, and sometimes for some reason he pushes forward while deepening his ties with other targets.>"
