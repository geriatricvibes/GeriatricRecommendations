	"description": "Su Xingchen inherited a house where a rare spatial overlap occurred inside.\n\nThe person who ‘cohabited’ with him was a young and handsome entrepreneurial elite. This president was very pitiful. Everyday, he didn’t eat well or sleep well, and even had nightmares at night.\n\nSince they happened to live ‘together,’ Su Xingchen also helped the other person cook and clean in passing.\n\nFor example, when eating glutinous rice with chicken for breakfast, he shared some. When eating beef stew and cucumber salad for lunch, he shared some. When eating bitter melon scrambled eggs at night … Oh, don’t like bitter melon? Ok, have pork stir-fry with wood ear mushroom instead!\n\nOne month later, Su Xingchen was pleased to discover that the president had been fattened up by him (don’t you think?)!\n\nHowever, what Su Xingchen thought was a mutually harmonious companionship, somehow turned him into the other person’s ‘white moonlight’ (unattainable love).>"
