	"description": "One day, his roommates were discussing what type of girls were the cutest.\n\nSu Lin didn’t speak a word from beginning to end. He waited for them to finish then snickered disdainfully, “By your standards, slightly pretty and dumb little dwarves are considered cute.”\n\n—\n\nLater, he went to the French department for an elective class and got poked in the back.\n\nTurning around, he saw a little girl.\n\nBig eyes, white skin, pretty and tiny. She looked…. s*upidly cute.\n\nLu Yuanyuan looked at the guy’s handsome face and carefully asked, “Classmate, excuse me, can you let me through?”\n\nThe voice was very small, the tone matching the person, soft and sticky.\n\n….. So f*cking cute.\n\nSu Lin’s heart was about to jump out of his chest.\n\nHe suppressed his emotions and said: “Okay, tell me your name first.”>"
