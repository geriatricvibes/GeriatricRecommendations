Due to their relationship as debtor and debtee, the two become closer to each other. Lin Xichi could always act without any reservations around Xu Fang because they are childhood friends.\n\nWhen she was in high school, Lin Xichi who used to be bright and cheery became insecure and anxious because of her family problems. Meanwhile, Xu Fang has always had a short fuse. He’s the type of guy to lose his temper over a few words but he has always been exceptionally gentle towards Lin Xichi. Xu Fang has secretly loved Lin Xichi for many years until one day, because of a drunken stupor, Lin Xichi gradually realizes her feelings for Xu Fang too.>"
