	"description": "It’s hard to be beautiful\n\nEvery move you make; people will look at you.\n\nWhen you make a mistake; all eyes are on you.\n\nAnd the hardest part, if you want to pick your nose…\n\nYou just CAN’T …\n\n======\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday, I tripped in the hallway. Nobody seemed to notice, good thing I’m ugly.\n\n-Eya\n\nPS. Just kidding, I was seen and laughed at by Cross, my Bench model schoolmate.\n\n======\n\nEya is a kind-hearted girl who has faced several difficulties in life. Orphaned at the age of 14, her aunt adopts her but kicks her out as soon as she turns 18. Unable to make ends meet, she gets a new job as a nanny only to realize she has to look after Cross, an egoistic young man whom she calls the “monster”. Cross, having lost his mother at a young age, has grown resentful towards everybody around him. But regardless of their differences, they start to get along well.\n\nEya does not realize that she is caught up in a twisted, complicated love square (?). She starts developing a crush on her best friend Chad, who likes her friend Lory. However, Lory has had a crush on Cross since they were in kindergarten… How will this all pan out for Eya?>"
