	"description": "When the girl regained her senses she felt a sharp pain. All around her there was a darkness like sticky sludge. In that closed world a thin red light pierced through, allowing the girl to at long last open her eyes. What she saw was a strange red bird handing her a purple sphere. When she touched the sphere two lives inside her blended together.\n\nThe goal of the girl was to meet her 60-years life expectancy. But she wanted to lead fulfilling days, so she thrust her neck into various matters. Because her body was feeble, she had to temper it. This is the tale of a turbulent era and the girl who lived fiercely, resolutely, and noisily in it.>"
