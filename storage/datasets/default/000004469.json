	"description": "I possessed a character in the world of a novel.\n\nIn a devastating novel where all the characters are cut off by the villain’s hand.\n\nI just read the famous devastating novel to fix my shyness and build up my courage!\n\nBefore the real story begins,\n\nI must stay away from the terrifying capital city.\n\nSo I married a poor baron in the countryside….\n\n“Don’t let me clear your corpse with my hands. Okay?”\n\nThis man who showed up at the wedding covered in blood,\n\nmust be the scary villain who kills everyone!\n\nDon’t tell me,\n\nI married a man who would be a villain while trying to avoid the villain?\n\nI screwed up.\n\nI’ve probably made a mistake in getting married.>"
