	"description": "HA-HA-HA!\nI, Xiaoshen, the great and mighty dragon have awoken! I might be the last dragon remaining in the world, but my power is unparallel… Huh?… Where’s my lake? Who took my water?! Yuling Sect’s Founder, Fang Cun?! I’ll go there, and make them repay every debt they owe me from thousands of years ago! \nNow, where’s my bride? …Huh? He blocked my power then disappeared? Humans can’t be trusted… One cheats you, the other steals your water… Hmm… This Shang Jiyu guy is not as bad as the others… But only sometimes, which is weird… \nIlliterate? You’re the illiterate one! No, I’m not an octopus. Not a Jiao either! And definitely NOT a turtle! \nI am… the last azure dragon of the cultivation world!>"
