	"description": "As a gay who always falls in love with straight men by accident, Le Han has been single for twenty years. In the border of collapse, he looked up to the sky and requested the love of Lao Gong.\n\nAt this time, the popular virtual game across the country introduced a new way of marriage playing: Tie the knot, also known as ‘Choose the bride and choose the groom.’\n\nLe Han: Good, it’s just for me.\n\nHowever, facing the outstanding and elegant grooms in the ‘Groom Selection’ area, Le Han blushed shyly and was embarrassed to choose.\n\nSo he returned to the ‘Bride Selection’ area, put on a red wedding gown, covered his head with a red veil, and obediently waited for the gong to choose him.\n\n…He never expected that a big man would come.>"
