	"description": "Every profound love story must have a cannon fodder ex-girlfriend. If one day the ex-girlfriend blackens… aah, that would be fun! \n\nBlackened quote: Don’t be so quick to say like, I won’t be able to stop myself from hiding you away in the cabinet. Either you die, or I laugh as I watch you die. You thought you fell for an angel all on your own, therefore you deserve to be used by me.>"
