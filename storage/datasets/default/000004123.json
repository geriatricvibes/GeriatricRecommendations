	"description": "Jiang Yang and Qin Xu both dislike each other. Every time they meet they become filled with hatred. Both have feelings for the school idol but they didn’t expect that the other party was actually a cross-dressing man. In an instant, their world views were shattered. \n\n“Bound to the system. I shall assist with building the friendship between you and Qin Xu. Tasks will be released randomly and punishments will be enforced if it is not completed on time.”\n\nJiang Yang scoffed coldly: “What a joke! I’m not doing it!”\n\nLater….\n\nThe system exploded: “I wanted you to become friends but you became lovers instead?! You are the worst hosts I’ve ever had!”\n\nEventually the system transferred departments —– To the Matchmaking Department.>"
