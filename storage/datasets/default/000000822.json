	"description": "I was reincarnated as Zagan, the villain of my favorite Eroge from my past life. In the game, Zagan lived a pitiful life from childhood and was slaughtered in the end.\n\nBut when I lived a different life from the game Zagan, I often encountered the protagonist, Luca, in the city. It feels like I am being seen as a capture target… but I’m not a woman!?>"
