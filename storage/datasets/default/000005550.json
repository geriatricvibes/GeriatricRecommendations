	"description": "She was lying on the hospital bed, holding an insurance report tightly in her hands. Her mother hasn’t come to see her in a long time, and they all said that her mother didn’t want her anymore, but she knew that the stupid woman gave her own life to save her. After buying an accident insurance, her mother died, and all that was left was this piece of paper…\r\n\r\nThis was the 25th year since she was mistakenly taken by another family when she was born. In this year, she fell ill and her mother… died.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes suddenly, and what caught her eye was the all too familiar old stuff that only existed in her memory. When she looked at the calendar hanging on the wall it showed that the year was 1996, and she realized that she was reborn.\r\n\r\n(“The Salted-Fish Heroine Quit her job” – in this, what the author meant by ‘quit her job’ is : The heroine worked for her previous family free of charge in her previous life. And in this life, she doesn’t do that. That’s what it means.)>"
