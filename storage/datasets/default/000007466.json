	"description": "As I was going to confess to the senpai I admired, at that moment――『Ah, this guy is the protagonist of a gal game』what a close save…… I was about to be captured! Even though I reincarnated as a capturable target, I won’t be captured by you. Of course, I can’t put up with tying twin tails anymore so I’ll graduate from them! That’s why, stop following me around already!\n\nNote: chapter 1-7 (v1) is the original Pre-author-revised version>"
