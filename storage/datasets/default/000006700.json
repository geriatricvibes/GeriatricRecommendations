	"description": "Jude caught a serial killer who puts New York in a big panic. The name is Alvin Jones. Alvin is outwardly normal like any office worker. His demeanour and attitude make people highly unlikely to associate him with serial killings. However, his crime was discovered and he was caught. \n\nFor some reason, he finds that Detective Jude is an interesting person. Hence, he only talks when being interrogated by Detective Jude inside the interrogation room. This leaves all the crime profilers and psychologists in a quandary as he refuses to cooperate with them. Unsurprisingly, Alvin later escapes leaving a letter for Detective Jude. After his escape, his letters consistently reached Jude, and he seems to always help Jude whenever Jude is in trouble. Is there more to it than what it is on the surface? \n\n>"
