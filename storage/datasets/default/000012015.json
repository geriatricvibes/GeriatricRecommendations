	"description": "“I fell onto your shoulder, like coming home.”\n\nBecoming a policeman wasn’t Qin An’s original intention. That was just a certain someone’s dream. With Qin An’s grades, he could easily choose any top-tier university, but he willingly dropped fifty points to attend a public security university.\n\nGradually, he felt that attending a public security university was pretty good. At least they managed him almost like it was the military, keeping him very busy. This way, he wouldn’t have time to think about a certain someone who had suddenly vanished.\n\n9 years ago.\n\nRecently, there has been a very skinny youth with a large dog, always standing at the entrance of Tianyi High School. He watches the school gates like an eagle hunting for prey.\n\nHis name is Yan Shisan. When he sees the students start to leave, he yells, “Is Qin An done with class?”\n\nHe waits for Qin An to finish class, either to beat him up or ask for money. But in the end, Yan Shisan doesn’t succeed in doing either.\n\n9 years later: police officer gong x brilliant law school student shou\n\n9 years ago: unapproachable model high school student gong x orphaned vagrant shou>"
