	"description": "I possessed an extra who didn’t even have a name in the novel.\r\n\r\nHer features are black hair and purple eyes that means that she is cursed.\r\n\r\nAnd I’m the lost daughter of the villain in the novel?!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI thought I was a passing by extra, but she was actually the lost daughter of the villainous Grand Duke.\r\n\r\n“Erita, my beloved daughter.”\r\n\r\n“My precious little sister. I’ll protect you.”\r\n\r\n……are these the bloody villains I’ve seen?\r\n\r\nMy father and brother, who people said to be cruel, were too sweet to me.\r\n\r\nBut the villain has a death ending!\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I received love and warmth, and I decided to change the cruel ending of my friendly family since I possessed it 10 years earlier than the original.\r\n\r\nYeah, I will definitely change my family’s future……\r\n\r\n“Erita, I love you.”\r\n\r\nWhat’s wrong with the Male Lead?>"
