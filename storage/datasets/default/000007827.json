	"description": "She possessed the daughter of a ducal family’s vassal.\n\nShe became the weak young master’s companion, whose lifespan is reduced every time mana is used.\n\nWhile the young duke possessed stronger mana than the previous dukes, everyone thought that he would die before reaching adulthood. \n\n“Young master, this is my daughter, Heloise.”\n\n“……”\n\n“Heloise, why aren’t you giving your greetings?”\n\nZenon, the ill-tempered young master that had been left unattended for a long time.\n\nHer father, who said to get close to such a young master first.\n\nWhile she didn’t like it, she hung out with him as she felt sorry for him, who didn’t have any friends, but during then, Heloise came to a realisation.\n\nThis world was the world within a game,\n\nIn the near future, Zenon will be used as a ‘magic tool’,\n\nAnd he was destined to die. In addition, \n\n“Sometimes I forget that Zenon’s days are numbered. It would be lonely, but what can I do? Everyone is like that.”\n\nZenon’s uncle that kept interfering with his affairs was actually the mastermind!\n\nIt can’t be helped. For a peaceful life, Heloise decided to protect the young master.\n\n“You don’t need to worry about that at all. No matter what, I’ll somehow find a way.”\n\n“And, if the young master dies, I’ll soon follow suit.”\n\nBut for some reason, the young master seemed to be more concerned over something rather than his own life.\n\n“What did you just say?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“The words that you’re going to follow after me.”\n\nNo, is that important right now?>"
