	"description": "He once helped a lonely gal from his class.\n\nOn a rainy evening, Akira Akamori, a high school student about to transfer to a new school, saw his blonde classmate, Aoi Sotome, drenched from the rain in a nearby park.\n\n“… I don’t have a home anymore.”\n\nThough Aoi was a complete stranger to him, he couldn’t leave a girl alone, so he took her home.\n\n“Thanks for the help.”\n\n“I-It’s fine…”\n\nWhen Akira heard about Aoi’s complicated situation, he decided to help her and let her live with him until he transferred to a new school.\n\nWhile confused by their first time living together, the two slowly came close to each other.\n\nIt is a love story of two people who repeatedly meet and part ways, like a broken record.>"
