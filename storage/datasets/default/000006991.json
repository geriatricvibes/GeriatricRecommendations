Then one day he notices a girl in his class shrouded in mystery. Her name is Makina. However, the boy just can’t seem to bring himself to talk to Makina. Then one day, before the first lunar calendar month, another mysterious beauty appears. Her name is Rushia, and as she leans in as if she is going to kiss him, she tells him about a mysterious power hidden inside him called the “Snake Eyes.'>"
