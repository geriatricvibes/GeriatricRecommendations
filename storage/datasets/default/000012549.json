	"description": "As an aristocrat, Melida Angel studied at an academy that developed mana users but she did not have any mana. Kufa Vampir was dispatched to be her tutor and at the same time he was ordered to assassinate the girl if she did not have any talent. “Do you want to try to entrust your life to me?” he asked, as not an assassin nor a tutor but as someone that was betting on his pride as an assassin tutor, to show the girl’s worth to the world.>"
