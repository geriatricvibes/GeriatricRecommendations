	"description": "Hadius Meyer was the center of the world.\n\nHe was a beautiful person, who shined brightly among others.\n\nBut he didn’t brag or act arrogant.\n\nHe was fair to everyone.\n\nExcept for his fiancée, Emilia Bern.\n\n“I really want to be free now. I really hate you. From the bottom of my heart.”\n\n“How many times do I have to tell you so you understand? I don’t care about that.”\n\n“What on earth do you want?”\n\n“The Duchess of Meyer. My wife. As you know.”\n\nAn engagement only in name, he changed when she decided to end that weary relationship.>"
