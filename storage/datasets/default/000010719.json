	"description": "A young man, Haru Tajima, wanders into another world while playing a video game. Despite his bewilderment at this magical world, he tries to use his modern knowledge to make a name for himself... but finds that he isn't the first hero from another world. The people are well-fed, well-clothed, well-sheltered, live in prospering towns, and his half-baked knowledge is useless here. So, he resorts to a desperate plan for survival.\r\n\r\n'I have a special offer just for you. No, no, it's nothing suspicious. Where I come from, we call it a pyramid scheme...'>"
