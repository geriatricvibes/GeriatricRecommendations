	"description": "Joo Yi-Gyeol, who sleeps 22 hours a day has Rostov Syndrome.\n\nLearning to escape from the body while asleep, he follows a golden butterfly he encountered one day and crossed to another dimension.\n\nAnd there, he met the 4th prince Seth and saved him multiple times…\n\n* * *\n\n“Who said you could die as you please?”\n\nSeth’s hands wrapped around Yi-Gyeol’s face. His cheeks, wrapped in those big hands, felt excessively hot.\n\n“You can’t die even if you want to.”\n\nSeth’s face came close. His and Yi-Gyeol’s foreheads lightly touched.\n\n“I am the owner of your body. You can’t die without my permission.”\n\nYi-Gyeol could just inwardly shed tears at Seth’s mysterious remarks.>"
