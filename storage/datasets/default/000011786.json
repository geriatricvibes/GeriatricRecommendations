	"description": "In her previous lifetime, they had married for five years. He meant everything to her, but she was thrown away like an old shoe. \n\nAfter her rebirth, she gave him a divorce contract preemptively—\n\n“Divorce after one year, the terms of the contract are as follows: husband and wife shall not share a room or bed. Intimacy forbidden?”\n\nHe raised his eyebrow. \n\nWho knew that after she got drunk one day, leaning on the headboard, he rested his deep-set eyes on her. “You broke the contract, Mrs, Li.”>"
