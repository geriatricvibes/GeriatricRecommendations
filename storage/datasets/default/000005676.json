	"description": "“I’m going to live here with sister!”\n\nShe possessed a supporting role, who was swayed by the villain and killed by his male protagonist, Duke Claude Winterville. In addition, she accidentally picked up his nephew!\nFurthermore…\n\n“You better tell me the truth. How did you put me to sleep?”\n\nLike in the original novel, her ability to heal Claude's insomnia was revealed. In the end, she even received an offer as his exclusive barista to make’ sleeping coffee’ for him!\n\nHowever, to avoid the death flag, she had to decline the offer—\n\n“I'll open up a cafe in the capital, and of course, the owner will be you, April.”\n\nAs expected, the best treatment is financial treatment.\n\n“I’ll do it!”\n\nShe accepted the offer, blinded by her dream of opening her own cafe. \nShe was just trying to help him sleep well and only took Claude’s hand because of the beneficial offer… but, why did he suddenly get obsessed?\n\n“I won’t let you regret your decision.”\n\nSomehow, his gaze looked unusual.>"
