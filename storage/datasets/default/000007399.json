Those who are recorded by the gold list can get rewards.\n\n[Swordsmanship List] Zoro is ranked 100, Nami is ranked 50, and Li Fan is ranked first.\n\nMihawk: It turns out that someone’s swordsmanship is better for me! !\n\nSengoku: There are so many people in the world who have swordsmanship better than Mihawk!\n\nRaleigh: The world is getting more and more interesting.\n\nWorld Swordsman: It turns out that the world’s number one swordsman is not Mihawk, but Li Fan. Teacher Li Fan, please teach us swordsmanship.>"
