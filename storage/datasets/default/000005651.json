Going to class is exhausting.\n\nSomething that’s supposed to be normal became a burden to me.\n\nAnyone would be troubled if something so weird happens so suddenly, after all…\n\n“Needy Girl Syndrome”, a supernatural phenomenon that affects girls who feel something missing from their lives.\n\nI thought it was just some rumor, until it happened to us, who can’t find satisfaction from our lives.>"
