	"description": "Li Shen’s performance in the finals of 《Heavenly Voice》 stole the breaths of everyone present. The judging panel praised him, saying he was ‘a man kissed by a goddess.’ Li Shen faintly curved his lips. In his entire life, only the woman called Yu Wan had kissed him.\n\n—\n\nYu Wan didn’t expect to return to A City one day after leaving three years ago, and then to run into Li Shen again. \n\nAfter Li Shen found her, he said, “Yu Wan, can I ask you to plan a wedding?”\n\nYu Wan asked, “Who are the newlyweds?”\n\nLi Shen replied, “Li Shen and Yu Wan.”>"
