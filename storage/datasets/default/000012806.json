	"description": "It was revenge. Gu Ze wanted Meng Fu to pay for killing his wife and child in a hit and run.\r\n\r\n“Meng Fu, why don’t you kill yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gu, I can’t...”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll make sure you suffer.”\r\n\r\nOnly after stripping naked and lying in bed did Meng Fu finally realize what Gu Ze meant.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gu, please. I was wrong...”\r\n\r\n“I want to see you suffer, Meng Fu. Only when you’re in pain will I be able to feel a little better.”\r\n\r\nBut it was when he truly did slit his wrist and laid in a pool of blood did Gu Ze feel his heart break again.\r\n\r\nBut he did not dare to tell him. “Meng Fu, did you know? I’ve secretly fallen in love with you.”>"
