	"description": "-- All the reunions with the person you had a crush on in the past are long-cherished schemes.\r\n\r\nRuan Yu’s web novel on Jinjiang, “Really Want to Nibble on Your Ear”, has been accused of plagiarism.\r\n\r\nShe posted on Weibo: God knows, this story about a crush is from my own personal experience back when I was still a student.\r\n\r\nThe other author called someone on the phone after seeing it: “Brother, I seem…… to have found the person you have a crush on.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, Ruan Yu, who had been “exposed,” looked at the prototype of the male lead in her novel and kept shaking her hand: “I don’t know him, don’t know him……” \r\n\r\nXu Huaisong smiled with gritted teeth: You’ve already nibbled my ear. It’s too late to play dumb.>"
