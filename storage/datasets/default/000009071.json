	"description": "I was born with an incredibly frail body. When the curtain was about to close on my life at the age of 17, a breathtakingly cute angel with a gentle smile appeared before me and gave me the body of another person.\n\nThe owner of the body seems to have gone to end her own life. I got this body because her death was unscheduled, but I don’t intend to follow her path.\n\nAnyways, this is a really healthy body! Not like the weak body I had at all!\n\nThank you very much! I’ll make sure to live life to the fullest in this body no matter what obstacles come my way!\n\nWhat!? This girl was hated? Her family shuns her? That doesn’t matter. I can overcome anything now that I have a healthy body! I don’t care that she didn’t have friends. Besides, I didn’t have any either!\n\nAll right, I’ll try my best in this new life!>"
