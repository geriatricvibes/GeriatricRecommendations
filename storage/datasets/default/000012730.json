	"description": "“If you don’t remember, it wouldn’t hurt to remind you.”\r\n \r\nIt’s been 20 years since I reincarnated as an extra in a book. I’ve been avoiding the villain for 20 years in order to not be killed by him like the original ending. After drinking alcohol, I faced the Duke of Chester, the villain in the original story.\r\n \r\n“You have to take responsibility for me, Yulia.”\r\n \r\n“Duke, I…”\r\n \r\n“Yulia, you have to take responsibility for me.”\r\n \r\nHe started kissing each and every joint of my finger. Unlike his sweet behavior, his eyes contained a menacing look, as if wanting to eat people.\r\n \r\n“Yulia, don’t even think about getting out of here.”\r\n \r\nI’m afraid those words sound like a threat.\r\n \r\nWill I be able to safely escape from the villain?>"
