He picks up a street child who shamelessly latches onto him and gives him the name Xiaoyuan.\n\nWei Qian dreams of rising above the crop. He is someone who values money over his own life. In the earlier part of his life, he battles against many obstacles, with his number one mission being to make a name for himself. Finally, when he achieves some success and thinks that heâ€™s seeing the light of daybreak in life, Xiaoyuan suddenly goes crazy.>"
