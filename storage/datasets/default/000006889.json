	"description": "Everyone knew Shen Nianshen so well.\r\nIn this world, there would probably be no female creatures that could enter his heart. Even the most beautiful girl in the school was coldly rejected.\r\n\r\nUntil one day, when there was a basketball match at the school. In the front row of the audience, there was a girl whose head was accidentally hit by the ball.\r\n\r\nShen Nianshen immediately ran to her. Everybody thought that he only went to get the ball. Unexpectedly, he squatted down in front of the girl, stroked her head gently, and asked anxiously, “Does it hurt?”\r\n\r\nThis a sweet love story between a cold guy and a lively girl.>"
