	"description": "Marriage is like a besieged city. People who are outside the city wish to enter while people who are inside the city wish to leave.\n\nJi Xuan racked her brains just to divorce Sheng Zeyan, the male god who has captured the hearts of thousands of women. Who would have thought that no matter what she did, Sheng Zeyan remained unswayed, always indulging and pampering her. He was perfect, except that he did not personally pick and send her when she had a friendly meet up with her first love.\n\nHowever, once she lost her life in the besieged city and threw away her feelings, a divorce agreement was placed in front of her. Her perfect* husband became a familiar stranger.\n\n“Didn’t you always want your freedom? Now I’m giving it to you.”\n\n「But you do not know, that since the day I fell in love with you, freedom no longer has any meaning. 」\n\n*二十四孝 – The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars.
