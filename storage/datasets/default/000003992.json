	"description": "If this was the case, she shouldn’t have been born at all.\r\n\r\nThe first twins of the Royal Family had been branded as ominous beings and Roelin’s existence was completely erased in the Separate Palace.\r\n\r\nIt was unfair, but instead of the twin sister, they told her to be the monster’s bride…?\r\n\r\n‘It’s a rather good thing actually.’\r\n\r\nIf she were to get out of this huge prison, she would then be the wife of a monstrous emperor.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to Seroif, Princess Erita.”\r\n\r\n“It is such an honor for the leader of the Empire to welcome me like this.”\r\n\r\nRoelin was determined as she headed to the Empire. But Kergel, who had been said to be a monster, was surprisingly caring.\r\n\r\n“Roelin. The name goes quite well with you.”\r\n\r\nHe thought that this name was even better than the original name itself.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Kergel, who made her heart pound, would Roelin be able to live safely as a fake bride?>"
