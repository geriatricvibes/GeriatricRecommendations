My stepbrother was a capture target in that game.\n\nAnd I became the younger brother from his memories, the one who only appeared in his personal story and was supposed to die soon!\n\n‘Honestly, I don’t care if the younger brother of my absolute fave dies! But no, I can’t die until I see my absolute fave grow up! I’ll live! I’m going to smash the death flags and adore my absolute fave today as well!’\n\nThis is the story of a reincarnated younger brother in an otome game and his struggles with all of his death flags.>"
