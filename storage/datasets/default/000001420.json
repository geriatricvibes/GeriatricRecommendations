	"description": "When she stands, she’s like a white peony. When she sits, she’s like a tree peony. When she walks, she’s like a lily flower. And when you look her in the eyes, she’s like the Great King of Terror.\n\nDespite having the qualities to be a peerless bishoujo, because of the look of her eyes and that atmosphere of hers, she’s feared by others; such a girl is forcefully sent to another world.\n\nBeing told that she would be granted a wish as a special favour, the girl made a wish────\n\n“Make my eyes and atmosphere normal please.”\n\nThis is a story recounting the lifestyle in a parallel world of a girl who would be perfect (probably) if just her one weakpoint was overcome.\n\nA fantasy comedy with magic, dungeons, and a hero and demon king(candidate) who she gets tangled up with.\n\nShe’s cursed though.>"
