	"description": "AWM: PUBG's highest damage dealing and most difficult to acquire, monstrous sniper rifle within the game. The ultimate air-drop dream, with ample power doing large harm, one shot to the head is enough for one to fall to the ground, regardless of the head gear one may be wearing. Its only disadvantage: The odds of it dropping make it extremely difficult to obtain, in which it all relies on luck. \n\nYou are my AWM, meaning: You are the one who I can only come across serendipitously. >"
