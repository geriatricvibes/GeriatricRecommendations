	"description": "Surdo was the king of the Golden Wolf tribe, while Dyria was an enemy soldier. Their romance was supposed to be a one-time affair during the war. However, it became a major issue when Dyria became pregnant with the wolf's childâ€”Ash, whom he had been hiding in a remote village. \n\nAfter a very arduous search six years later, Dyria and Ash were forcibly taken to live in the palace of the Golden Wolf tribe. And there he met Yudha, the younger brother of the wolf who he had love with the night of the war.>"
