	"description": "Gu Wen Jing is a good actor by nature and has a pair of golden eyes that can see through acting skills.\n\nWhen he encounters a green tea who is ‘pretending’ to be someone else, he can’t help but expose their true colours.\n\nHence the nickname: Green Tea Specialist!\n\nAfter a lifetime of living peacefully, Gu Wen Jing, a Green Tea Specialist, has his soul bound by the ‘Male Host Shining Eye System’ that has been targeting him for a long time, so he has to travel to various worlds to be a normal male host who is not captivated by a green tea.\n\nNotes :\n1. ‘pretending’ 装模作样 (zhuāngmózuòyàng): to put on an act (idiom); to show affectation / to indulge in histrionics.\n2. Green tea 绿茶 (lǜchá): green tea / (slang) (of a girl) seemingly innocent and charming but actually calculating and manipulative.>"
