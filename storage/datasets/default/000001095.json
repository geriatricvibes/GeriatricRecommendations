	"description": "My lover has always been a little pitiful, but he will eventually turn into a big BOSS;\n\nMy lover has always been in love with me at first sight, but I also think he is very pleasing to the eye.\n\nMy lover has always been jealous, but I didn’t know what he’s jealous of. It is really troubling.\n\nMy lover has always had two faces; the face he shows others and the one he shows me which are completely different. It’s very confusing…\n\nBai Duan: This is my life. ╮(╯▽╰)╭>"
