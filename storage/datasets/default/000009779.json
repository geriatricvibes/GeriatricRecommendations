He discovered he had no Sharingan, No Dead Bone Pulse, No Kekkai Genkai and that he did not have a surname.\n\nOtsutsuki.\n\nHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HIS OWN SURNAME!\n\nJust when he thought that he would live a mediocre life in the Naruto World, his Father, Konoma told him that they were returning to the Village, where he discovered…\n\nThat the God of Shinobi, Hashirama is his 1st Grandfather\n\nThat Tobirama Senju, the God of Ninjutsu is his 2nd Grandfather\n\nThat Tsunade one of the 3 Sanin is his Sister\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Soyokaze not only found out that his relations are the strongest, but that he also awakened his Golden Finger, an Almighty Sign-In System!\n\nThis rekindled his ambitions and he set himself a small goal of replacing Hiruzen Sarutobi as the 3rd Hokage when he is 20 years old.\n\nUnexpectedly, he completed this small goal of his when he was 8 years old!>"
