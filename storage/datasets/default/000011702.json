	"description": "Summoning ceremonies can freely call forth even 'those which lurk in the depths beyond the gods'. One boy has top-level abilities even among the cutting-edge summoners who can use those ceremonies. He is Alice (with) Rabbit aka Shiroyama Kyousuke. But this strongest boy summoner has a single fatal weakness. Certain 'cursed words' spoken by girls: 'Help me.'\r\n\r\nWhen Kyousuke hears those words from Meinokawa Higan, a girl brought to the verge of death, he throws himself into a city where three great summoner forces clash!>"
