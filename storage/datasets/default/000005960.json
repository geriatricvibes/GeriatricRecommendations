	"description": "The apocalypse started with an acid rain and a contagious virus that turned people into carrion.\r\n\r\nAfter her rebirth, Lan Shiruo is dedicated to repaying her adoptive parents for everything they put her through , she does not want her  human-faced and animal-hearted family , who sacrificed her and her child for their own selfishness.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the apocalypse, she was reborn in blood, and she will take her son and her husband to fight the world.\r\n\r\nThe girls came one after another, 'Sister, let me hug your thigh'\r\n\r\nThe guys followed closely, 'Sister-in-law, please support me.'\r\n\r\nA certain steamed bun tilted his head and drooled, 'Auntie blamed Shufan for grabbing numbness, Baba, come on.'\r\n\r\nA certain dog stared at death, 'Master, come into the arms of this mastiff.'\r\n\r\nA certain dog man with an indifferent face, 'Go away, that's my wife.' Turning his head and putting on a grieving face, he confronted his little wife and said, 'My wife, please pity me.'>"
