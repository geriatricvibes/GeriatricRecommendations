	"description": "A huge space immigrant ship where every single human being has already died. What greeted me when I arrived there was a group of “robot” girls.\r\n\r\nApparently, I’m the only human in this part of the universe with a radius of a dozen light years or so, and the girls are designed to obey humans according to the three laws of robotics.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of robots who are bewildered by the first people they see, but try to serve them, and me who is bewildered by them, but tries to carry out my mission.>"
