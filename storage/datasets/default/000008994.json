	"description": "As death approaches,\r\nI realized that this world was just someone else's work.\r\n\r\nMy family died, and my life was not easy.\r\nAll were devices for the awakening of the female protagonist and her splendid ending.\r\nIsn't it too much to say that everyone except me becomes happy?\r\n\r\n'Don't make me laugh. Who died?’\r\n\r\nIt was none of my business whatever happened to the novel.\r\nFar from the original, I did not die and survived persistently.\r\nBy the way… A romance that has never happened with the male lead's older brother began.\r\n\r\n“Do you like me?”\r\n“It is precisely love. Aisa, please put me next to you.”\r\n“…”\r\n“Please, make me happy.”\r\n\r\nYou love me? That's your stupid mistake.\r\nBut I'm not going to correct you for being mistaken.\r\nYou are a person of great value.\r\n\r\n“You chose it.”\r\n\r\nSaying so, I reached out and grabbed him by the collar and pulled him closer.\r\nHe was meekly drawn to me.\r\n\r\n'If you hold my hand and leave this room, I'll be happy for the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\nI know many things will change if I hold his hand.\r\nNevertheless, that night, I held the hands of Norma Diazi, the most handsome man in the empire.>"
