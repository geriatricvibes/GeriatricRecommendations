	"description": "After I woke up, it seems I was in 8-year-old boy's body. I was excited at first... But, it turns out I was reincarnated as a commoner, there isn't a bath, there isn't a proper toilet, and the food tastes like crap! Ahh! I want to go back to japan now! Since it's impossible to go back, I am stuck here. And so, I decided to have a goal; 'Have a comfortable life!'\r\n\r\nBut it seems impossible to even do that... What did you say? Aristocrats have baths? They have a proper toilet? They even have a full bathroom!? Then I'll just become an aristocrat!!\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the boy who decided to become a noble to become rich and live comfortably, but somehow ended up saving the world without him even knowing it.>"
