She is finally able to share a kiss with the one she has always loved just like in her dreams. “You are mine, my adorable queen.”\n\nA hot wedge pierces her lower abdomen, and intense pleasure crawls through her entire body.\n\n“I will never leave you.”\n\nIn his tight embrace, she was happy…\n\nEvery day after that, as if he had let go of all restraints, she is devoured by absolute possessiveness.\n\nThis is the worryingly lewd newlywed life of a knight and a queen!>"
