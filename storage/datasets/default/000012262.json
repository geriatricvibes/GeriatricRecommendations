	"description": "Before rebirth, Xia Man had been wondering, when did Qu Zhen begin to hate her?\n\nWas it when she foolishly followed behind her and constantly talked while eating? Or when she would always clumsily break the gifts she was given? So she started hating her?\n\nDid she think such a person was not worthy of being her friend at all? Doesn’t deserve the sunshine?\n\nRight! Sunshine or whatever, it can only be her Qu Zhen!\n\nXia Man always felt that the friendship between the two was like Qu Zhen’s alms to herself, never equal.\n\nXia Man didn’t understand what Qu Zhen meant until she died.\n\n“I thought I never missed it. Now I understand that I’ve never been right.”\n\nQu Zhen, in a sense, died by Xia Man’s hands, not from a zombie.\n\nQu Zhen, you could never have been right after doing something wrong. You should never fall in love with a person with a distorted personality.\n\nAfter Xia Man was reborn, she only wanted one thing.\n\nShe wanted those who used her to hurt Qu Zhen to die rather than to live!>"
