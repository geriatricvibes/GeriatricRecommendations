	"description": "My dream was you, Na HaYeon.\n\nModel HaYeon has been in a relationship with actor Taewan for a long time. The love that started at the tender age of eighteen is about to end at twenty-nine.\n\n'Let's break up now, Taewan. Let's stop.'\n\n'Why do you want to break up? Are you telling me the love is gone?'\n\n'No, the love isn't gone.'\n\nThe love had never gone away for a moment. From the moment he walked over with the springtime as his backdrop, it had always been there.\n\n'I still love you.'\n\n'Then why?'\n\nTaewan shouted out as if he couldn't understand.\n\n'I don't have the confidence to love you tomorrow.'\n\n'......'\n\n'That's the reason.'\n\nMe, the one who tells you it's the end even though I said it wasn't.\n\nYou, the one who knows it's the end but can't end it.\n\nThis love that only gives us more wounds as we stay together...\n\nWill we be able to protect it?>"
