	"description": "Zhou Li had transmigrated into a tooth-rottingly sweet novel.\n\nThe sweet novel tells the story of a tragic male protagonist who was turned into a dog, abused by a gangster, rescued by the heroine, before finally marrying the heroine.\n\nZhou Li’s fate was pitiful, and he transmigrated into the animal-abusing gangster.\n\nWhen he transmigrated, he found his foot stepping down on a dog’s head.\n\nLooking at the dying dog, then thinking about the male lead’s character, he realised that his life was held in this little puppy’s paws.>"
