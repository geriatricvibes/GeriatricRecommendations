	"description": "LingYang spent 500RMB to buy a ladyboy account, and it came with a husband?\n\nJust after logging into the game he was informed that the account was in debt, and he had no choice but to sell himself and act as a couple with his ‘husband’.\n\nLingYang: I only bought an account, why must you force a husband on me?\n\nYeLang: You can also choose not to take the husband but the debt instead.\n\nLingYang: Dear, can I not have the free gift?\n\nYeLang: Sorry, it’s a bundle, no returns allowed.\n\nAt first glance, it’s a story about how a little antelope accidentally entered the embrace of a big-tailed wolf after escaping from a tiger’s den.\n\nBut it’s actually an inspirational story about how an innocent straight man was actively turned gay by a little bottom with a boots fetish, then went through a series of complex mentality changes, finally becoming a cold-blooded, black-bellied S top!>"
