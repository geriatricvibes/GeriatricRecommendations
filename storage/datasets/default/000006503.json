I felt sorry for her and took care of her......\r\n\r\n'Thanks to you, I wasn't lonely at all in exile.'\r\n\r\nThe princess' older brother rebelled and became the Emperor! Naturally, the exile of the princess ended.\r\n\r\n“You saved my life last time, so you are my lifesaver. Come with me to the Imperial Palace.'\r\n\r\nEventually, I went to the Imperial Palace with her and met the Emperor......\r\n\r\n'......Jared?'\r\n\r\nWait, why is my ex here?>"
