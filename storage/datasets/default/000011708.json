	"description": "She lost six years of her life to a rat bastard. When she was dying, her boyfriend ran off with someone else.\r\n\r\nWith no other choice, she walked towards the man with unmatched power and money, who was arrogant and cold. “Donate your bone marrow to me!”\r\n\r\nHis clear gaze shuttered. “I would never did it for charity. Unless you devote your life to me.”\r\n\r\nShe yelled, “You’re crazy!”\r\n\r\nThe man watched her angry silhouette as she left and smiled. Not only was he going to give her his bone marrow, he was going to give himself to her as a package deal.>"
