Jim, stabbed by his remorse of losing Nayla, unable to forget his past cowardice of failing to fulfill his promise to her. Within the veil of despair, guilt and worthlessness, Jim met The Telltaler, the creator and the guardian of fairytales.\n\nTogether with “Floating City Fleet”, Jim the orphan who grew up with strangers' kindness, a poor man who was only good at playing violin, a young man who was too cowardly to face his fate... Changed themselves and became the important figures in the expedition to find the Land of Hope. Fighting with the legendary pirate of the continental border, visiting and climbing Adam’s Peak, until he became the hero of civil war in Champa country, everything he went through while wrestling with the stifling ghost of the past. \n\nSo, what will be the price of those journeys?\n\n“Will you die for me too?” Nayla asked Jim softly. \n\nShe hugged him gently, silently.\n\n“Trust me! A true lover will never give you up until Death picks him up.”>"
