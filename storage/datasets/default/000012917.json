	"description": "Being a direct disciple of the Qijue sect meant severing all seven emotions, six desires, righteousness, and morality. When Ye Zhi met that person, he finally understood why the sect had such a rule.\n\nLike a water drop on the desert sand, he relieved his thirst and awakened his desire.\n\nLike a moth to flame, he was seduced and willing to perish for that thing called emotions.\n\nAbandoned all worldly attachments, in the end, couldn’t help yearning for one word, affection.>"
