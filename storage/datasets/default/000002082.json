	"description": "Even childhood friends who used to be close will inevitably grow apart over time.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange to see a childhood friend who is becoming more beautiful the closer she gets to adulthood, and to feel downhearted about whether it is okay for me to be by her side.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a girl and me who, through a chance encounter, came closer to each other again.>"
