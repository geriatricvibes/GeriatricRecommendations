	"description": "At the age of ten, anyone would receive two skills from an entity called God.\r\nA girl who wants to be an adventurer, Reno, was given automatic attack evasion skill, [Dodge] and a skill to be able to put in and out items, [Storage].\r\nNeither skill was suitable for battle, so she was living the gloomy days of being a luggage carrier without being an adventurer.\r\n\r\nHowever, wheel of fate turned heavily when she joined an Evil Dragon slaying party as a luggage carrier.\r\nAbandoned by the Hero in the deepest part of the dungeon where the dragon is hidden, Reno got the power to fight when she acquired a necklace which the strongest Dragon Slayer, Reina’s spirit sealed in.\r\n\r\nThis is an epic of a girl who later would be called The Dragon-Killing Hero.>"
