Her stepmother and stepsister hated her and bullied her.\r\n\r\nAs she grew older, Maya realized that she had a special ability; she could see people’s lives through touching their hands.\r\n\r\nOne day, Maya stumbled into the empty house next door and found a writing of a woman who had already passed away. Maya could “see” that the woman had a relationship with Setiawan. And who is Boy, the young man that she met in that empty house?\r\n\r\nNote: Tags contain spoiler>"
