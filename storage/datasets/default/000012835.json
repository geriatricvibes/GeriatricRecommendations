	"description": "I, Yusuke Fujishiro, work at an IT agency. As an in-house engineer, I am the only one in a glittering company who is in the shadows.\n\nEvery day I’m exhausted from the work taken by the cool salespeople and from dealing with the conscious designers. Even so, I can do my best because of the high-level facial features of the girls.\n\nHowever, as a shy person, I was only able to feast my eyes on them. But one day, the most beautiful PR person in the company, who has a history of winning a certain beauty contest, came to talk to me.\n\nThe PR lady who is an idol in the company is a bigger clunker than I expected?　She finds out that I’m actually a secret influencer and I have to produce and help her with her SNS operations.\n\nA work-related romantic comedy by an insensitive, shy guy and a giggly, cheerful girl!>"
