	"description": "“You are going to be my first wife!” Huang Xiaolong explained to Song Yuru, moments after they had met on the train. 'You quack!' A man to the side harrumphed, neither he nor Song Yuru were amused by the statement. Little did they know that this hillbilly from the mountains had a few tricks up his sleeves and a handsome face to make up for his awful sense of fashion. With three missions in mind- earn lots of money, get a wife (or a dozen), and get a university degree, Huang Xiaolong was about to take Coast City by storm!>"
