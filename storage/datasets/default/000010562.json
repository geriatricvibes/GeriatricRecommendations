	"description": "The most beautiful Young Lady in society. Lily Hedwick.\n\nShe escaped her ill-fated marriage and headed for the Duke’s castle in the deep snow mountains.\n\n“Please allow me to stay in this castle.”\n\n “You can’t do that. What about your honor?”\n\nBlake found her annoying. It was a look Lily was used to.\n\n“Hide me for a year, and then I will leave without complaint.”\n\n***\n\nBut….\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n“Now, I remembered everything, Miss.”\n\nBlake put his lips on top of hers.\n\n“You made a promise to me when we were young. You were going to marry me.”\n\n“M…me?”\n\n“Now it’s time to keep your promise.”\n\nLily couldn’t even breathe at the man’s persistent kiss.\n\n“You’ll have to take responsibility for me.”>"
