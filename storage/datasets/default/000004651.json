Before long he starts to influence the movements of the world from the shadows.\n\nThe protagonist will change.\n\nBased on the Annals of the Three Kingdoms, it’s aimed at those being curious about military history and those, who don’t know the Annals of the Three Kingdoms, enjoying to read about it.>"
