	"description": "I, Margarete Fondine, an Earl’s daughter recovered my past life’s memories when I was hovering at the boundaries of life and death. \r\n\r\nI have reincarnated as the heroine in my favorite otome game from my past life. \r\n\r\nBut, hold on a second. \r\n\r\nAm I really the heroine?\r\n\r\nIn my past life, I also liked web novels. \r\n\r\nParticularly stories that featured villainesses as the main characters, reading a trifling amount that roughly exceeded three figures. \r\n\r\nIn those stories, the heroine was generally a fool who paid for her mistakes through a tragic end.\r\n\r\nIf I am perhaps not the heroine, then am I not the stalker heroine in the villainess’ story?\r\n\r\nWhether I’m the heroine or not, it is necessary for me to investigate this first. \r\n\r\nThis is all for the sake of not attracting my future destruction! \r\n>"
