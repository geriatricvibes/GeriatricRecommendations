	"description": "SGH is a multiplayer online tactical competitive shooting game.\n\nWhen Wen Xi first came into contact with the game, like most people, he used a gun as his main weapon.\n\nBut his shooting skills were too poor, often having teammates vent about whether he was the master of outlining the human body.\n\nUntil one day, he picked up a bow.\n\nSince then, SGH has had another archer assassin named “Wency”.\n\nIt’s said that his arrows never miss their shot, a hundred shots and a hundred hits, killing with one blow.\n\nIt’s said that only the first ranked sharpshooter “Mac” succeeded in killing him.\n\nIt’s said that he likes “Mac”.\n\nWen Xi: …where did this rumor come from? Mac, come out and clarify!\n\nMo Chen: En, it’s a rumor. Actually, I like you.\n\nA shou who wholeheartedly wants to make money through livestreaming vs. A gong who wholeheartedly wants to trick the shou into joining his team.>"
