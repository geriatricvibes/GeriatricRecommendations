	"description": "She transmigrated to a reverse harem strategy game that was developed by the company she’s working for. Of all the characters, she possessed Belita, the daughter of a noble family who has the supporting role of a villain who bullies the heroine and dies! \r\n\r\nEven the four target characters will kill her alternately. Male Lead 1, who kills Belita, despite being related by blood, Male Lead 2, who kills her because she’s annoying, Male Lead 3, who kills her for justice, and Male Lead 4, who kills Belita as if it’s not a big deal.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that she’ll die no matter which side she gets caught in. The only way to live is to be the heroine's helper and create a happy ending for the game! \r\n\r\n'Get out of my way. I'll decide the ending.'\r\n>"
