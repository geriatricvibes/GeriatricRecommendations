	"description": "“Then why don’t I marry you!” Yu Dong suddenly proposed.\n\n“You…” Xia Feng thought he had misheard.\n\n“You see, you’re looking for someone to marry to ease your mother’s heart, and I also want to get married. We’re right in front of the doors to the Civil Affairs Bureau, and with all our papers too!” Yu Dong exclaimed while holding up her red household book.\n\n“And the most important thing is that we just broke up with our exes. This is fate, ah!”\n\nRight up until they left the Civil Affairs Bureau again, holding a newly registered red book, Xia Feng remained dazed still wondering, how did he end up getting married?\n\nDid he just pick up a wife at the doors to the Civil Affairs Bureau?\n\nWhat Xia Feng doesn’t know is that Yu Dong traveled back in time from 10 years in the future. \n\nNow, having a second chance in life and able to secure a good husband, Yu Dong will live her life at full throttle and without regrets.>"
