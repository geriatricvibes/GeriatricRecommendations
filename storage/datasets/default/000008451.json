One night, right after she is recognized, the man asks her angrily, “No way have you really forgotten about me!” Scratching her hair, she replies, “I’m so sorry, I suffer face blindness, your face doesn’t ring a bell to me.” The man whispers at her ears, “That night, half a year ago…” Flushing crimson, she cried, “It’s you!” Yup! It’s me in the flesh! Face blindness? No problem at all, let’s see if you can remember me after I spend the rest of your life with you.>"
