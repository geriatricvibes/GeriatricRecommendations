	"description": "'Don't touch there, it's dirty...' Su Yanyun flushes. The man smiles slightly and wipes the mud stains on her feet. \r\n\r\n'My baby, it's not dirty.' \r\n\r\nOvernight, Young Master Yi changes from being a clean freak who is unable to even get close to his relatives to being desensitized and doting on this little woman of unknown origins. \r\n\r\n'Hubby, the baby in my belly is calling you!' \r\n\r\nEven if he has to cross half of Earth, Young Master Yi would still fly back overnight. \r\n\r\n'Boohoo, Hubby, they called the baby a bastard!' \r\n\r\nCapture all the scums who spread this rumor! \r\n\r\n'Hubby, I want to bring our baby on a trip!' \r\n\r\nYoung Master Yi: 'Don't forget to bring your luggage.' \r\n\r\n'Which one?' \r\n\r\n'Me.'>"
