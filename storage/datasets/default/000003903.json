	"description": "The Prince of Su Wang, Chu Ba Ning is not famous because of his great status and power, but because legend has it that whoever becomes his wife will be cursed to death, with no children to inherit his fortunes.\n\nEver since the Emperor betrothed Lu Shao Qi to Chu Ba Ning, everyone had predicted that she will not be living a long life. Even the biggest casino in the capital city would gamble and make bets about how she would die. The side-concubines gifted to the Prince of Su Wang would also cry and kneel to the ground to hug Lu Shao Qi’s legs, begging for her to not drag them to death with her.\n\nLu Shao Qi complains: Heavens! Is it easy to find a virtuous wife like me? Such a fortune and you don’t know how to appreciate it!>"
