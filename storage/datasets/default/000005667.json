	"description": "Passion and revenge around Shanghai beach. The story is about the growth of the wealthy ‘doing Heaven and Earth’ Miss Jiao.\r\n\r\nRebirth without revenge was like living in vain.\r\n\r\nTang Jiao, dressed in western style and holding a sutra, was shaking her legs while sitting on the wall. She asked herself, with so many enemies, which one should I start first with?\r\n\r\nGu Tingyun was watching her, the delicate girl. He smiled and kept shut while pinching the beads. Click clack. And he thought, Little Bastard...don’t let me find you…!\r\n\r\nSadistic but cool and original novel placed in the Republic of China. Step by step, the first-class and ‘do Heaven and Earth’ Big Boss will fiercely swallow the distressed but pretty Lolita Jiao in his stomach.>"
