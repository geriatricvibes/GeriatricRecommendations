	"description": "Luciel is a [Crystal Fairy].  \n\nSomeone who can create jewelry when she feels strong emotions.\n\nShe died after being exploited and returned to the past!\n\n'This time, I will never live like that.’\n\nIn order to avoid the worst future possible, she even proposed a contract marriage to the Empire's top villain family.\n\nBut something became weird. The start of this relationship was definitely temporary.\n\n'How about becoming my daughter instead of a daughter-in-law?'\n'I always wish I had a granddaughter, this is just perfect.'\n'When I grow up, I will marry my sister-in-law.'\n\nHow come they are doing this to me when they were said to be villians?\nBesides...\n\n'Whether it's a jewel or a flower, it doesn't matter to me what you make.'\n\nThe reaper of Bellstein.\n\nThe man who was in ruins in her past life said so with a fresh smile on his young face.\n\n'If you get out of my sight, I'll chase you to the end, Luciel.'\n>"
