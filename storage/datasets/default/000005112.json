	"description": "Xing Ye couldn’t accept the sudden death of his younger brother, and as he searched for answers, he recalled the QR code he once saw on his brother’s phone. Having a photographic memory, he was able to quickly sketch out the QR code. Upon scanning it with his phone, he then finds himself transported to an all-white room, where, at the very middle, a giant cube was afloat.\n\nXing Ye then learned that his brother was a player in this Game of Challenging Fate, and to learn how his brother died, he signed himself up to it.\n\nLater, he gets ahold of a sentient mirror, and the very existence of it hints at the truth of what this Game is really about.>"
