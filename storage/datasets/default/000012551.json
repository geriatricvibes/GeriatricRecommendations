	"description": "I'm enjoying a carefree life on my own, when I receive a sudden confession from Yuzu Nanamine, the most popular girl in my class. She wants me to pretend to be her boyfriend in order to solve a love triangle between her clique! I reluctantly agreed to the offer, but...\n\n'Look, look, look, are you happy to see your pretty girlfriend's cheerful smile?' \n\nYuzu is always acting like a cat in the classroom, but her narcissistic behavior in front of me is really annoying. \n\nThe two of them spend time alone together, and it becomes a part of their daily lives. A geeky otaku and a narcissist. A cute youth romantic comedy that begins with two 'fake couples' with very different interests and personalities!>"
