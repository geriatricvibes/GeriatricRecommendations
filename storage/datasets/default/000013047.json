	"description": "I, Mikyo Yuu, have a girlfriend that I’ve been dating since I was in junior high school. She is a yandere. She sends me messages every day, and if I send her even a few messages, I get dozens of notifications.\t\n\nI often wake up in the morning and before I know it, she’s home and on top of me.\n\nSometimes I have a feeling that makes me wonder if l am committing a crime by getting involved with other women.\n\nIt’s just that—if I tell her I love her, she twitches so adorably, so there’s no problem.>"
