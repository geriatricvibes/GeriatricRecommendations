	"description": "Her whole life, Sigrid lived as an imperial knight, a loyal servant, and a faithful subject. However, her loyalty was rewarded with disgrace, dishonor, false accusation, and a guillotine.\r\n\r\n“If I came back,” she vowed, '... I’m not going to live a life like that again!'\r\n\r\nExecuted at the guillotine for assassinating the Crown Prince, Sigrid somehow opened her eyes again... and found herself five years before the day of her execution.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, Sigrid had lived an immaculate and principled life. However, now that she was given a second chance, she knew better.>"
