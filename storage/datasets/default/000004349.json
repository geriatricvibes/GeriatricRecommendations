	"description": "Betrayed by his lover and abandoned by mankind, the race he saved, Rohen gave up all hopes in life.\r\n\r\nReturning to the past, he laid down his sword and allowed the world to perish as he stood in the side. Just as man turned his back on him, he, too, will do the same.\r\n\r\nThis was his pledge.\r\n\r\nBut, his view changes little by little when he meets a girl wielding the same scars as him.\r\n\r\nShe changes him… heals his broken scar without notice.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLooking at Rohen, his body torn and mangled, she burst into tears and asked, “Why… why didn’t you run away?”\r\n\r\nHe heard her sweet voice. It calmed him. She protected him.\r\n\r\nRohen laughed. “Because you’re here.”>"
