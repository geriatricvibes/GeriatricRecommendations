	"description": "Tao Xi knew the fate of being deliberately exchanged at birth by his “mother” in the third year of middle school. He lived in daze, until he saw Lin Qinhe of Wenhua No.1 High School, a prestigious school thousands of kilometers away, on the remote live broadcast screen of a high school in a poverty-stricken county.\n\nIt was him who lived in the bottom of the well, and for the first time, he caught a glimpse of the moon in the sky.\n\nBut when he exhausted all his energy to climb out of the well and waded towards the moon, he found that the star beside the moon should have been his position.\n\nTao Xi wanted Lin Qinhe, along with the love he lost.>"
