	"description": "On a harsh rainy day, a high school student without any particular special skills, Usato Ken, got dragged into another world summoning with two others; a good-looking guy and a beautiful girl, both of whom he strangely started getting along with just today. As an especially talentless individual that didn’t stand out, he thought that the others would treat him like he was useless. However, they were unexpectedly kind.\n\n———“Maybe things will be fine?”\n\nUsato who found hope in another world thought that, but the reality was different. He had a certain magic talent hidden within him and he was forced to fall into hell under the name of “training”.>"
