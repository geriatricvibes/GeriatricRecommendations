However, the next instant, Hayate is time-leaped to September 1st, from the beginning of summer vacation to when it had already ended!\n\nShirayuki’s true identity is that of a ‘time thief’ who uses her good looks to deceive people and steals their ‘time’ with a mysterious hourglass. Hayate, who had his entire summer vacation stolen from him, decides to challenge her to a fierce psychological warfare to regain his ‘time’ of one month.\n\nIf your heart pounds during your date, then you lose ‘time’ in the ‘time contest game’. ――This is the story of me, regaining my youth after the summer vacation of my first year at high school was stolen.>"
