	"description": "As an author who transmigrated into her own abusive novel, Shi Luo didn’t feel any pressure from it. Besides, it’s not like she transmigrated into the female protagonist who got abused physically and mentally anyway. And so she decided there was nothing she had to do, all she had to do was just to watch it unfold in front of her eyes.\n\nBut this development seems a bit wrong! Wasn’t this supposed to be an abusive novel? How unlucky!>"
