	"description": "She rescued the male lead from a fantasy novel and his sister, who were abused by their uncle, and helped him grew up as an Archwizard to save the world.\n\n“Can I call you Mom? J-just once…”\n\nShe thought in the warmth of the children who called her their mother. No matter what happens, she’ll protect these children.\n\n* * *\n\nShe met a man who was completely different from the nobility she had seen so far in the Southern Tors, where she had escaped safely and settled down.\n\nHe respects people regardless of their status and thinks of others before himself. And, having dreams that he will never achieve.\n\n“Someday, Tors will be strong and rich enough that no one has to worry about their livelihood and their lives. I can’t rest until that day comes.”\n\nShe thought that would be enough if she and the children could live happily ever after.\n\nBut why? She wanted to reach out to the high sky that this man was looking at.\n\n“Your Grace.”\n\nEven if it’s only a few years.\n\n“I’ll help you.”>"
