	"description": "My master tells me that Jiang Hu stands anywhere but the Sword Sect. His words are beyond me. On my commencement, I get my first mission, which is to finish one of my senior fellow disciples.\n\nTN Note: Jiang Hu, literally translates as “Rivers and Lakes”, but figuratively refers to the “underground world of martial arts”. A section of society consisting of martial artists, gangsters, thieves, beggars, prostitutes, merchants, entertainers, and anyone else who wants to operate outside of mainstream society or in the grey area of the law.>"
