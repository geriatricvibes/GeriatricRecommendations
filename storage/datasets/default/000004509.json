	"description": "The heavens and earth change when the blood phoenix descends.\r\n\r\nShe is the chosen one of the blood phoenix, and she shoulders the blood debt of the entire royal clan. She renounces her fair facade with resolution and enthralls the world whilst clad in white, bestirring nations and dynasties with the flip of a hand.\r\n\r\nHe is an invincible war god and never shows mercy in his slaughter. His frozen heart is disturbed by her alone, and his tenderness reserved only for her.\r\n\r\nDo we work together with one heart, or walk the separate paths of strangers? Do we clash against each other with weapons instead…\r\n\r\nIn this vast world, I compose music only with you, to astound eras to come.>"
