	"description": "As a qualified scourge, Chen Yao Yao is assigned two targets by the system.\n\nHer one and ultimate goal is to arouse the targets’ desire to kill each other. \n\nOnce a loving father and son, now all eyes are on her.\n\nBrothers will whole-heartedly fight to death for her affections.\n\nA loyal pair of best friends are now just scapegoats wrapped around her finger.\n\nEven igniting the wrath of the Emperor for a beauty is inevitable.\n\nSoon, the whole world will be wearing her surname.\n\n–\n\nChen Yao Yao said: This is not my thing.\n\nBut… things seem a bit wrong.\n\nIsn’t that a good game?>"
