	"description": "I possessed a dying wife of the male lead with a split personality. I couldn’t even run away because it happened on the day of the wedding.\r\n\r\nBut still, I comforted myself that as long I don’t run into Kid the Killer, I should be able to live somehow.\r\n\r\nAs if laughing at my thoughts,\r\nKid came to see me on the first night.\r\n\r\n“Is that what they call pretending to be asleep? Your acting is pretty good. Now, if you don’t wake up in the count of three—”\r\n\r\n“Eek, I’m awake!”\r\n\r\nHe said that if I wanted to live, I needed to seduce his other personality, the high priest “Seniel”. He said Seniel wouuld keep me alive as long as I became his most prized thing and his weakness.\r\n\r\nBut once I’ve become his weakness, will he spare me? Kidd said he would kill me in due course to step on Seniel.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it’s a matter of dying now or dying later.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Seniel was in tears.\r\n\r\n“It’s all my fault.”\r\n\r\nI kind of comforted him in order to survive. The only way I could live was to pretend to get close to him and run away while he was off guard.\r\n>"
