	"description": "In the endless Universe is eight primordial laws. Each of the eight laws have been fused with a supreme expert, but unbeknownst to everyone, there is a ninth law in the universe. It tears open the Primordial Chaos and is beyond reach.\r\n\r\nDi Jiu—whose name is a homophone for 'ninth'—is the ungifted son of a powerful Di family clan in the Ji Nation as he lacks martial roots. Unwilling to resign to his fate, he practices medicine, hoping to one day cure himself.>"
