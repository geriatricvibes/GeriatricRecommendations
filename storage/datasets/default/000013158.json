	"description": "The alien DNA is the best thing that has ever happened to Ye Shuang because the genetic optimization it offers has made her more beautiful, more formidable, and more brilliant. \n\nBut… why doesn’t this unknown alien species have a fixed s*x before adulthood‽ Alternating between both sexes every few days, why‽ For gender equality‽ Thankfully, she still has a chance to save herself. As long as she can settle down with a partner before full genetic assimilation, she’ll be able to carry on with her life as just one specific sex. For the sake of the perfect female body, all the men out there, beware! \n\nBut wait, what are all these women up to? Why are you all looking at me like a piece of meat‽ Halt, stop, don’t come any closer…! What the hell‽>"
