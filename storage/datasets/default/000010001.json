The original owner was used by the male protagonist’s brother to frame the male lead.\n\nOn the first day of wearing the book, Chi Yi decisively saved the framed male protagonist, then packed up his things and ran back to the entertainment industry.\n\nIt’s just that Chi Yi after entering the book, Chi Yi’s body also lights up a peculiar Koi-physique .\n\nThe TV series he has acted in are all overwhelming.\n\nThe actor who framed him went down.\n\nEven the movie queen who had not been pregnant for many years also became pregnant just because of a word from him.\n\n…\n\nThis is not even counted, the male protagonist with bad luck in the original novel also ushered in luck that he had never had before.\n\nChi Yi, who had never been popular in his previous life, played countless supporting roles, but after entering the book, he reached the top of the entertainment circle with his unparalleled acting skills and good luck.>"
