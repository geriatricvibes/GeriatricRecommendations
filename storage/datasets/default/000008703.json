	"description": "I came here with only the goal of revenge.\r\n\r\nI overthrew the Tulkan Empire, a single nation that dominated the continent.\r\n\r\nI had always succeeded in gaining victory. I had accomplished all I needed to and was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I accepted my approaching death. I no longer had a reason to live.\r\n\r\nAnd so my heart stopped beating.\r\n\r\nI definitely felt it stop.\r\n\r\nHowever, what in the world happened?\r\n\r\n“It’s not black magic and it doesn’t seem like an illusion either.”\r\n\r\nA boy with short, black hair was reflected in the mirror.\r\n\r\nI looked exactly like when I was 14, which was 20 years ago. A young boy, who hasn’t lost his baby fat yet, patted his cheeks and murmured, “How is this possible?”.\r\n\r\nI had returned.\r\n\r\nTo the time filled with my regrets.>"
