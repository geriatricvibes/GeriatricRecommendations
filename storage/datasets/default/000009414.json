	"description": "4th book in Yuan Yuan’s series 老梗也是梗系列之(AKA We were supposed to have died in a plane crash, instead we transmigrated). The stories consist of three modern settings and three historical.\n\n—\n\nHow can her luck be a “match”?\n\nShe decided to say goodbye to the past and start again, but she encountered a plane crash by accident. Even more surprising is — she didn’t die.\n\nAnd her soul still “borrowed” the body of another person!\n\nHaha, this time she really got a “new life”.\n\nThe original owner of this “new body” also coincidently has the same name as her.\n\nAnd ah, by her previous self, she used to be a delicate, stunning person and a big beautiful woman.\n\nNow she has a head of curly hair plus a round face.\n\nLiving as an oriental doll, in school campus just popular as much!\n\nHowever, although there are pursuers in long line queues\n\nBut there’s always a man living in her heart…\n\nMaybe the god of destiny heard the voice in her heart\n\nActually allowed him to meet her and also started a strong and fierce pursuit of her “new life”!\n\nJust… she thought that she destroyed his happiness at the beginning.\n\nNow, it’s time for her to pay back her debts…>"
