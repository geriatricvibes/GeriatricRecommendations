	"description": "I was happy to be a stepmother to my beloved friend’s family.\r\n\r\nThere was only a husband that’s constantly preoccupied and two stepsons that avoided me whenever they could\r\n\r\nAfter seven years, I left them.\r\n\r\nThe moment I realized my artistic talent and tried to live a new life, two new men appeared in front of me.\r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\n'You left without a word, and you were here.'\r\n\r\n...They came to me.\r\n>"
