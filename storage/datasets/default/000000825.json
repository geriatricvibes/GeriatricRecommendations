	"description": "“Are the novel Gods punishing me because I left a bad review?!”\r\n\r\nShen Ziqiao woke up from her deep slumber to find herself transmigrated as the character of an ancient novel. To make matters even worse, she was written by the author to be the moronic daughter of the villain, merely a walking cannon fodder.\r\n\r\nYet it doesn’t end there; she has to strive against a reincarnated female lead's revenge!
