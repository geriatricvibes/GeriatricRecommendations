	"description": "In the shade of the dark forest, a beautiful oriental maiden with a troubled expression sighs to herself.\n\n“Why did I forget…? No, I guess I wanted to forget. He’s finally here; that harem eroge protagonist…”\n\nー\n\nSaitou Chie has a childhood friend that has always been the stereotypical manga protagonist. Because of that, she is constantly annoyed by his “fan club.” She isn’t even surprised when he is summoned to a fantasy world and wishes him luck when he suddenly grabs her yelling “Then you come too!!” and pulls her in with him. Now her body has been destroyed because it wasn’t meant to go through the summoning and a God is saying “I will give you a new body…”>"
