	"description": "There was a magical blacksmith in the cultivation world, every piece of artifact that it forges captivated and even tipped the scale of balance of the world. \r\n\r\nMany cultivators waited at its door for months and even years just so they could get their hands on the scraps that the blacksmith throws out. \r\n\r\nAs for those who were able to get a request from the blacksmith, their lives changed drastically with items they got from the blacksmith. Despite the astronomical price that the blacksmith charges, it was a small cost to pay if the item could change their fates. \r\n\r\nHowever, the more the blacksmith forges, the deeper he plunged into a whirlpool of matters in the cultivation world. Can the blacksmith change not only the fate of others but also his own? \r\n\r\n>"
