	"description": "\r\n\r\n“You taught me. There is no flower that does not wither.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLily, the only daughter of a fallen Baron.\r\n\r\nBorn with a prophecy of a curse, Lily was promised her father's title in return for offering her purity to the emperor. However, after witnessing the emperor committed murder on the first night, she fled in fear, and the emperor freed the hounds and went hunting...\r\n\r\n‘How about taming it?’\r\n\r\nThe emperor had a strange sense of déjà vu as he left the captured and defiant Lily behind.  \r\n\r\n“Those arrogant eyes beg me.  \r\nThe lustful lips call out my name.  \r\nThe pale skin yearns for me.  \r\nWhat If I become your everything that you've rejected so much.' \r\n\r\nThe emperor made an impulsive decision to keep Lily by his side. But Lily's thirst for freedom was unquenchable, and as he repeatedly chased and let her go, immature feelings began to develop in the unconscious mind.\r\n\r\nLooking back, he realized that it was love, but Lily had already left.\r\n\r\n“I'll be waiting. My eternal flower.”\r\n\r\nAlthough he vowed to wait forever and hoped for her salvation, they were too far apart to turn around.\r\n>"
