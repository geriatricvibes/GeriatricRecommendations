	"description": "Kurt was born to a poor Baronetcy of Arnold. He was a genius pastry chef in the previous world.\n\nWhile increasing the wealth of his fief as the feudal lord, he aims for his past unfulfilled dream, to become the greatest pastry chef in the world. Making honey, building orchards with elves, trading, he gathers ingredients for his pastries, those which give a whole new taste never seen before in the different world…\n\nHuge profit from selling special products, extremely high praise from the ducal house as temporary pâtissier, the shop that he builds in the capital city becoming a big hit!\n\nThis is a sweet tale of pastries and being surrounded by kind people.>"
