	"description": "There was an unwritten rule in the ballet world: If the male or female dancer is too nervous before getting on stage, they’ll need their partner’s help to reach their org*sm once to make the body soft. Only then will they have an amazing performance.\n\nEvery time before Bai Zhi’s performance or competition starts, the one who responsible for ‘making her tight body soft’, was her mentor, Chen Liu.\n\nAs he did it, she not even lost her body, but also her heart. Dancing academy’s sweet and tender new student X ballet department’s choreography mentor.\n\nNote: The rule of making their partner's body 'soft' is entirely fictional and has nothing to do with how things are done in real life. I've added this rule into the story based on a random post I'd read online.>"
