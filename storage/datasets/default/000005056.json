	"description": "Zhong Yi was invited as a visiting professor, Zhang Xingzhi was late for the first day of work…\n\nHe looked at the new teacher as he entered and said that he was late and ended up  sitting in the first row and he heard him say:\n\n “You, don’t leave after class.”\n\nThe whole class went silent, and everyone turned their attention to their original professional teacher who was occupying the first row. One thing was inevitable.\n\nUntil later, the new teacher arranged classwork: He asked them to send a picture that they thought was the best.\n\nThe children were about to start looking, when they heard their professional teacher ask, “What about me?”\n\nThe class calmed down again.\n\nZhong Yi raised an eyebrow: “You send it, I’ll take a look.”\n\nAll eyes looked down, as he took his phone out and pressed the shutter and took a picture of the person on the podium.\n\nThe whole class:  “???”\n\n[f*ck, even if you love the new teacher and don’t love Dean Jiang, why are you still doing a big dull job and robbing us of our only perfect answer! ]>"
