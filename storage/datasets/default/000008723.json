	"description": "Right when Drako Yau, the chairman and game designer of a game company, is about to release the open beta of the game which he has been developing for years, things go awry. Another company suddenly launches a game which can be played using the brainwave technology, Real World. The map, background, game mechanics, and many more; everything is almost identical to the game he has designed.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity and bitterness, he enters the game, only to find that he cannot log out of it. He has to struggle in what seems to be a game, with his life on the line.>"
