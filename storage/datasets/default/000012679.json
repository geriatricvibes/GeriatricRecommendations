	"description": "Lin HuanHuan never expected to be transmigrated while she was soaking in the bath!\n\nFine, so be it if she really had transmigrated, but what was up with having her tranmigrate into a beast world?!\n\nHandsome beastmen were walking around everywhere, wearing only an animal skin skirt and revealing their big long legs!\n\nWhat? They also want her to give birth to cubs?!\n\nNONONO! Interracial love never ends well. Extremely lovingly (quickly),¹ let me go!\n\n¹TN: Pun on the words ‘extremely lovingly’ (ku ai). It has the same pronounciation as ‘quickly’ (kuai) but broken up into two words.>"
