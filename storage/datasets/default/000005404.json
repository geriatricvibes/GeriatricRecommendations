Because of an unexpected event, a quick transmigration system bonds with him. From then on, he transmigrates through various worlds one by one, especially smacking the faces of all the self-centered scum men and the manipulative two-faced women in these worlds.\n \nIf you have 100 reasons to give me crap, then I too have 10,000 ways to break up with you.>"
