	"description": "Skyler was raised by village chief as his son. Due to an attack against the village by monsters brings out his powers for the first time and is scouted to become a Dragon Knight. Due to his heritage, he is stronger than a normal human and he bonds quickly with his dragon.\n\nThe Dragon Knights are in three different factions. The nobles have personal dragons who they are raised beside at birth who have long lineages and strong powers. Unless gifted a dragon by a noble, one must hunt for a wild dragon and tame it as part of the training. Depending on what kind of dragon they tame, they will be assigned to one of the three Knight groups.\n\nThere are two kinds of dragons, elemental dragon with the characteristic of water, earth, wind, and fire. Metal dragon with the attribute of iron, silver, gold, and platinum. Dragons of the Metal class are considered stronger, and depending on what dragon they get, theyâ€™ll be put into different sub group within the three Knight factions (example wind dragon= wind corps).\n\nSkyler has an easy time with dragons and tames a platinum dragon which is considered the strongest dragon but by taming a dragon the same as three royal families he draws unsavory eyes.>"
