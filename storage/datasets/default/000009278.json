	"description": "The series follows the protagonist Kazunari Hira, a high school student who doesn’t talk much, has no friends, and belongs to the bottom of his class. The person he falls in love with at first sight is Sou Kiyoi. He is “The King” who doesn’t hang out with anyone, equally ruthless, and reigns at the top of the class. With the hope Sou will notice his presence, Kazunari serves him devotedly, running errands and buying lunch. But his faith in the absolute monarch gradually falls into lust.\n\nVolume 1 – Utsukushii Kare\n\nVolume 2 – Nikurashii Kare\n\nVolume 3 - Nayamashii Kare >"
