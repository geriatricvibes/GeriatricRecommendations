	"description": "The second prince got a woman with child and broke off the engagement he had with me. Ours wasn’t a love match to begin with, and I couldn’t even claim to feel angry or sad at the news. Despite that, it would seem I was still owed an apology. But why was one who brought it the older brother of my ex-fiance, the crown prince himself?\n\n[Crown Prince x Son of a Poor Noble / BL / R18]>"
