	"description": "The Oracle’s Saint was fake, and the fake deserved to be expelled from the sacred temple.\n\nIn front of the fragile being who fell into the world without any protection, the first prince of the empire appeared and reached out. She had to hold his hands.\n\n“You don’t have to worry about anything. I’ll take care of you.”\n\nNot knowing that the affectionate man was having thoughts, blinking his eyes and imagining her spreading her legs.\n\n—\n\nI thought it was somewhat strange . When everything collapsed and abandoned her, He appeared as if it had all been organized.\n\n“Why do you keep crying, Dear Saint?”\n\n“….”\n\n“I’m not saying I’m going to kill you.”\n\nThe maniac who desires to possess and swallow her all.>"
