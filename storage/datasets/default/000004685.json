	"description": "Qin Jue, the Asian server’s No.1 sprayer with a dirty mouth and swarms of black fans, always had a high ranking but he refuses to be invited by all the big teams and never shows up on offline matches.\n\nUntil one day, Qin Jue met the main sniper of Team IS, Qi Ji, who was like a jade tree.\n\n–Qin Jue suddenly felt very hot, then he thoroughly tried to cool himself down.\n\nEven though he was bullied to the point of no return, Qin Jue felt that he still had his domineering spirit: “Obviously I want to have fun with you, to teach you that there is true love on earth and what love means~ Look, I’m not blushing?”\n\nHowever, no matter how much he rambled, Qi Ji only slightly closed his eyes, and gave him a tender kiss on the cheek – “However senior, you’re red now.”>"
