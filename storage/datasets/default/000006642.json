	"description": "A sudden and terrible disaster had struck, completely changing the environment of Earth as they knew it. Plenty of Source Energy spread and opened a path for biological evolution, one that brought superior human beings out of a race on the brink of extinction.\n\nThis is the resurgence of a glorious ancient cultivating civilization, where development of science and technology was no longer the theme of daily life. The use of martial arts was no longer a legend, but a must to evolve and to survive.\n\nIt is the worst era of natural selection, survival of the fittest; your life at stake.\n\nThis is one of the best eras, where the strong have gathered, heroes have risen, and transcendence is not just a dream.\n\nHere, a lonely orphan, left by his parents, is where the legend begins!>"
