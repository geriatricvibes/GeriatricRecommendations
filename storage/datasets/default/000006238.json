	"description": " Wen Yu had a dream after his eighteenth birthday. In the dream, he was lying on the cold stone altar with his hands and feet tied up, his surroundings were dark and gloomy. Vaguely, he saw a dark figure approaching him step by step. After waking up from the dream, a series of strange things began to happen around him.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a huge sum of money in his account, which was so large that he doubted his counting ability. After that, the punk who was bullying him was beaten into the hospital by someone unknown. From then on, whenever they see him, they would flee as if they had seen a ghost. The relatives who adopted him suddenly started to be warm and concerned about him. Later, he somehow got a real estate certificate under his name, the address is in the famous rich villa area of S City.\r\n\r\nOn the night after moving, inside the big house, he was suddenly tied up with invisible ropes. When he fell on the cold floor, he saw a dark figure walking towards him step by step. It was like the dream that night. It's just that this time, he clearly saw the appearance of the shadow, an extremely handsome and extremely gloomy man.\r\n>"
