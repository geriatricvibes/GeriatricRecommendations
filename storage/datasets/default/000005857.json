	"description": "A University student, Shouma Hanashima, unexpectedly came to be able to see strange apparitions. As this new obstacle shows up and Shouma becomes unable to attend lectures and work at his part-time job, he visits a suspicious detective agency with an inscription on its front, which says ‘Mysterious phenomenons? I will help you with anything’.\r\n\r\nThe head of the office is Tendou, a good looking man with a somewhat dubious impression.\r\n\r\nShouma gets an offer from Tendou, who explains that the true identity of these strange phenomenons are called the ‘kaii’ and that he could make a protection charm for Shouma, along with an invitation from the man to work and assist him.\r\n\r\nIt seems Tendou wants to find and put back the yokai into a book they accidentally escaped from, which he calls ‘The Collected Records’.\r\n\r\nTogether with Tendou and his collected yokai, Shouma gets dragged into strange incidents.>"
