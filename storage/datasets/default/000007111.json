	"description": "[If you enter the deep forest, you will be eaten by the shadows.\n\nThe shadows of the forest move when a person is not looking.\n\nThere is a shadow that mimics people in the deep forest.\n\nThe shadow of the forest speaks.]\n\nRosaline, of the Knights of the White Night, had gone missing after being attacked by enemy forces during a hunting contest.\n\nHowever, she was found unconscious, badly injured, and lying beneath the cliff.\n\nRosaline, who woke up a few days later, seemed to have severe memory loss. It was difficult for her to speak even simple words.\n\nShe was found walking barefoot, in her pajamas, talking informally here and there. She would even pick up food off the floor!\n\nShe’s a strange girl no matter how you look at her. Is that really Rosaline?>"
