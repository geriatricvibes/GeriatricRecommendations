	"description": "1. A friend asked Chen Yao, “When did you like Jinxiu?”\r\n\r\nChen Yao looked at Jinxiu’s back and smiled knowingly, “Because of a bowl of dumplings.”\r\n\r\nThe friend suddenly realized, “It turns out that you found a potential wife!”\r\n\r\nChen Yao lowered his head, his dark eyes warmed a bit. Because in his hunger and despair, Jinxiu brought him a ray of sunshine, warm and full of energy.\r\n\r\n2. Jinxiu’s best friend asked her, “When did you like Chen Yao?”\r\n\r\nJinxiu smiled slightly, revealing the deep dimples at the corners of her mouth, “Because when everyone is standing opposite me, only he puts me behind him.”\r\n\r\nJinxiu would never forget the man holding a shovel in front of her while glaring at everyone, he guarded her behind him and said to her gently, “Don’t be afraid, I am here.”>"
