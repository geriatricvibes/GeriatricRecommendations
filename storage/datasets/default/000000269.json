	"description": "One year, after she transmigrates to the Matriarchy World, she meets a young man with an umbrella under the cherry blossoms. With warm and beautiful eyes, he says to her with a red face and lowered eyes.\n'May Your Highness always stay safe, happy, and victorious.'\n\nAnother year, after she transmigrates to the Doomsday World, zombies fill the city and she meets him again. A beautiful and fair person raises his grayish-white eyes and smiles at her. 'Don't be afraid, I will protect you.'\n\nIn another year, when she transmigrates to the world of Star Wars...Ah! She meets him again! A slender and tall young man droops his long eyelashes and adjusts his collar button before slowly saying, 'Where are you planning to hide this time?'\n\nYun Xia: 'There's no other place to hide so I'm borrowing your house as my hideout.'>"
