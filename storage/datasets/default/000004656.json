	"description": "Yan Chen, an overly obsessive wolf and possessive lover, chained Rong Jun who wanted to run away from him. He imprisoned him, not hesitating to abolish his feet to keep him by his side. It was all tragic before his reincarnation.\r\n\r\nAfter being reincarnated, a certain wolf followed behind the proud white peacock, restraining his selfish desires and guarding him carefully. Not to mention that his white peacock ran away. He was so distressed that he wanted to engrave his name on his neck and marry him to keep him from ever leaving him!>"
