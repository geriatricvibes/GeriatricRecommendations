	"description": "Why’d Shakespeare have to name the main character in the play Juliet? Life would’ve been so much smoother if the title of that damn tragedy was Romeo and Britney!\n\nJuliet Holiday, a high school student in Kansas, was a bit annoyed by her unusual name, but her day was going as it usually does…\n\n“Hi, nice to meet you. I am Romeo.”\n\nUntil he transferred in.\n\nFrom the fatefully-named Romeo Buchannon, to football team quarterback Grey Holt, to childhood friend Luke Theobold…\n\nJuliet’s constantly changing relationships are changing her school life in a not so constant way.>"
