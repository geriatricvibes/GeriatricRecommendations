	"description": "Most people in Lu Group feel that President Lu Xiao has a strict wife.\n\nGeneral Manager Lu kept low. Whenever his wife, Ye Cheng, came to the company to check the accounts, he was more respectful than welcoming his father.​​\n\nIn the interviews with reporters, Ye Cheng repeatedly complained about his lover.\n\n“I hope he quits drinking.”\n\n“Do not smoke and don’t snore when he sleeps.”\n\n“If I can go back to when he was young, I will surely help with correcting his bad habits.” Ye Cheng said politely to the camera.>"
