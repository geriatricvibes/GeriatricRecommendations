	"description": "Only after Empress Lizzie died did Emperor Leon realize his foolishness and regret it late, but the clock had already passed.\r\n\r\nWith Leon's wishes, the Witch of the Clock Tower turned back time to the day Leon first met Empress Lizzie, and all that was left for Leon, who had returned to the past, was to make Lizzie happy.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of turning back time was greater than he thought. Will Leon be able to make Lizzie happy?\r\n>"
