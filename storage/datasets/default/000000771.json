	"description": "Having witnessed her boyfriend cheating on her with her bestie, she promptly made him her ex and, on the rebound, married a handsome, young billionaire. In public, he was a dazzling, wealthy scion, a brilliant young entrepreneur. Away from the public eye, he was the perfect husband: highly educated and able to hold his own in any situation, and just as adept as a cook and with housework. Unhappily, she protested, “Tonight, you should sleep on the couch, I will take the bed.” \r\n\r\n>"
