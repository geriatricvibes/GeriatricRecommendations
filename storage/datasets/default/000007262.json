	"description": "She crossed into another world one day, it was forced, but she endured! Three months later, her belly largened, she admitted it! Six months later, she laid an egg, and she completely panicked!\r\n\r\nBut ever since she laid that egg, she had been robbed, poisoned, chased, and at the end, she stepped onto an endless journey of hiding. She even concealed herself in her own storage space. Not only did those people want the egg, they want her life, and they even want the space!\r\n\r\nIf she could endure that, what else could she not endure? If one comes, poison one. If two comes, poison a pair!\r\n\r\nFinally, on the day when a certain egg broke its shell, an organism which came to “spread seeds” appeared, and it actually stared at her with a face of dislike, “So you’re the woman who will extend this king’s bloodline?”\r\n\r\nShe was finally enraged! Even if it was an incomparably arrogant divine dragon, she was going to poison it into a cute and obedient little insect!>"
