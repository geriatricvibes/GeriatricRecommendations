	"description": "Another World × Elf × Supermarket = I am the shopkeeper. The “shopkeeper” who “quit” that stress-filled reality and casually disappeared into another world.\r\n\r\nI want to repay the kindness of the people in that other world! With an elf who I found collapsed on the road to help at the register, I, the shopkeeper, opened a small shop. The goods I have lined up are from modern society! Sugar and coffee, chainsaws, and plastic bags, today we’ll sell all we can!\r\n\r\nOur another-world C-mart is full of customers, ranging from our neighbor “oba-chan” to children to dwarf smiths and even legendary adventurers!?\r\n\r\nIn my relaxed, slow life as shopkeeper, with a carefree attitude we’re open for business today as well!>"
