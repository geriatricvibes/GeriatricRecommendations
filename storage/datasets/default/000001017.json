	"description": "Huan Xiu transmigrated to the Zerg planet and decided to start his new life.\n\nHe happened to hear that a cub near the college had been bullied. It seemed that the reason was that the ‘female’ father of the cub was injured in the war and retreated to the rear line and now his future was hopeless. For various reasons, the cub was brutally expelled from the school.\n\nAs a sensational gossip, Huan Xiu didn’t think that the other party was the man who helped him when he first came to the world – and he was recommended to be his ‘female’ concubine under the malicious arrangement of others.>"
