However, just like a sandcastle on the beach, the iron castle he built collapsed at the hands of only one person, Shin Heejae.\r\n\r\nSeyoung ended up selling his account at a bargain price and vowed never to set foot in this game again but… A year later, he opened a new account and connected to [Arcadia] again.\r\n\r\nBy some stroke of luck, he runs into Shin Heejae again and this time, he decides to catfish him with a female character, swindle him of his resources and quit the game as the ultimate revenge.>"
