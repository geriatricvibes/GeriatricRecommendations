	"description": "Yu Qing Yao is a pseudo-white lotus, a real green tea b*tch. She’s a witch, an actress, a bad girl. Reborn to a terrible ancient world like the Liao Zhai, and embarking on the path of cultivation. Her life’s ambition is to be the white moonlight in the eyes of all men and the softest cinnabar mark in their hearts.\n\nLi Huaide is a cultivating genius. His life’s ambition is to marry Yu Qing Yao as his wife, even if he has to go through a hundred deaths, he has no regrets. But then he was really killed a hundred times by Yu Qing Yao.\n\nHis long pursuit of his wife’s road is so bumpy that its an inch of heartache and blood.\n\nWill he ever hold the beauty?\n\nNote : White lotus- A person who pretends to be kind and innocent.\n\nGreen tea b*tch- A beautiful and innocent young woman who is actually very calculating. A woman who uses rich and powerful men for personal gain.>"
