	"description": "After thousands of years of silence, the world of cultivation once again welcomed the golden age.\n\nWhile the prodigies and sects’ various disciples in the world competed, Zhou Feng had only a skill panel. And the panel would only give him passive skills.\n\nGluttony: When you digest food, you can digest it faster and better. You will also get hungry faster.\n\nStrength: When you are not fighting, you will slowly regain 1% of your health.\n\nBlade-Sharpening Rock: You will gain 1 point every time you fight.\n\nAge Gracefully: Every year you live, you gain Defense +1.\n\nArmor: You will have an armor of a certain ratio every time you attack.\n\nDao Seeds: Increase of 1% to your familiarity with cultivating the Dao.\n\n…\n\n“All sorts of passive skills are vested within me. I cultivate passively!”\n\n“As long as I can live until the end, then I will become the strongest!”>"
