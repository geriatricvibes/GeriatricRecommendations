	"description": "Bird Three traveled every corner of the land to search for traces of the ancestral ruins and ways to survive. Using wisdom and talent, he defeated competitors such as the royals of the four dynasties, the guardians of the four families, and assassins behind the ruins. It was a journey with no return and no turning back—a life and death battle with betrayals by one’s dearest friends, and a battle between justice and evil, loyalty and faith!>"
