	"description": "In this world, there existed a demon king. Inside one of the two major nations, the king of the Athena Empire invited a hero to go subjugate the demon king.\n\nSensing the movement of the hero’s party, the demon king got a little angry.\n\nEven though I’m diligently managing my country, why do I have to be subjugated? I don’t understand the reasoning.\n\nAnd also I got a question for the Hero and his party. Why is the hero the commander for the Athena royal army? Why didn’t the top brass come? And also why is everyone, other than the hero, female? is it a harem? – So absurd.\n\nAnd so, the demon king made a decision.\n\nIf the hero comes, I’m going to harass the heck out of him –\n\nFor the gallant hero headed to subjugate the demon king, and the dissatisfied demon king who lied in wait for the hero, soon their fated (love) will begin.>"
