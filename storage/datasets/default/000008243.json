	"description": "'Uhm.....could we rent this DVD together?' Itou Daijirou, who attends an all-boys high school, visits a rental video store late one night. There, he's 'hit on' by a lone girl. From this event, the two become friends. Daijirou is having fun, but feels dissatisfied that they can only ever meet at night for a short time. Actually, he gets another weird feeling too. Mysterious phenomena happen when he's with her, like objects that move and break without being touched. In truth, the girl – Haijima Koharu – awakened special powers when she was young. And along with other girls who also awakened their powers, she's being kept isolated from society – an esper who lives her life in a research facility. She slips out of the facility night after night, enjoying her secret adventures in town. However, some of her classmates find out what she's up to, and things develop from there...\r\nA boy-meets-psychic-girl, youthful love comedy!>"
