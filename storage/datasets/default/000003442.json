	"description": "Adopted by a villain family, she possessed the heroine who was only harassed and exploited.\r\n\r\nThe life of an orphan again, in reality.\r\n\r\n‘It’s just me. I am the only one who protects me.’\r\n\r\nShe planned to persistently survive the den of villains and run away when she became an adult.\r\n\r\nBut⋯⋯.\r\n\r\n“Freddia, if you want anything, your father will get it for you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not really what I want, but you can call me ‘unnie’ too. It’s annoying to call for you to call my father ‘father’ while you call me a princess.” \r\n\r\n“How can you be so good at everything, baby?”\r\n\r\nA father who bursts into laughter whenever she speaks, an older sister who takes care of Freddia’s craftsmanship, she wants to be cold-hearted, and a mother who is attacked by Fredia’s dexterity.\r\n\r\n‘Do I have to run away?’>"
