	"description": "Arendine is a reincarnator who died miserably in her past life.\r\n\r\n“I’ll live a full life this time around!” I vowed. However, an eight-year-old Grand Duke won’t stop disturbing my peaceful life.\r\n\r\nUnable to deal with that jerk any longer, I was forced to take drastic measures by slapping him. At first, he was absolutely livid, ordering me to be whipped. But after that whole incident blew over, his reaction was... A little strange.\r\n\r\n“I’ll let you hit me from now on. You can hit me as much as you want.”\r\n\r\nWhy is he blushing and talking nonsense?\r\n\r\nI seem to have awakened his secret taste! Gotta get rid of this guy ASAP!>"
