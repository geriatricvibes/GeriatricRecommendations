The Second Commander of the Jiejian Bureau, Feng Xiao came forth to investigate the case under Imperial Orders.\n\nA gathering of storms would soon take place in a little city which sat on the frontier, called the City of Six Crafts, where all the top martial powers across the lands would meet.\n\nThe ever successful Second Commander Feng meets a dead end when he ran into a Master Daoist with ailing health.\n\nAll would be unknown if they had never crossed paths, but once their paths crossed, Second Commander Feng realized this ailing man had more secrets than himself.>"
