	"description": "The entire entertainment circle knew that whenever leading actress Du Yu Shu and Emperor Ye Jingan encountered each other, in their free time they would speak with poison on their tongues and release gunpowder all around them in the air-ready to destroy, their poor relationship was to the point where fans from both sides had already given up on fighting with each other.\n\nBut no one knew that Du Yu Shu was actually a very big fan of Ye Jingan, every day she would go online and praise him #bow to male god, #male god is very handsome, #male god I want to give birth to a little monkey with you, #give birth a flower goddess # fan in true love;\n\nAt the same time, no one knew that Ye Jingan was Du Yu Shu’s fan, every day he would go online and worship her #goddess, #please marry me goddess, #seeking to support the goddess, #I’ll kneel so please look at me goddess #this is true love ;\n\nUntil one day, they both entered into the same entertainment variety show- causing the entire entertainment circle to go mad, though it was a very delightful spectacle to watch, one day, they fell off a horse.\n\n—I heard you like me?\n\n—So?\n\n—Well I like you,\n\n—I like you too.>"
