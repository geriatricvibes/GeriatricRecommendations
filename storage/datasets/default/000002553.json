	"description": "There was an old story that circulated for quite a long time, a story that happened in the City of Maretilin, about two necromancers and a hero who conquered them, a wandering magician named Leder. After the story, though no such record supported it, there really was a magician named Leder who passed the magicians’ tests. All the magician organizations on the grand land, from the Necromancers’ Union in the south to the Tower of The Wise in the north, agreed that Leder was the most powerful magician in history. They called him “The Grand Wise.”>"
