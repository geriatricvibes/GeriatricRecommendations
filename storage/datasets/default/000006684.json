	"description": "I helped the warriors who couldn’t reach the dragon, and we became true companions beyond life and death.\n\nSo I believed.\n\nBut it was my own delusion.\n\nIt was impossible for me to join in that place of honor where everyone cheered. As a commoner, I couldn’t stand among the group of warriors composed only of those of noble origins. \n\nAs such, I left the capital city by myself, and the dragon I thought was asleep, awakened once more.\n\n*      *      *\n\n“Cornelia.”\n\nA man’s shining, cream-colored eyes looked at me pathetically.\n\n“Please come back, we’re comrades.”\n\nBehind him, the group nodded at his words. Everyone clung to and depended on me. \n\nThose who had climbed to the highest position were on their knees in front of me, the one in the lowest position.\n\nMy gaze reached the man at the back who was gnawing his lips. The man said nothing. He was just staring at me with a pathetic expression on his face.\n\nLooking at them, I smiled brightly.\n\nExcept for one person, their faces brightened in an instant.\n\n“Mmh, I’m not going back.”\n\nI shut the door roughly on the Empire’s heroes.>"
