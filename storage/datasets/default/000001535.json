	"description": "When he was in elementary school, Shota Ishikawa was a “popular kid with a good face, who could study and exercise well,” but by the time he graduated from junior high school, everyone around him was calling him an a**hole. Shota didn’t mean to do anything wrong, but his classmates, childhood friends, best friends, and family all didn’t believe him. Now in high school, Shota hides his face, cuts back on his physical activities, and tries to live a quiet high school life.>"
