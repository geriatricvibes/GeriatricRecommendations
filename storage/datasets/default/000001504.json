	"description": "Jiang Fan had transmigrated to a world where everyone could awaken a planet.\n\nThe larger the planet, the higher the origin energy, and the stronger the civilization.\n\nThere were people who made theirs with qi to create a martial arts civilization. Everyone on the planet was a martial arts practitioner.\n\nThere were people who made theirs with magic power to create a magical civilization. Everyone on the planet was a mage.\n\nThere were people who made their spiritual energy to create an immortal civilization. Everyone on the planet was an immortal cultivator.\n\nEveryone was trying their best to construct all sorts of extraordinary planets.\n\nJiang Fan, on the other hand, used his memories from his previous life to create a technological civilization!\n\n“Your Star Destroyer directly pierced through the opponent’s planet, and the opponent lowered their head.”\n\n“Your two-way foil turned the opponent’s immortal cultivation planet into a piece of paper. You scared them silly!”>"
