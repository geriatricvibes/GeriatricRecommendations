	"description": "Today, I am getting married for the second time to my husband, as the daughter of the imperial family he hates.\n\nPretending to be good, pretending to be weak, pretending to be poor.\n\nI possessed the villainess Gabriella Nashert, a villainess who possesses the ‘three-piece combo’ that enrages the readers. \n\nSo I decided to not be a villain. \n\n‘The original? Who cares? Let’s push it with a tank.’ \n\nThat’s why I proposed to a man unrelated to the original novel for a contract marriage, and left the place where the original plot took place. \n\nThe three years I spent with my husband was quite sweet. \n\nEven though it ended with my death.\n\nHowever, when I woke up again, I found out that I became the daughter of the family who’s responsible for my death? \n\nI’m also known to be an idiot who is threatened by my blood-related brothers, Peony Hualen Isodeim! \n\nFor once, I have to pretend to be innocent in order to survive. But is it because I lived as a villain in the original story? It’s so easy to raise other people’s blood pressure with my immature acting, so I feel a little embarrassed. \n\n‘How can I be so natural…?’>"
