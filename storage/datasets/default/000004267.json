	"description": "'He's not your husband, he's mine.' A wedding invitation came from a friend of 10 years. The moment I saw the picture, my heart dropped. Because it was none other than my husband who held the friend's hand affectionately.... \r\n\r\nOne day, when I could no longer endure the pain of betrayal and even lived as if I was dead mouse with a new name, I got into an unexpected accident and was transported into a devastating novel. \r\n\r\nBy the way.... Why did you get transported too? I was reunited with the friend who pushed my life into hell and took away my husband. In this beggar like wretched novel. I will no longer live my life as a loser.>"
