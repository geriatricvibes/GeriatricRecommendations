	"description": "As a system that is very spicy, it is actually bound by the Lord God to a host that is an even spicier chicken!\n\nThe system said ruthlessly: I don’t want to live!\n\nUnexpectedly, the host actually promises to make it the master of the plane and the most powerful!\n\nThe System: Well, I will believe in you this time. I want to become the master of the plane!\n\nHowever, why does the host destroy every plane that she disagrees with?!\n\nDid you want to ruin me and still make me the main god of the plane?\n\nXi Ying: I don’t like this world, but I like you. Since you like this world, then I will leave it for you.\n\n辣雞 [là jī]: Spicy chicken. This Internet slang term is a humorous way of saying 垃圾 [lā ji] “tr*sh, douchebags, contemptible people.”>"
