	"description": "Most royal marriages are set up when the couple is young, and the fiancée is chosen for political reasons. The couple stays together unless there is a big problem.\r\n\r\nBut in the Kingdom of Catalonia, the royalty selects their partners and announces them, along with their future entourage, at the Royal Academy graduation ceremony.\r\n\r\nOther countries' royal families envy this system because it allows them to choose the partner they want.\r\n\r\nAlthough the system is well-liked by the other countries' royal families, there is one person who is not pleased: Catalonia's first prince, Cyril.\r\n\r\nHe's tall and fearless, with blond hair and blue eyes. Outstanding academic achievements. He is a promising next king, surrounded by sons and daughters of the high nobility, all with a glazed look in their eyes, saying 'I want to be queen' or 'I want to be a close aide.'\r\n\r\nThis made Cyril's school life extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nHis brother Luke was wondering if there was anything he could do to assist.\r\nThen an idea struck Luke.\r\n\r\nA crazy idea, but if it works, it will solve Cyril's problems once and for all.\r\n\r\nWith a grin, he said.\r\n\r\n'Brother—I have an idea!>"
