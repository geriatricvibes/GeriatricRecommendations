	"description": "Chi Yan had always had a weak constitution, and ghosts had always tried to kill him. He had tried many ways to change his situation, but it was all futile.\n\nCoincidentally, Third Master Ye of Shiming City passed away, and a priest informed Chi Yan that Third Master Ye possessed the “look of demon,”  Carrying a bit of this man’s ashes and installing an altar for him at home could help control the evil spirits around Chi Yan.\n\nLeft with no choice, Chi Yan took a gamble. Amazingly, it worked. However he didn’t expect to instead be haunted by the most persistent ghost of them all.\n\nObsessed with love, undying resentment, possessed by evil.>"
