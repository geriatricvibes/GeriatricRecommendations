	"description": "Despite being born into a family that practiced Daoism through many generations, Lin You naturally didn’t like learning about Daoism. Unfortunately for him, it was confirmed through a divination that he would not live past the age of twenty-five. From that point on, he hid himself near that tyrant who had killed him with a car. \r\n\r\nHe used all sorts of methods to make his existence known. \r\n\r\nHe turned into a macaw, then a guinea pig, then a lynx, and then a husky. He changed into different bodies with no end. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his relationship with Mu Yanxiao deepened with each change. >"
