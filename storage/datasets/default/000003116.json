	"description": "'Ruin Ardell.'\r\n\r\nThe name that was enrolled into the academy with the best grades.\r\nMore promising than anyone else.\r\nMore dilligent than anyone else.\r\nMore talented than any other magician. That's what my name meant.\r\nThat's what it meant...\r\nuntil my 10th birthday.\r\nI had received a death sentence.\r\n\r\n'Magic Evocation Disorder.'\r\n\r\nA damned curse that turned the 'Magic Genius' that entered the academy with the highest grades into a 'Magic Cripple'.\r\nBut then,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA miracle found me.\r\n\r\n'If I can't evoke magic, I just need to punch them!'\r\n\r\nOppressive Strength, Fearsome Fists, A Genius Magic Talent.\r\nI'll never lose to anyone ever again.>"
