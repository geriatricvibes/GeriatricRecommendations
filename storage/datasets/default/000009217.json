	"description": "Poison Doctor Gu Qingyin found the gravely injured and amnesiac Leader of the Demonic Path, Zhong Shujin, at the bottom of a cliff. After all the trouble she took to heal the idiotic amnesiac leader and restore her intelligence, who also conveniently ate her clean without taking responsibility, the memory-restored leader ran away without a word.\r\n\r\nSince then, Gu Qingyin had set foot on an endless bumpy road in pursuit of her wife.\r\n\r\nZhong Shujin: “The injury is on my arm, why are you taking off my clothes…”\r\n\r\nGu Qingyin: “Checking for other injuries on your body.”\r\n\r\nZhong Shujin: “Well… But! Your hand! Why are you touching everywhere!”\r\n\r\nGu Qingyin: “……Checking for wounds.”\r\n\r\nZhong Shujin: “Oh… Your mouth… Where are you kissing!”\r\n\r\nGu Qingyin: “Hey… I’ve cleared out the poison for you, so the medical fee should rightfully be given to me.”\r\n\r\nZhong Shujin was so weak she could only surrender to pay off her debts.\r\n\r\nGu Qingyin: “There’s still a long way to go, so I’ll explore from top to bottom.”>"
