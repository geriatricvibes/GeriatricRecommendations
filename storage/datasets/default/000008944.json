	"description": "The Rainy Mansion was a house that looked damp and gloomy even on a sunny day. It was a place where the boundary between the living and the dead was ambiguous.\r\n\r\nWhen a murder case happened at the Rainy Mansion, it seemed it could be easily solved because the heritance dispute among the residents was well known.\r\n\r\nThe detectives investigating the case were perplexed by the strange deduction made by Ayano Hayase, a beautiful woman who was freeloading at the mansion.\r\n\r\n“The open roof is a locked-room.”\r\n\r\n“There is a granny ghost inside the closet.”\r\n\r\nIt was said that the criminal cases at the Rainy Mansion would always end up being cold cases. And now, a serial murder had occurred there.\r\n\r\nA rookie detective, Tanimoto, was working hard to solve the case while being puzzled by words and action of the poker face beauty Ayano.>"
