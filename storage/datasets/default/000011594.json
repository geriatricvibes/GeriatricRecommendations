	"description": "Lucinda Lancaster was adopted by an earl from an orphanage, and on her tenth birthday, she regained her memories of her previous life. Lucinda loved fantasy RPGs, and now that she has been reincarnated in a world of swords and magic, she decides to become a magician and start her journey as an adventurer in the future. At the age of fifteen, she enrolled in a magic academy where she was told by a mysterious beautiful girl that this was the world of an otome game and that she was a villainous daughter.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to ignore the romance with my step brother, the prince, my homeroom teacher, and the prime minister’s son, and live a serious school life! I don’t know why everyone is so interested in me, but I’m just going to aim for the path to becoming a magician!”>"
