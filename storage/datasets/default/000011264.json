	"description": "Michiru Oikawa, a magazine editor, was told by her long-time male friend that he was getting married just when she thought she was going to be confessed to. She lied to him that she had a boyfriend, so he asked her to bring him to the wedding party. As a result, she had no choice but to hire a rental boyfriend. It turns out, the man who showed up on the day was her boss Kamijemori, someone she has been uncomfortable with.\r\n>"
