	"description": "Before their marriage, Mr. Mu was a cold, handsome, and wealthy big boss. A lot of young girls fell for him. But, he only had his eyes on his little assistant. He was cold and harsh toward her. \r\n\r\nThe little assistant was pitiful. “Big boss, please be gentle.” \r\n\r\nThe wicked big boss smiled wickedly, “Marry me and I’ll give you the kind of gentleness specially for you.” \r\n\r\n>"
