	"description": "I lived a pretty pathetic life. My fiancé not only used me, but also cheated on me. And my family, instead of protecting me, their daughter, acted as if I was at fault and announced that I wasn’t their real child. To top all of that off, I was almost killed for political reasons. So, I decided to end my pain. But somehow, I miraculously went back in time.\r\n\r\nWith my second chance, I decided to take my revenge. Take revenge on my enemies and refine myself, cleaning up my past mistakes one by one… And break up with my fiancé who’ll just end up bothering me in the future.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. I didn’t know you suffered this much...”\r\n\r\nHowever, the man who’d told me that he cheated on me because he thought that I was unattractive was now apologizing.\r\n\r\n“I’ve changed my mind. I’m interested in you.”\r\n\r\n“...”\r\n\r\n“I never thought that I would find my first love at this age. If you feel sorry for me, why don’t you pay me back.”\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Duke that I temporarily allied with to be able to break up with my ex-fiancé  started becoming obsessed with me. I was just trying to accomplish my revenge so why is everything so different from the past.>"
