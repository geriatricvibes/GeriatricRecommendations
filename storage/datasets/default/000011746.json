	"description": "The first to third arcs have Science Fantasy-ish tone; theories of magic, components of magic power, construction, and mystery of its nature over time. Theses, experiments, inquiries, validations, and deriving the formulas and numerical values. We are persistently delving into the elements of “turning magic into science”. Chapter 4 is some other thing, covering the standard Fantasy. Looking from the front end, it’s about a brave protagonist in a fantasy setting, but it has sarcasm tone in the back. As the title suggests, the protagonist died and became undead in the first few chapters, but that doesn’t mean this will become a grimdark story. Well, maybe.>"
