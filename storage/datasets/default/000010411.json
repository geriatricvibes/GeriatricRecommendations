	"description": "Yun Bixue is in dire straits—\n\nHer fiancé has abandoned her for the country’s top socialite. Worst of all, her family has been declared bankrupt, and the media has forced her into desperation. In her desolation, she seeks help from the powerful Young Master Xie, and gains strength through her marriage with him during her lowest period. From that day onwards, she eggs herself to grow stronger to become the best wife for her husband. \n\nThis novel is a sweet, sugary book. There are no heart-wrenching scenes or misunderstandings. \n\nSugary Scene\n\nYun Bixue: “Limo, aren’t you going to ask who I met today?”\n\nXie Limo: “It doesn’t matter who you met. What matters is that you’re here by my side now.”\n\nYun Bixue “Limo, let’s make a pinky promise. In the future, I will trust you, and you will trust me too. We will not allow external factors to affect our home, and we’ll be just like the saying ‘if you do not abandon me, I will always be at your side until the end of my life’.” \n\nXie Limo met Yun Bixue’s determined gaze and without thinking, he reached out his finger and sealed the promise before intertwining their fingers together.>"
