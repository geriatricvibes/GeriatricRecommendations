	"description": "She was a miracle-working doctor in the 21st century. One day, she transmigrated to the ancient times and became the imperial consort of Prince De. However, within a day, she divorced her husband and married the crippled Eldest Prince.\n\n…\n\nIt was said that Mu Xiyue not only had no practical ability, but also was shrewish. Nowadays, she married another man after the divorce, which courted countless gossips and rumors.\n\n…\n\nIn the imperial banquet, she proved her purity and virginity.\n\nBehind the fake mountain in the imperial garden, she looked at the furious man in front of her, “So? Did the face-slapping hurt, Prince De”\n\n…\n\nIn the deep night, she climbed over the high wall with much load on her shoulder, but fell into someone’s arms.\n\nThis someone grinned, “Darling, where are you going?”\n\nMu Xiyue shivered, akimbo, “I’m leaving you. You’re such a liar!!!”\n\nIt was heard that the Eldest Prince had his legs hurt and couldn’t do his responsibility of reproducing. Unexpectedly, after she cured him, he almost eat her up.\n\nWho told her that he couldn’t have sex? It turned out he was totally a magnificent beast on bed.>"
