	"description": "Embarrassing!  She wanted to curse.  He’s a stalker!\r\n\r\nNow, what is he up to?!\r\n\r\nRemembering the “wolf” on the train, Xiang Ti was so ashamed.  She just wanted to dig a hole and hide!\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this man was the most outstanding and attractive she’d ever encountered.\r\n\r\nBut her plan in life did not include marriage.  She wants to focus on a career and live life like the modern woman.\r\n\r\nHer whole image exuded the “don’t offend me” message, however —\r\n\r\nThis man did not heed the warning and pursued her persistently!\r\n\r\nAlthough there were not many suitors before her “stalker”, but she was still dissatisfied with this “wolf”.\r\n\r\nEven if he used his eyes to worship her, and generously praised her beauty, she is not happy!\r\n\r\nBecause she didn’t want to fall in love with any man.\r\n\r\nBut when he smiles, why can’t she stop thinking about him?!\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening, when she is never one to be seduced by the “male beauty” before?!\r\n\r\nBut he’s proven to be a sly fox.  How is she supposed to resist?!>"
