	"description": "Gu Mian transmigrated as the female partner of the popular novel 'I'm So Popular'. The original owner disliked the fact that the male lead came from a bad background and dumped him three times which resulted in a tragic end of their relationship. \r\nGu Mian was fearless even when she was controlled by the plot.\r\nShe only waited for the original plot to end so that she would retreat and hide her merit and fame.\r\nBut! \r\nGu Mian was stunned.\r\nWhy couldn't she even break up for the first time?\r\n　　-\r\nThe male lead said indifferently, 'I can’t be your boyfriend anymore.'\r\nGu Mian breathed a sigh of relief, did he finally agree to break up?\r\nThe male lead's thin lips twitched lightly, 'So Mian Mian, let's get married.'\r\n>"
