	"description": "Since around middle school, Tokido Haku has seen this nightmare every night……\r\nOn it, the unknown Rei and Sakuhi were both trying to kill each other.\r\n\r\nWho were this two people?\r\nWhy did they always come out in her dream?\r\nHaku had no idea at all.\r\n\r\nThis world was constituted by two parts, one pretty close to a modern world, the “Outside World” and one where magic existed, the “Inside World”.\r\n\r\nSince both civilizations developed in a different form, even if their existence were so close to each other, this caused a huge instability.\r\n\r\nThat instability was the cause of wars, crimes and many unstoppable acts made by humanity.\r\nWith that in mind, an evil organization used dark magic to plunge the world into chaos……\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning behind Haku’s dream?\r\nWhat was the role she and her friends were given?\r\nThe battle of the boys and girls who stood up to return the world peace begins now.>"
