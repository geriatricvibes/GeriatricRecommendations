	"description": "The thousand-year-old ghost Ren Li has always been the final boss in the last level of the escape game “Dream Control”. But one day, he suddenly became a player, breaking his way through with humans.\n\nIn the game dungeon, Ren Li educates various bosses, slaps players who have bad intentions, and blinds everyone with various simple actions.\n\nBut… there is always a person, no matter how cruel Ren Li is, he will remain unmoved, and even dare to hold him and act like a baby.\n\nThat person is Pei Jingling.\n\n*\n\nPei Jingling acting like a baby: “Brother Li, gimme hug.”\n\nRen Li immediately had black lines on his face: “You stand up straight for me, don’t rush on me! Don’t you have bones?”\n\nPei Jingling became more desperate: “I still want a kiss…”\n\n“Shameless…” Ren Li scolded him fiercely and embraced the person tightly in his arms, “Come, kiss me.”>"
