	"description": "“Young master, Liu gongzi has returned the engagement token to you, the Soul Locking Bead!”\n\n“Really? This is exactly what I want! He is really thoughtful!”\n\n“But he came to break off the engagement! However, Liu gongzi is willing to marry you as a concubine while me as the first wife cause I’m more gifted!”\n\n“Give me 20,000 gold coins and I’ll free you two, the bit*h couple.”\n\nWas something wrong with the script? Shouldn’t the man use coercive strategy to win his man back?\n\n“My fortune teller said I have a perfect match waiting for me. Who the hell do you think you are?”\n\nThis is a touching history of the regeneration of a loser to immortal. He has captivated his male god, retaliated the love rat and then risen to the pinnacle of success!\n\nSome passerby: Touching? Why don’t I think so?>"
