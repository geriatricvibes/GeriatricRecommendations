	"description": "As Earth-san leveled up, everyday life was dyed into fantasy.\r\n\r\nDungeons and monsters appeared, and the karma status system was released for many creatures.\r\n\r\nThe petite girl Hitsujiya Meiko, who celebrated it like the other creatures from all over the world, was swallowed by the appearance of a dungeon infested with monsters.\r\n\r\nSometimes she saves people around the world, sometimes guides them, sometimes makes them enthusiastic, sometimes makes them misunderstood. This is a story about a girl running through the new world with no intention of concealing her activity.>"
