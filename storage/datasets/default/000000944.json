	"description": "At the mouth of an alley, that blind fortuneteller said to me, “You are destined to have a rough road of love. Your entire life will be intertwined with a man, and it will be impossible for you to acquire a peaceful end.” \r\nI shoved my leftover soda into his hands, dusted my ass, and left. “Hey, you haven’t paid!” The blind was still bellowing behind me at a distance. \r\n\r\nAre you kidding me? You didn't even work out whether I’m a man or a woman and you dare want money? I’m doing a good deed by not wrecking your stand.\r\n\r\nI'm now sitting at the train station, disheveled and empty-handed, with my face swelled up like a pig’s. I recall the blind fortune teller’s words and regret that I had blown him off with my leftover soda at the time.  I should have given him some money. Unfortunately, I've been a fool until today. My life has been intertwined with a man all along, however I have yet to realize that nothing good will come of it in the end...>"
