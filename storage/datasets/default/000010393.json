	"description": "The engagement of the younger sister of Viscount Ragulen, Lucia, was suddenly dissolved by Count Gourman. The reason seemed to be her dowry.\n\nBut, when she thought about it, it was better to support her brother, Alves, and work hard to rebuild her territory than to marry the arrogant count. \nRather, the annulment was the best thing that could have happened to her!\n\nIt was a start to days full of happiness.\n\nHowever, Lucia received an invitation for Gorman’s wedding from the countess. She knew it was to insult her. \nNevertheless, due to her family stature, she was obliged to attend. But alas! Her brother was too busy to go with her. \n\nWhen her brother and sister were at a loss, her brother’s friend, Phil, offered to accompany her.>"
