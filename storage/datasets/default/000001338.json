	"description": "After going to the great beyond, Hirano Bonta was reincarnated as an Evil God. Descending upon the Demon Lands, he came across his follower, the 108th Demon Lord, the <Dethroned Crown Prince> Drake.\r\n\r\nA fortuitous omen...thought Drake, who had suffered a great defeat in battle, leaving him with only 200 underlings. On top of that, pursuers were hot on his tail; he was between a rock and a hard place. But the genius strategist Drake was not ready to give up just yet. Despite the crisis, he still held the ambition of unifying his nation once again.\r\n\r\nThe history-geek Hirano was super excited and was determined to support Drake as an Evil God, but as a newbie Evil God there was little he could do...just how will they get through this together?!>"
