	"description": "After an otaku died and was transmigrated into the world of cultivation, he fervently struggled until he managed to join a cultivation sect. In the middle of a day’s cultivation, he unexpectedly activated a cheat — the Digitise System.\r\n\r\nYou find it hard to gain insights into cultivation? It is just like playing a game to me.\r\n\r\nStuck at a bottleneck? I can easily breakthrough by pummeling a few random beasts and completing a couple of missions.\r\n\r\nSkills are too difficult to grasp? I mastered so many skills that I can’t decide which ones to use.>"
