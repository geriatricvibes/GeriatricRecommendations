	"description": "In late 1997, the Asian economy, including Korea, collapsed.\n\nIt was the foreign exchange crisis.\n\nPeople in their home country will be the hardest, but the same is true for people in foreign countries.\n\nThe toughest people in foreign countries are probably international students who pay tuition in their home country.\n\nAlthough the economy has been difficult, the won, dollar or one pound exchange rate has surged in most Asian countries.\n\nAs of June 1998, it is better than when it went up, but still much higher than before.\n\nIf we can easily say that the won-dollar exchange rate is going up, it means that the value of the won will be lowered.\n\nFather told a part of the novel he liked this time.\n\nThere are two opportunities to earn big pennies.\n\nOne is when the country is built,\n\nOne is when the country is ruined,\n\nThe bigger the money, the more time the country is ruined.\n\nIt’s what Let Butler said at the ‘disappear with the wind.’\n\nRett Butler says he earned $ 500,000 at the time of the collapse of the South.>"
