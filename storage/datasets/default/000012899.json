	"description": "In college, Zhou Jingze and Xu Sui were very different from each other— their paths would never cross.\r\n\r\nOne was a free spirit, a moon surrounded by a myriad of stars. The other was a well-behaved and quiet girl, easy to be ignored.\r\n\r\nAs she finished her assignments one after another in the library, she had no intention to listen to matters regarding him and others. Yet, she had witnessed him changing girlfriends one after another.\r\n\r\nAt a party, Xu Sui was drunk and summoned up the courage to confess to him.\r\n\r\nZhou Jingze froze for a moment, then raised the corners of his lips and said casually: “I’m sorry, you are too well-behaved and quiet.”\r\n\r\nThey met again, countless times, whether it was intentionally or unintentionally. Xu Sui should have pushed down her thoughts and kept a distance from him.\r\n\r\nYet, he kept pressing, leaving her nowhere to hide. Finally, Xu Sui was against a wall: “Why me?” Zhou Jingze lowered his head and whispered to her: “There is no why; I used to be blind.”>"
