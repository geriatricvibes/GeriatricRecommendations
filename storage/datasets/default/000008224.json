	"description": "Dynasties rise and dynasties fall, like the tide washing the sand.\r\n\r\nOn one side, he suffers from intrigue and hides his great ambition; on the other, the mysterious girl hides her anger behind her gentle smile.\r\n\r\nWho toppled the country, establishing their dynasty?\r\n\r\nWho built the Yellow Springs and set it over Imperial Power, inciting strife and conquering the earth?\r\n\r\nWho exchanged gazes at the Nine Palaces to the sound of halberd and blood, watching the falling flowers of Acacia?\r\n\r\nWho drank the poisoned wine and smiled, trading it for a cinnabar dot to the chest?\r\n\r\nTribulation and strife has destroyed past prosperity; he would not retreat, and she has not finished singing.\r\n\r\n.... Is she disturbing the earth world, or is the world disturbing her?\r\n\r\nThis is a seemingly simple story about an era of recovering the old country and the fight for the throne, and the men and women on both sides.\r\n\r\nTo conquer or resist;\r\nTo push away or fight for chance.\r\nTo provoke or to still;\r\nTo love, or to refuse love.>"
