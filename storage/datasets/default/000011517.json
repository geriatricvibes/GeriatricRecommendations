	"description": "I’m a very ordinary girl, with no interest in otome games, but was suddenly sucked into the world of the cliche Heartthrob Love Revolution.\r\n\r\nThat’s all well and good, I’m not exactly thrilled, but it’s fine. However, why am I the heroine’s older brother? I’m a girl! My character is named Makoto, and I hang out with the Heroine to help her get together with the princely character and make it to the end credits.\r\n\r\nAll righty, I just need to support the Heroine while she does her best. If I do, I think I’ll be able to go back to my world… but, why am I so popular? Hey, prince, don’t you blush at me!>"
