	"description": "In 2031 A.D. mysterious crystal bodies referred to as 『C.E.』 attacked. Humanity was gradually pushed down the road to ruin.\n\nThis is the story of a great hero who save the Earth from destruction with his shining holy sword――not.\n\nIn history during humanity’s grimmest hour, this is the story of the overshadowed hero, a lone spear user.\n\nIn often cases, this would be a story about a cheat protagonist and his harem; but, this story is from the point-of-view of a supporting character that shows the conspiracy behind such plots.\n\nBasically, the theme is school battles.>"
