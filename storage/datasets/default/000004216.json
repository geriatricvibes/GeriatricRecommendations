	"description": "Shen Jun has long been eyeing the man who lives across the street, and every night he fantasizes about having sex with him. He lives alone, seems to be a bit of a neat freak, is handsome, has a defined figure, and is especially tickled by those long legs below his strong waist every night.\r\n\r\nTo fantasize is to fantasize. But he never would have imagined that one day, the man would serve him his crotch.>"
