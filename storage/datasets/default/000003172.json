	"description": "[I have a childhood friend next to me. That’s all I need to know about this romantic comedy]. Fushimi Hina is the most universally recognized S-class beauty in the school. She is a childhood friend of Ryo, but they hardly spoke to each other from junior high school to senior high school, but one thing leads them to talk to each other again. After that, Hina takes care of Ryo and acts aggressively, but Ryo doesn’t really understand the meaning of her actions.>"
