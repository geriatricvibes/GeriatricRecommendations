	"description": "Xuan Yi traveled through the fantasy world and became the elder of the Profound Sword Sect, starting with the Nascent Soul Realm!\n\nAwakening the  Disciple System, the more enchanting the apprentice’s talent, the stronger Xuan Yi’s strength!\n\nThe Breakthrough of others depends on cultivation, and the Breakthrough of Xuan Yi depends on accepting disciples!\n\nAlthough he is an elder, have you ever seen an elder who is hundreds of times stronger than the Sect Master?\n\n“Little sister, I think your bones are amazed. You are a Sword Cultivator. Why don’t you worship me as a teacher! You can choose the holy order technique, and the nine-grade pill will be a snack for you.”\n\n“Ding, congratulations to the host, You have received a disciple with an aptitude of more than 9999. Reward:  Improve the host’s ten realms, three holy ranks!”>"
