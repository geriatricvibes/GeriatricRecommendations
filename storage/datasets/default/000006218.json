	"description": "Two parallel universes.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the apocalypse, the trajectory of history driven into two different paths, completely altered the two universes.\r\n\r\nOne is a heaven, and one is a hell.\r\n\r\nOne is an era of peace while the red flag fluttered.\r\n\r\nOne is the end of the world where zombies rampaged, and lives devastated.\r\n\r\nGu Ning tried to survive in the apocalyptic world, trying all her best to protect her family and loved ones. Yet, she dies brutally on the streets after being betrayed.\r\n\r\nShe woke up in a strange dimension.\r\n\r\nAn empty dimension, and a door.\r\n\r\nOpened the door once, it is the peaceful era. Opened the door again, it is the end of the world.>"
