	"description": "One day during summer vacation. When I came home from my part-time job, I found that my little sister’s friend had come to stay with us. She had run away from home and wanted to stay at our house for a while.\n\nMy parents were on a business trip, so it was just me, my little sister, and her friend. I was worried, but I thought it would be okay.\n\nThe next day, however, my little sister was off on an excursion for her club activities. It was a week-long expedition.\n\nSince my little sister had gone off, it was just me and her friend at home.\n\n…..No matter how you look at it, isn’t this bad?>"
