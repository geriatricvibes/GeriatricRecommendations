	"description": "I’m Lydel Cross.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned 18 the Emperor trapped me in a magical tower and used me in whatever way he saw fit. That was the life I lived before it was rewound.\r\nIn order to be happy during my second chance at life, I decided to turn away from anything related to magic, even becoming the maid of a count. At least, that’s how it was supposed to be…\r\n\r\n“You’re the only person I have! Please steal him from Milena! I beg of you!”\r\n\r\nWait a moment, master. The ‘boy’ you want me to pull from her lady wouldn’t happen to be the butler, whose face looks so much like the Emperor’s I can’t get used to it, now would it?\r\n\r\nJust looking at his face makes me anxious, and you’re telling me to seduce Graham?\r\n\r\n…Will I not be able to live this life quietly either?>"
