	"description": "Reborn to 1996, Bei Yao became a four-year-old little dumpling, living opposite the world’s catastrophic devil who had a crush on her twenty years later. Devil Pei Chuan was now five years old, with disabled legs and inferiority complex. \n\nLater they became seventeen, Bei Yao became a “school flower” of her high school. Pei Chuan froze, clasped his wheelchair tightly, and warned her, “Don’t say you like me, or else …” Bei Yao hugged his neck and smiled sweetly at him. Pei Chuan couldn’t help but hold her waist, and his suppressed emotions broke out. Belonging to his heart for two lives, Bei Yao wanted to know what the devil was like.>"
