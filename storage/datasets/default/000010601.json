	"description": "I was just playing R-19 games as usual.\n\nBut I suddenly woke up in the game world as Sasha, the protagonist of the reverse harem game, who has the mystical power to heal wounds or diseases.\n\nBut does she fix it with magic? Or make a potion or something? Of course not! She is a character who heals with her body!\n\nI have to break the quest to get out of the game.\n\nHow do I increase the likelihood of this guy’s strategy game?\n\n“It’s a sensitive body. I like it.”\n\n(She trembles in fear and sheds tears.)\n\n(I feel in pleasure.)◀\n\nNo! I haven’t felt it! I haven’t even picked it!\n\nWhat Kind of Treatment Is This?>"
