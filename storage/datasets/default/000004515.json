	"description": "Zhang Jiaohua, just another ordinary Post-80, with no speciality compared to his peers. Same food, diet and play, acting like a spoiled child towards his parents, towards his Grandpa and Grandma like a Tyrant, getting into fights and scuffles with village brats, stealing one mao from parents to go buy a popsicle, picking grapes to eat from the grapevine in Zhang Jiujin’s house, going to the mountains to fish out birds nest…….just the same, just the same, there was nothing unusual in any way.\r\n\r\nAt the age of six years he experienced an unusual event, that completely changed his life path.\r\n\r\nGreat Dao is Life, Life is Great Dao.>"
