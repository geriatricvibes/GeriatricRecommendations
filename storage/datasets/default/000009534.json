	"description": "As a BOSS, you just obediently stay in your own lair (dungeon), before being turned into a scapegoat. Most of the time you are beaten down over and over, watching your own items get snatched by others again and again. It’s really miserable.\r\n\r\nRegardless of his ultimate fate, a certain BOSS gritted his teeth and said, 'I just don’t want to die, what do I do?'\r\n\r\nXie Ziyi: Hmph, fighting with players is fun.\r\n\r\n[System Announcement] The Ultimate Dungeon of Jiuzhou, [Juechen Palace], has been opened. Become the first player to beat the Ultimate Dungeon and you will receive both 10,000 taels of gold and the title: 'Number One in the World.”>"
