	"description": "I’m stuck on a remote island with the male leads in an R-19 novel.\n\nI possessed Margaret, the villainess destined to be killed by the male leads after tormenting the female lead. So to survive, I have to run away from the male leads……\n\n“Marga…… ret?”\n\nThe 1st male lead’s hand grabbed my ankle as I was about to run away.\n\nFrom the very beginning, my plans were ruined.\n\n***\n\nA lot has changed after I went through the twists and turns on the remote island with the male leads who hated me.\n\n“Don’t get away from my side, it’s dangerous.”\n\n“Please let me help you. I’m going crazy for fear of what’s going to happen to you.”\n\n“Look at me, okay? Can you look at me, too?”\n\nThe crazy male leads who were supposed to be obsessed with the female lead started to obsess over me.\n\nI just want to survive safely!\n\nMoreover, this strange tropical island seems to have a deep secret that we have not yet realized.>"
