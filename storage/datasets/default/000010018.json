	"description": "The elders used to scold you if you blithely brought home something preowned by someone else, saying ‘You shouldn’t thoughtlessly bring in things from outside.’\r\n\r\nThey thought you might experience bizarre things if by chance that item had belonged to someone who had passed away. You might disregard this as superstition in this age where recycling is considered a virtue, but in truth, they were right.\r\n\r\nHow do I know this is true?\r\n\r\nBecause the item I have right now is one of those things.. And it’s not just to the degree of having a strange aura. It has something of a special ability.>"
