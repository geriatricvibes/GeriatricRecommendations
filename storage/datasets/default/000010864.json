It turns out that the gentle and sentimental lord god has been alone by himself, guarding the long and endless period of time that he had forgotten… this book is a quick transmigration novel, this is the story of a foodie go-getter and a dimpled lord god.\n\nA strawberry flavored scholar youth, a lemon flavored cold and aloof film emperor, a snow pear flavored black belly… however, the edible target became the person whom he shared the rest of his life with. Gou Liang’s life underwent sky toppling and earth turning changes.\n\nThe you in the next world as well, what flavor would you be?>"
