	"description": "Eight years ago, Thunderclap Ancient City changed overnight. Young City Lord Qin Ming was sold off to Azure Cloud Sect as a servant and 200,000 common people were driven into Great Azure Mountain as slaves.\n\nEight years later, after tempering his spirit and becoming a martial artist, the Asura awakens, an unyielding youth that defies heaven rises.\n\nProvide me a blade and I will be able to break the blue dome of heaven. Provide me a sword and I can show the heavens. A Golden Unicorn is an animal with no particular talent, but when encountered with an unstable situation, it will change into a dragon[1].\n\nActing Asura’s Child, Undying Monarch, Thunderclap Battle Senior, Ancient Ocean Barbarian Emperor and so on. Each and every title fell onto Qin Ming’s body. This lofty and unyielding youth stepped on heaven yet was fine. He guided numerous close friends and young beauties, proudly fought everywhere, swept across the world, and composed deeply moving hot-blooded battle songs.\n\n[1]: This is most likely a play on words, how a Golden Unicorn(Jinlin[金麟]) can turn into a Qilin(麒麟) when encountering tumultuous times.>"
