	"description": "The youngest princess of the country of Stellaus, Marietta, was betrothed in a political marriage to the General of the great militant country, Oltaire. General Belvant was often said to be strong, a fierce and terrifying god of a warrior. On the other hand, Marietta was a delicate flower of a princess. Everyone felt pity for poor Marietta’s situation, however, the truth was that Marietta found the General very dreamy… The story of a 30-year old General with a scary face (who was actually quite nice), and the tiny and adorable 18-year old Princess in their times of conflict and of lovey-doveyness.>"
