To pretend to be Lilietta, the youngest daughter of the Duke of Bauner, who lost his daughter and went crazy!\n\n“I’m Lilietta, the daughter my father has been searching for for 10 years.”\n\n“It’s you, my beloved daughter.”\n\nSo I became the daughter of the Mad Duke. Now all I have to do is run away before I get caught…\n\nHowever, the family of the villains is so obsessed that I can’t see the way out.>"
