	"description": "I am K.\n\nBorn in a country called South Korea, I was a young man from the noble lineage of the “Park” family. One day, I found myself under the curse of a witch in an unfamiliar world, a victim of misfortune.\n\nBut pay no heed to my circumstances. Now, I am not a son of the noble “Park” family, nor the “Blackie” of the old witch; I am merely lone-spirited cat K. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\n…even if I may be called the Crown Prince’s “Butterfly.” At least until I find a way to lift this curse, I might as well live comfortably at my Sugar Prince’s expense.\n\n「And with a kiss, I transform into a man by night…」>"
