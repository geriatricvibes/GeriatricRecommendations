	"description": "I, Ishigaki Kurousagi, was the Demon King in another world. My childhood friend, Minuzaki Rei, who was a hero in another world, has already confessed to me and had a relationship with me. However, I don’t remember any of this at all. So… I decided to have him confess again to me in this world.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this one-sided romantic comedy and contemporary fantasy with the cool, tsundere hero[Kurousagi], who teases his childhood friend while confessing his love in his heart.>"
