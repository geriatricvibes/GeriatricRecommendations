	"description": "In order to help his father investigate the true situation at the group’s clothing company, Qi Yu was almost involved in an economic case. Fortunately, he was able to get away because of “an old hand” who had selflessly been providing him with help.\n\nBut as his interactions with this old hand grew, Qi Yu gradually began to discover that all this was far less simple than it seemed. He began to have his doubts about the other’s true identity and his purpose for appearing at his side…\n\n“There is only one true heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it.”\n\n——Romain Rowland>"
