	"description": "In the instant that his soul awakened, a new world emerged in front of his eyes. It was a foreign world, a world of Fuzhou. Countless secret realms, countless charming beasts. There were even higher-levelled Fuzhou worlds.\n\n12th Guo was like a pawn crossing the river*. He instantly killed all enemies that obstructed his survival. He needed to constantly get stronger, needed to find even stronger Fuzhous.\n\nWhen he stood on the peak of the Fuzhou world, could he still continue forward?\n\n* this line is likely a reference to the game of Xiangqi/象棋, where a pawn/soldier, upon crossing the halfway line of the board, known as the river, gains additional abilities.>"
