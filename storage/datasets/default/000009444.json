	"description": "Traversing is a good thing, but crossing into a world that is too dangerous is an undoubtedly bad thing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Su Ming decided to be a dragon, not to train himself as the sword god of Shilipo, and vowed not to give up.\r\n\r\nHowever……\r\n\r\n“I was a neighbor who lived near your house when I was young, and I played with you since I was young. Have you forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“You are my benefactor. If it weren’t for the piece of bread you gave me at the beginning, I wouldn’t have today. Therefore, I will use my whole life to repay you.”\r\n\r\n“Everyone treats me as a monster. Only you always treat me as a human being. In this life, I will only recognize you.”\r\n\r\nWhen the spotlight appeared in front of his eyes one after another, Su Ming’s whole body was not good.\r\n\r\nThis person is not tricky at all! ! !>"
