	"description": "The story begins with Shen Miao having been married twice with two ex-husbands. If you think that the story will be old-fashion revolving around the rivalry and jealousy of the two ex-husbands, then you are wrong. The story is really sweet and funny, with many twists and turns in the plot . It turned out that the two ex-husbands are actually staging a play together with a motive.  Thus, Shen Miao who is clueless about it from beginning to end is in fact performing a monologue as no one gave her a script beforehand.\r\n\r\nTrue feelings?\r\n\r\nFake feelings?\r\n\r\nWho took advantage of her?\r\n\r\nWho often protect her?\r\n\r\nWho is willing to wait five years for her?\r\n\r\nWho is willing to give up the throne for her? >"
