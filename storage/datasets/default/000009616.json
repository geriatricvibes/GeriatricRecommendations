	"description": "After being awakened, Su Yemu transmigrated from being a chef of the imperial kitchen to a fool. He refused to follow his heart, until then he had no choice but to live stream himself cooking in order to make a living.\r\n\r\nGenerals full of energy said: drinking a bowl of soup is a hundred times better than sleeping in a healing capsule.\r\n\r\nA group of historians, archaeologists, and biologists expressed: I’ll take this man.\r\n\r\nThe Federation and the Empire competed to say: This man is a citizen of my Empire (Federal).\r\n\r\nMarshal He glanced around : Who dares to touch my man.\r\n\r\nI woke up and became the existence that everyone wanted.>"
