	"description": "Arranged marriage, betrayed family, stifled dreams ......\r\n\r\nIn his last life, Li Xin had been trapped in suffocation and anger, until the moment before he died, when he saw the goodness that man had hidden for him underneath his indifferent attitude.\r\n\r\nHe will never trap himself in place nor be foolishly used again.\r\n\r\nThat man's goodness, he would not fail it again!\r\n\r\n'Major General, madam has brought you dinner!'\r\n\r\n'Major General, Madam has invited you to try out the new products!'\r\n\r\n'Major General, Madam has contracted out the base's cafeteria ......'\r\n\r\n'Madam, isn't this ...... too much?' The assistant's expression was aggrieved, the tone even more so, eyes blinking so hard he wanted to cry.\r\n\r\n'How is it too much? Isn't it only natural for me to be nice to my own partner?'>"
