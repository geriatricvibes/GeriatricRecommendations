	"description": "After her mother passed away, Elrose lost her fortune to her father and lived alone in a monastery's cabin.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing of her father's death, she escaped from the monastery and headed to the capital to inherit her inheritance and title. However, she had to get married within a few hours if she wanted the inheritance.\r\n\r\n'God, can you send me a man to be my husband? If you can, please do it right now.'\r\n\r\nDid God listen to her prayers?\r\n\r\nJust in time, a man fell down in front of Elrose! Her late mother said: 'Be careful when you choose your husband.' But she couldn't.\r\nElrose proposed to a man named Lakshan, who took her money.\r\n\r\n'Don't you want to pay me back with your body, not with your money?'\r\n\r\nShe never thought that Lakshan was the emperor's brother and the mercenary king.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLakshan laid on his bed and looked at Elrose, who fell asleep.\r\n\r\n'How did this happen?’\r\n\r\nHe just meant to help someone who said, for a moment, that they had nowhere to go.\r\n\r\nWhile he was at it, he would get some help. If he left someday, he was going to send it to her to say thank you.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lakshan now realized that he could never let her go.>"
