	"description": "He is like a long street in a dream that goes on forever.\n\nWhen Xiang Yu met Jin Fubai for the first time he took off his expensive shirt, casually crumpled it up, and handed it to her sitting on the ground. \n\n“Sit on this, it’s cold on the floor.”\n\nSeeing him for the second time, it was in a strange city suffering from a heavy rainstorm. Planes were canceled, trains were delayed and the hotel receptionist said politely to Xiang Yu, “Sorry, but we are fully booked.”\n\nYu Fubai leaned aside and asked her lightly, “I’m staying in the penthouse suite, do you want to come?”>"
