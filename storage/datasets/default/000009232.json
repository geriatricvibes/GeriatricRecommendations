	"description": "Wizard.\n\nIt is a transcendent who uses magic to fight, protect, and save. However, in the world of wizards, talent speaks for itself. The long history of magic has picked up only talented clans, and now the only wizards are aristocrats. That is common sense here in Manalil.\n\nAt the Beralt Magic Academy, one of Manalil’s leading educational institutions, the eggs of excellent wizards are gathering again this year.\n\nYes, except for one person. \n\nA simple boy who gets a lot of looks. A country bumpkin who has nothing to do with the glittering world. There was the only commoner at the academy.\n\n“I want to be a mage.” \n\nThe story of a peasant who wants to be a mage and fulfil his dream is about to begin.>"
