	"description": "In a world where humanity lives in suspended space, children undergo a fishing test when they come of age. Those with immaculate talents have the possibility of becoming great fishing masters.\r\n\r\nIn the endless sea, every life is imbued with a sacred mission. There are fish that can fly, turtles that have absorbed the worldly essence, and whales that can devour the heaven and earth… There are also countless fishers.\r\n\r\nFishing is an art.\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient saying: If you can’t fish, you might as well be bait.>"
