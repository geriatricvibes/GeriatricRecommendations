	"description": "She was kidnapped— kidnapped and put into a private men’s prison.\n\n“In this prison, if you are not obedient… be prepared to face the consequences.”\n\n“Damn it, what are you crying for? Open your eyes!”\n\nBai Zhi cowered into the corner.\n\nShe was like a little lamb dropped into a den of wolves. One wrong move and she’ll be eaten alive.\n\n—In short, this is the story of a pure and sweet FL domesticating a pack of prison wolves. The meat is fragrant and the plot is a little mind-boggling, but this pseudo-thriller is a truly wholesome story.>"
