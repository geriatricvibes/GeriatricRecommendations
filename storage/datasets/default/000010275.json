That life was just around the corner.\r\n\r\nA rosy future seemed to be in sight.\r\nThe problem was the moment he opened the envelope.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in Korea and the first in the world, an FFF-class person has appeared.\r\n\r\n-What kind of abilities has he awakened to?\r\n-Well, he has the ability to be a building owner.\r\n-Building owner? Is that the building owner I know? That’s his ability?\r\n-Pfft! Yes! The details are unknown, but wouldn’t it hurt the person more if we analyzed their abilities?\r\n\r\nThe broadcast was aired all over the world simultaneously. Joo Min-Seong quickly became the laughingstock of the world.\r\n\r\nOn that day, small flames of revenge bloomed in Joo Min-Seong’s heart.\r\n\r\n‘Even if it’s crawling, I will get my revenge.’\r\n\r\n===\r\n[FFF-class building owner capability is now linked.]\r\n[The connection is complete.]\r\n===>"
