	"description": "Two thousand years ago, the strongest sage destroyed the Demon King at the cost of his own life and 90% of the world. While in the verge of death, the weakest and most inferior student of the academy, the reincarnated Kite, regains all of his memories. Then, he awakened the power of the “Healing Hero”. Combine the sage’s strongest offensive magic, and the hero’s strongest healing magic, and you get the strongest person… Which is not a mistake, but during the two thousand years that have passed, swordsmanship and magic has declined beyond any imagination.>"
