In this world, everything he thought to be true disappears in a puff of smoke.\r\n\r\nIn the process, he begins to discover certain things about Rei’s past.\r\n\r\nWhat should he say? How should he act? Jun is faced with more and more difficult decisions.\r\n\r\nBecause life is determined by probabilities―>"
