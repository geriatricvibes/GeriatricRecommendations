	"description": "‘Less than a month old… I became the great empire’s treasured princess…!’\n\nIn all my life, I wanted love. Love from my family, But the family I had, failed me in the end. Abandoned… abused… I don’t want this so-called family. It’s a waste of time.\n\nI came to a new world after a miserable ending…\n\n‘The empire’s treasured princess… that’s me… but why is father, the emperor, so strange?’\n\n“Mabel, I will give you the Ponce Castle.”\n\n“My sweet child, the most fertile land is yours.”\n\n“No, wait, this whole country will be yours for the plucking.”\n\n‘Father, he’s strange… is this what family love is like?’>"
