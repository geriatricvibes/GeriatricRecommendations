	"description": "“Won’t you become a Goblin’s bride?” \r\n\r\nIn Yang-an, the capital of the Sun Dynasty Empire, there are rumors of a Goddess who sings a song that grants your wishes in your dreams if you visit a certain pharmacy. To confirm this, Sa Heonyoung, who disguises his status as a member of the royal family, goes to find the Goddess of the rumors. After listening to her song, he yearns for her, as if he is suffering from an illness…. \r\n\r\nA man who must kill his own identity under a goblin’s mask; and a woman who has no name or a lover, and lives only for the revenge in her mother’s will. A mournful love story between a man and a woman who are the only ones who can fully understand each other.>"
