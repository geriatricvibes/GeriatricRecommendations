	"description": "Xie Mu’s task was to make the scum gongs fall in love with him.\n\nHe skillfully disguised himself as a white lotus, delicate and pitiful, kind and naïve.\n\nEven if he became an existence thrown away by the slag gong like a cheap pair of shoes, it did not matter, because Xie Mu would quickly make him kneel and apologize, even willing to dig out his heart and present it on a silver platter.\n\nAnd once the slag gongs fell in love, he would, step by step, lead them into hell. \n\n[I didn’t abandon you, it’s you who abandoned the amnesiac me]\n[I didn’t cuck you on purpose, I was being forced ah]\n[Even though I used you as a substitute, it wasn’t on purpose]\n\nWhat could be crueler than abandoning someone only to want them back and find out that they’ve become forever out of reach?>"
