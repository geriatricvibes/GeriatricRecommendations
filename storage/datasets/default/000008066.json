	"description": "The brave are declining in their power and existence every day. For this reason, the world has decided to train a party of candidates to determine the true heroes. One of those candidates was the granting magician, Albade, who was added to the party as a breeder. However, as he grew stronger, the brave party was cloaked in greed and banished Albeado, who had supported them until now. But Albade himself has no regrets. He’s not despairing. Because he was………the Demon King. After all, Albade is disgusted with the modern-day candidate for bravery, and while thinking about the future, he has a fateful encounter with three sisters.>"
