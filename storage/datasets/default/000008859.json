	"description": "That day, my head was struck by an unknown object, and after I woke up, I realized that I’m able to, through titles, understand a person’s truest side.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I’m being pestered by a group of girls, them even not being humans at all, with various bizarre fetishes………….I’m having a harem, you say? If I’m still able to be alive at the end………….Mm, just take it as I have a harem then (gives off an understanding smile).>"
