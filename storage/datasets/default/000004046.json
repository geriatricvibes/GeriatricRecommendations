	"description": "Laviore Bailey—the ‘fake saintess’ who banished the innocent princess and stirred up bad blood to wage war.\n\nShe’s the villainess with a façade of a saintess.\n\n“I love you. So just shut your mouth and die. Okay?”\n\nBut the moment her trusted lover chose her as a sacrifice to the demon, and she realized her father was behind the plan, she killed herself by swallowing poison.\n\nIt hurt. It was so painful that she could not even scream. But it was fine. Because she knew this was not the end.\n\n“I will save you this time.”\n\nThen, she came back for her second life. She was determined to rescue those who were unlucky because of her and restored her life back.\n\n“You do whatever you want for the man in your dream.”\n\nDemian said with a rough smile.\n\n“I’ll also protect you the way I want to.”>"
