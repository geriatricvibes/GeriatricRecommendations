	"description": "If the big breasted demon queen was reduced to a slave, what would you do to her? Would you kill her and become humanity’s greatest hero? Or would you enslave her and enjoy the highest level of pleasure in the world? No, he doesn’t want any of that, Lin Xiao just wanted to be an unremarkable reserve hero. Black stocking long leg princess, two-faced loli saint… no one can tempt him to change his majestic ideals of eating and waiting for death! That’s why his answer was — “Demon Queen, can you quickly put on your clothes and scram on out of here?”>"
