	"description": "The story of a mild noble who slipped from one fantasy world into another. While he had no particular blessings in this other world, there was also no particular crisis. Until he returns, he will spend his warm days as an adventurer while being questioned and seen as a full-fledged nobleman. Brotherhood. Deep friendships. Because there is no feelings of love, this is not BL. While it may seem like it to that extent, I have to warn those who dislike such to refrain from reading.>"
