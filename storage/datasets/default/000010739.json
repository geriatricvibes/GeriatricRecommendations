	"description": "I’m Nanami Irie, and I’ve reincarnated as the heroine in an otome game.  I’m going to make all five of the male capture targets fall for me and get a reverse harem!  …. aaand that’s a big, fat lie.  I was able to make friends with the son of the Knights’ Commander (who has a sister complex) and the Duke’s heir (tsundere), but the Crown Prince (yandere) likes to swing me around and use me as he pleases… so I’d like to quit this heroine gig ASAP, please.\n\nPrequel to “It seems I'm the So-Called Villainess, but I'll Take my Punishment Properly so Please Let Me Off Easy”>"
