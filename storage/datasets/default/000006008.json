	"description": "When I opened my eyes, I became the nanny from a book I once read.\n\nThe nanny that kills the child she’s tasked to care.\n\nWith her experience from her previous life, she saves the child and saves her own life in the process as well… but strangely the child’s uncle keeps appearing before her.\n\n“Uncle, uncle.”\n\nBrielle has started to speak to his uncle.\n\n“S…sure.”\n\nAlthough the uncle’s response is awkward, his face glowed with a smile.\n\nHowever, his face hardened when his nephew said this,\n\n“Step away. Step away.”\n\nThat is what Brielle said when he saw the uncle and Marie (the nanny) together, who were deciding which storybook to read that day.>"
