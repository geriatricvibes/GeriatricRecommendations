	"description": "Approximately 5,000 years after humanity headed out into the far reaches of space, in the Perseus Arm that was thousands of light-years away from the Solar System and Earth, laid the Albion Kingdom. The young man who would be later called “Cliff Edge”, Clifford Cuthbert Collingwood, had just joined the Albion Kingdom’s navy as an officer cadet after graduating from its military academy.
