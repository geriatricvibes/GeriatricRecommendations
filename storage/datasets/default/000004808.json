	"description": "We’ve been married for three years, and I didn’t like her at first. She is so cute, only cold and hard to approach on the surface. In fact, she is delicate and sincere in her heart, even with a little bit of a cunning personality. She will step on anything to make me happy, so in my eyes, I must get her no matter how.\n\nLet her belong to me, completely.>"
