	"description": "Through the blood, Su Jinyue saw a familiar figure running towards her. With a sad smile, she only then realized that she had fallen in love with this man. If she could do it again, she will definitely choose to marry him. It’s a pity that there is no ‘if’ in life, and there is no restart…\r\n\r\nThe blessings of fate brought her back to the beginning. Since God has given her another chance, she will never make the mistakes of her previous life again. In this life, she only wants him. As for the people who hurt her, she will never show mercy.>"
