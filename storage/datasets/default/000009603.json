	"description": "“Who does she think she is? I won’t marry her even if she is the last woman on earth,” said Hiram Rong.\r\n\r\n“Marry into a family with tens of billions of assets? How lucky I am! I won’t be so foolish as to break off the engagement. At worst, I can receive money as part of the divorce settlement,” said Rachel Ruan.\r\n\r\nTheir great-grandfathers made a pact about their engagement a hundred years ago. They had been bound even before they were born.>"
