	"description": "Even if you die, even if you are reborn…\nYou will never be able to leave me.\n\nUnable to accept the emperor, who is engulfed in obsession and madness, I killed myself.\nBut a hundred years passed by…\nand I was reborn, as if it was fate, as if fate played tricks on me.\nAnd with my past memory intact at that!!\nI vowed never to see him again, but I hoped that at least he would’ve forgotten all his memory…\nCould I not have escaped him even with death…\nI face the reincarnation of the emperor once again.>"
