	"description": "An Xia, who was the head of five large families and a war goddess, was transmigrated into a pushover.\n\nHer mother was driven to madness, her family assets seized, her fiance urging to cancel their engagement, and she was given to another family as a gift? An Xia sneered: From this day on, I’ll ingrain this into all your hearts, what it means to beg for mercy! \n\nIn the end, the ‘relative’ who drove her out of her family, begged her miserably to return.\n\nNo mercy to those who humiliate her, deceive her. Even her ex-fiance will not be spared…\n\n“You will be protected. No matter success or failure, you will stand firm.” \n\n“You will be feared. No matter dead or alive, you will remain loyal.”\n\nThis is a story where two strong individuals join hands, where happiness and misfortune are shared among the two, and life or death are interdependent. Even so, they find warmth and eventfulness with each other’s presence.>"
