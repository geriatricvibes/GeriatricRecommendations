	"description": "I, Souichiro, picked up this little girl on a certain rainy day. Even though she has pink hair and wears unfamiliar clothing that looks like a cosplay, she still looks like a normal girl. If there is one thing not normal about her, then that would be—the single black wing that is growing out from her back. She who claims to be a Devil says that she has no place to return to, so I couldn’t help but decide to have her stay in my house.\n\nBut the situation doesn’t end there. Then on the next day, a blonde beautiful girl claiming to be an Angel visits my house. And according to this girl, I have a hidden possibility to become either a “Saviour” or a “Super Villain”—!? The ecchi love-comedy of a Delinquent boy×Devil girl×Angel girl brought to you by the super popular creator duo!>"
