	"description": "“Is this just the beginning?”\n\nShe opened her eyes and blinked rapidly.\n\n“You have to wash this.”\n\nElin sat down between his legs and held his genitals large enough to go mad.\n\nFlickering, the dark-red pillars swelled more and wriggling on the palm of my hand. The blood vessels became more prominent.\n\nThis is what Elin really wanted to taste. A decadent pillar of fire that stimulates all kinds of imagination, I must bite into it and suck it up.\n\nMy heart raced with anticipation and longing.\n\nUnlike the fairy-like face, the count’s cynical Elin, a tutor who is now teaching her daughter, Amber.\n\nAlthough she lacks skills, she has a warm heart and falls in love at first sight with Count Kerner, who has a heavenly beauty. \n\nThen one night, passing the Count’s room, he heard a moan and went inside… … \n\n“Sir, I want to help you.” \n\nCount Kerner was injured both physically and mentally due to an incident in the past.\n\nHe falls in love with Elin’s cute appearance and lovely appearance, who has joined her daughter’s tutor.\n\nShe enters Kerner’s cold heart as well as his secret room… ! \n\n“If it’s not to my liking, I’ll have to pay the price.” \n\nA love battle between a love-deficient woman and a loving tutor!>"
