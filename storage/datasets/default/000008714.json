	"description": "A poor baron daughter lived under her sister’s shadow, where none was for her.\r\n\r\nHer hair is full or hairballs, she doesn’t have a single dress, and all she has are tattered clothes for work.\r\n\r\nHer sister got the attention of a high rich noble but died on the way to her marriage.\r\n\r\nMarie was sent as a substitute bride for her sister, because the baron couldn’t repaid the already sold dowry to the Earl. But… that’s impossible?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the proposal was a misunderstanding?\r\n\r\nA beautiful and happy story of love about a fallen baron’s daughter and an eloquent Earl.>"
