	"description": "This is like a novel, right?\n\nI think I’ve possessed Muriel, the worst evil woman who destroys the world.\n\nOr maybe I’m going crazy or I’m having a weird dream.\n\nAnyway, if I don’t do something, The World will end!\n\nI saved the men who were going to die from my evil deeds,\n\nI tried to live a good life without touching evil power.\n\nBut The devil waiting for my depravity continues to fret and seduce me.\n\n“You look better as a wicked woman.”\n\n“If you want to live, you have to pray to the devil.”\n\n“What is that disaster-level magic skill? Why don’t you borrow the power of the devil?”\n\nI wanted to help him even though I knew there was nothing good about being involved with him.\n\n Kaiton Ur.\n\nHe’s not actually the devil, he’s just a black wizard struggling to live, and I’m the only one in the world who knows that.\n\n“I don’t beg for my life from the devil.”\n\n”I’m going to save the devil.”\n\nI decided to restore the demon king’s honor, but it’s a little strange that he doesn’t want it.\n\n“I don’t need everyone’s love. Don’t you know what I really want?”\n\nThe more you dream of world peace, the more you become the leader of the villain’s den.\n\nThe struggle for love and peace by the unlucky villain, Muriel Storm.>"
