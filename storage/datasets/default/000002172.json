	"description": "Curtis. My first love that killed my father.\r\n\r\n“Make a wish, Roxana.”\r\n\r\nNow, a man who only sees my neck as a plaything for the tip of a blood-soaked sword… Is this really him?\r\n\r\n“Do you know? With that pretty face, even if you tremble, you will be able to escape death?”\r\n\r\nHis softly smiling lips spouted sarcasm towards her.\r\nA terrifying madness flashed in front of her eyes.\r\nIn his small, warm hand, a blue-edged sword was held as if it were one body.\r\n\r\nRoxana stared up at him blankly, covered in blood and dirt.\r\n\r\nCurtis.\r\nMy father’s sins eventually came to kill me. >"
