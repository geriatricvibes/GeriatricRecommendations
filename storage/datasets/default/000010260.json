	"description": "I became the secretary of a tyrant in place of my clumsy brother to survive. \n\nBut I have so much potential for it. I’m so darn good at my job. Because I served the tyrant so well, ‘everyone has a happy ending’. \n\nWell then, shall I quit being a secretary and live a leisurely life now? \n\n“Rosaline, tell me what you want?” he asked as he stepped down from his chair.\n\n “I want to quit.” \n\nHis eyebrows twitched slightly. \n\n“Do you want to die?” \n\nYour Highness, you never hold on to people who want to leave, so why’re you being like this to me?>"
