	"description": "Shopkeeper’s copywriter: I don’t know where I came from, but I take all kinds of cases, especially supernatural cases.\n\nCan you hear the mermaid singing?\n\nCan you see the miniature dwarf?\n\nHave you ever eaten a witch’s apple?\n\nThey all live around us, doing things we don’t know. They live off of their obssession, and eventually they give in to it.\n\nI thought my life is like that too, but then I realized I’m not like them, because I love him.>"
