	"description": "Tang Shumi and Ji Linchen had been engaged for two years without any sign of marriage. Tang Shumi became the laughing stock of socialites circles and the abandoned woman of a wealthy family. When everybody mocked Tang Shumi as to exactly when she would become Madam Ji– Ji Linchen tops Forbes’ list of Asia’s wealthiest individuals. \n\nThe interviewer questioned, “As the youngest billionaire on the list, have you ever encountered a problem you couldn’t solve with money?”\n\nThe usually cold and aristocratic man looked at the camera, eyebrows raised. With a subtle smile that did not reach his eyes, he briskly replied, \n\n“My fiancee refuses to marry me, does that count?”\n\nShumi sat in front of the TV, waving the postnuptial property agreement her assistant had just sent in her hands, a look of greed on her face, “Marry! Immediately, straight away!”>"
