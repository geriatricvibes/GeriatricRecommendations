	"description": "Wen Tian, on the way to send off his sister, was kidnapped by some people.\n\nThe multitude of bandits, happy and delighted: Boss, Boss, we have kidnapped a pleasant-looking wife for you.\n\nWen Tian: QAQ\n\nThe Bandit Leader: Come, my wife, let me look at you, baby.\n\nSifang Town has been bustling with liveliness recently. The town’s best-looking Young Master Wen has been missing for half the month and suddenly returns with a man.\n\nThe wild man, called Chu XiangTian, is the head of the bandits in the West Mountain. Rumors said that he was a devil who killed people without blinking.\n\nEveryone sighs incessantly. Young Master Wen is truly pitiful…\n\nYoung Master Wen, whom the people said were pitiful, stares fiercely with wide and round eyes. “You sleep in the study room at night!!”\n\nThe tall and burly man immediately has a black face.\n\nWen Tian, with pouting lips, says, “You are being fierce….. QAQ”\n\nChu XiangTian softens and itches to hold that person in his arms.>"
