	"description": "An Wuyang, who had gone out to play, had his wine drugged. At the time, he chose a pleasing man to address the problem and slept with him. One month later, dizziness, nausea, and sleepiness occurred; and he became pregnant. Between the child and college, An Wuyang chose… to have the baby.\n\nA wealthy 30-year-old Huo Yunchuan was ordered by his family to marry by the end of the year. Okay, just find someone with a hand to piss them off. What, pregnancy check!?\n\nHuo Yunchuan landed on both knees: QAQ mother asked me why I was kneeling and putting on shoes for my wife…\n\nAn Wuyang: I thought I was just giving birth to a baby so that I didn’t have to attend school, but now I am doing my homework.\n\nHuo Yunchuan: Oh. (People who helped with homework all year round dared not speak)>"
