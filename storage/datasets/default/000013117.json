	"description": "“Stay with me this time.”\n\nOn graduation day, I was reflecting on my dull high school years. My grades were bad, I’d given up on my dream, and my girlfriend and I had parted ways. She was now a national musician. I’d found myself in a completely different reality.\n\nBut that day.\n\nNito Chika, my ex-girlfriend, has disappeared.\n\nDumbfounded... I found myself time-traveling into the past on the day of the entrance ceremony.\nCan I save Nito in this world?\n\n…No, that’s not good enough.\nI'm hoping that this time we can be on equal footing—able to stand alongside her.\n\nI’ll try my hardest to rewrite those three years!\n\nA youth redo love story starting from graduation (the end).>"
