Materials have ranks, humans also have ranks. Since I’m named Han Bai, I’m deserving of jade.”\n\nJi Shen Yu: “Shi-ge has always been exceptional.”\n\nDing Han Bai: “Since I’m exceptional, then am I deserving of being your husband?” (Gong is quite shameless, always forcing others to be nice to him)\n\nBrash and troublesome young master; top quality gems specialist Gong X high EQ IQ beautiful; antique artefact manufacturing expert Shou.>"
