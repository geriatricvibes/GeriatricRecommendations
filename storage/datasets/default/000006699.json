	"description": "Kitahara Shinichi passed through into a world flooded with ghosts. \r\nHell was empty, all gods had died, only the ghosts were revived and raging in the world.\r\n\r\nJust this month, 6 people died at school in a row. Bugs with human faces were laughing quietly. A little girl in red peeped at him secretly. \r\nFinally, he returned home. His parents were killers who had been wanted for years. His sister was a zombie feeding on human flesh. His childhood sweetheart was a ghost returned from hell.\r\n\r\nBut, he didn’t know any of it because he had lost his memories. \r\nWell, from now on, all he could do was struggling for survival.>"
