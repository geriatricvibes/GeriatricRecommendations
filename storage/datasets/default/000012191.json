	"description": "Gongping (in Chinese, the pronunciation means justice), a cop, grew up in an orphanage. When his “home” was totaled by a bully property developer, he could do nothing but call upon a goddess to curse him to death. However, the humorous and merciful deity sent a thunderbolt down, which hit Gongping himself, and turned him into a plant man. After ten years of sleeping, Gongping woke up. He discovered he had supernatural powers. When he went back to the police station he once served, he was met by many dark creatures in human shape. They had come to the city he lived in for different purposes. Gongping never thought that all of the dark beasts would worship him, as his power was from a powerful ancient god, Xingtian. Gongping began a new life with a dragon beauty, a snake spirit, and other beast team members.>"
