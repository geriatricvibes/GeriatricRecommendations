	"description": "In a stallion novel there is always a Senior Martial Brother like this:\n\nIn the early stages of the novel, his innate talent is high, his cultivation is good, his appearance is handsome, and he has an intelligent, cute younger Martial Sister as a fiancée.\n\nIn the middle stages of the novel, he is caught unprepared and defeated by a young disciple (the protagonist) in the sect who’s hardly remarkable at all. From then on, he falls from his godly altar and loses his brilliance. Even his young Martial Sister leaves him for someone else.\n\nIn the late stages of the novel, he continues to blackened, going down the Demonic Path and becoming the major villainous boss. However, the protagonist still ruthlessly defeats him and his soul is eternally sealed.\n\nOnce Qin Mo opened his eyes, he discovered that he had become this Senior Martial Brother.>"
