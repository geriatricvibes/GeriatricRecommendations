	"description": "I possessed into an R-19 novel that I can’t even remember the title of.\n\nHow good it would be if I possessed a ‘healing story’.\n\nHowever, the person I possessed was Carla, the Countess with a cheating husband.\n\n“I swear to God, there’s no divorce.”\n\nI looked at the two men and women tangled and said with a laugh.\n\nPoor Carla, however in this novel, Carla was also a very mad woman.\n\nShe was so mad at love that she abandoned her family and even herself.\n\nBut somehow, she doesn’t feel like a stranger.\n\n“So, your dowry, I’ll take it all for you. Trust only this sister.”\n\nI decided to avenge the Count as much as Carla was hurt.\n\nI can't get caught short if I want to take the Count's fortune by taking advantage of his affair.\n\nBut…\n\n“If a beautiful person like Carla looks like that…It is difficult to find composure.”\n\nA man keeps coming close to me.>"
