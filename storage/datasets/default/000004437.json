	"description": "The end of my story, which I thought was a happy ending, was ruined.\r\n\r\n“Let’s get divorce, us.”\r\n\r\nMy husband, who fell in love with a woman other than me, trampled on me miserably.\r\n\r\nIn front of me who crumbled and chose death,\r\nA devil with sparkling purple eyes, Duke Perial appeared.\r\n\r\n“Will you sign a contract with me? I’ll give you anything you want, anything.”\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n“I’m the devil.”\r\n\r\nRed lips smiling, he spit out a sweet whisper like the ‘devil’.\r\n\r\n“Instead, I’m going to come over the window like this at every certain time to covet your night. That’s the condition of our contract.”\r\n\r\nIf I could trample the lives of those who made me this way\r\nIt’s nothing to sell all my body and soul to the devil.\r\n\r\n“The red mark engraved on that body is proof that you’re ‘mine’.”>"
