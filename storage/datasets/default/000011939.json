	"description": "The greatest demonic cultivator, He Huan, split his divine consciousness into two right before going into tribulation and created another self; whom he named He Ku.\n\nUnexpectedly, He Huan reached enlightenment, and from the demonic path entered into a path of selflessness— reaching the state of Nirvana. Yet despite no longer caring for himself, he still cared for He Ku.\n\nOh well, it wasn’t his fault for not having self-harming tendencies and therefore, reluctant to lose his other self. Since this was the case, then this road of selflessness, he won’t take it.\n\nIs there a problem with people loving themselves? Of course not.>"
