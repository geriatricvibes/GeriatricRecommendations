	"description": "I asked an information guild to arrange a matchmaking.\r\n\r\nI just needed someone to be my husband for a year.\r\n\r\nB.U.T!\r\n\r\nThe information guild chief, who heard the request, offered to be my temporary husband?\r\n\r\nHe is handsome….No, I was married because the conditions were okay, but suddenly the emperor gave my husband a title?\r\n\r\n“What? The Grand Duke of Carriard?”\r\n\r\nThat crazy warlord, murderer, the nightmare of the whole continent, that reckless guy is the incarnation of the evil who calls the blood?\r\n\r\nHelp me! I’ve been swindled!\r\n\r\n” Yeah, So?”\r\n“Well, sir! … The condition I asked for is obviously below the baron!.”\r\n“So?”\r\n“Nothing…”\r\n\r\nThe devilish red eyes glared at her. One more word and he will kill her. Will Leyrin be able to get out of her scary husband and escape a fraudulent marriage? >"
