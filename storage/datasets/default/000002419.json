	"description": "A series about a hyper-realistic fantasy game!\n\n“Sergeant First Class Ha, you crazy bastard. You shot another full round of bullseye?”\n\nThe sharpshooter Ha LeeHa simply wanted to be a part of the army forever. However, due to an unfortunate accident, he became paraplegic and was tossed back into society.\n\nThe revolutionary VR game [Middle Earth] presented a new life to him. Money obtained in [Middle Earth] has real-world value! Yet, he ruined his chance by selecting the lowest-tier character!\n\n“I’m not like the others. This is all I have.”\n\nBlack gunpowder, iron balls, and ramrods… I’ll show all of you what a real ‘musketeer’ is!>"
