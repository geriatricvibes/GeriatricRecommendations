	"description": "At a blood donation event, seeing a beautiful signature from one of the donors, she takes a piece of paper and copies it out of boredom. Suddenly bumping into a handsome guy, feeling a sense of familiarity, she thinks for a bit and glances suspiciously at the signature she just copied …… is it his?\n\nA few chance encounters, she finally meets him again at a high school reunion.\n\nUpon saying goodbye, intelligent yet quiet, sincere yet serious, coolly yet gently he asks a question: “I had written and given you a letter, do you remember?” An Ning’s mind is muddled for a long while, does this mean ….. she had turned down Xu Mo Ting?\n\nPeople usually squander time in their youth, hopefully when looking back, there are no regrets ……>"
