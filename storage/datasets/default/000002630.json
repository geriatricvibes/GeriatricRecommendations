Humanoid beast….\n\nBecause a female immortal sealed a mischievous and sly fox spirit into his right hand, ordinary senior high school student Liu Yi henceforth began his extraordinary journey as a immortal practitioner.\n\nThe fox spirit said:\n\n“The prettiest girls in the class, the daughters of rich families, the evil female cult members, the beautiful women in the world of immortals? All these beauties are no longer a dream!\n\nCome, become an immortal and even a diaosi could counterattack!\n\nCome, become an immortal and kill all of the tall, rich and handsome!\n\nCome, become an immortal and capture all the beauties!”\n\n“Liu Yi, I said to capture all the beauties; not to capture me!
