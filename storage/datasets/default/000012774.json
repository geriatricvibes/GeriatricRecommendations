	"description": "High society CEO Big BOSS Lu expresses that he’s felt stifled recently. Ever since a woof style creature intruded upon his home, his life has become a complete mess. A slight conflict in opinion and his couch is hijacked, his desk seized, his lap forcefully occupied, even his bed was forcefully dominated!\n\nThe small Samoyed, with his head resting upon his waste removal official’s thigh and four paws facing the sky exposing a soft little belly, with a face full of untainted purity and a pair of innocent eyes: “Woof~”\n\nBig BOSS Lu lowers his head and makes eye contact for three seconds : “…. Give give give! Whatever you want, I will give it to you!”>"
