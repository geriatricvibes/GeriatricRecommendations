	"description": "Luo Fei does not fear being rivals in love with Xi Yanqing; what he fears is that they have transmigrated to ancient times and become betrothed to each other!\n\nFather Luo: Eh?! Not getting married? How about I break your legs if you don’t get married?!\n\nLuo Fei: Dad, ahh, Dad! Aiyo, stop beating me now! I’ll just go get married okay?\n\nXi Yanqing: You know that you can’t escape and now you’ll have to pay for it. Did you leave without bringing your IQ?\n\nLuo Fei: You with the surname Xi doesn’t have to sleep on the bed on the wedding night!\n\nXi Yanqing: Oh.\n\nLuo Fei, who, on his wedding night, was pressed to the trunk of a peach tree at the entrance: … F*ck you, surnamed Xi! This isn’t what I meant!!!>"
