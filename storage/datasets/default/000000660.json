	"description": "I transmigrated to the Great Qin empire to find myself a famous good-for-nothing in Ye Manor and the subject of ridicule of everyone. But thankfully, my dantian is the planet Earth. \r\n\r\nWhen the Earthlings cultivate and comprehend anything, it will also turn into my own cultivation and comprehension. Each time one more Earthling reaches First Honor Inborn Level, I'd be able to add on the strength of an First Honor Inborn Level to my own strength. \r\n\r\nThere are 1.4 billion people on this Earth. I've hit jackpot.>"
