	"description": "He transmigrates into each world as a cannon fodder. The original cannon fodder would always be pregnant when he transmigrates over. He was forced to be a father in every world. \n\nIt’s impossible for him to have the child unless… \n\nThe former campus king: I will give you 10 million yuan if you have the child. \nXu Ze: Okay. \n\nRich man: I will give you 100 million yuan if you leave immediately after giving birth. \nXu Ze: No problem. \n\nThe slag film emperor: I will give you 200 million, so give me the child. \nXu Ze: Okay. \n\nCEO: I will give you one billion yuan. You worked hard. \nXu Ze: Deal. \n\nAfter the deal was sealed, the slag men would chase after him with their child. \n\nXu Ze: This has nothing to do with me.>"
