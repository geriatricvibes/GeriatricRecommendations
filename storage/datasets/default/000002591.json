	"description": "During an excursion with an eccentric acquaintance, I am accused of breaking the Gion Festival Ordinance by a burly posse. Seized and taken on a whirlwind tour through Yoiyama, I come face-to-face with a gallery of exotic, grotesque characters. But who's this 'Lord Yoiyama' that they all seem to revere? (Yoiyama Goldfish)\r\n\r\nI wake up, only to find that today is Yoiyama... just like yesterday was, and the day before that. How in the world am I going to find a way to escape this loop? (Yoiyama Maze)\r\n\r\nA collection of strange and wonderful short stories, weaving in and out through the backdrop of the Gion Festival's Yoiyama. Morimi takes you into a fantastical world where the colors of fantasy and reality blur into each other like a kaleidoscope.>"
