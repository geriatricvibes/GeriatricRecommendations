	"description": "“When you fall from a high place, there is no one to catch, let alone pick you up.”\r\n\r\nRei understood this best when her family fell from glory straight into the gutter. She understood her value better, when she was chased out of her own house- she was nothing. At the moment she was about to crumble, she looked at her older brother standing by her.\r\n\r\nShe was not alone. Not all was lost…\r\n\r\nIn the hopes of rekindling an old connection and start afresh, the path the siblings took led them to a quiet countryside.\r\n\r\nA resplendent castle covered in beautiful red roses… so majestic… so sinister…\r\n\r\nIt also looked like… a lonely abode shrouded in desolation?\r\n\r\nAnd there, she met someone; it seems he was…\r\n\r\n… a beast.>"
