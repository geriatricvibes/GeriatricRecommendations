	"description": "I possessed a villainess in a Novel. For some reason, however, I keep returning to when I was eight years old every sixteen years. This life is the fourth.\n\nCome to think of it, I think I also return when the second male lead dies. But why did he die? The original hasn’t even started yet?!\n\nDon’t tell me, is it because I don’t live like the original?\n\nSo I started to live according to the original.\n\n…But what was the problem?\n\n“How did you get so big? When you were young, you were so small and cute.”\n\n“Because you raised me like this.”\n\n“Did I?”\n\nWhen did I? I only remember bothering him like a villain though?\n\nI looked up at him with a questioning look.\n\nThen he lifted his finger and pointed it at my head.\n\n“You read a book to me.”\n\nAnd then he pointed at my lips.\n\n“It made me realize the magic.”\n\nAnd then my hands.\n\n“I practiced sword.”\n\nLastly, at the heart.\n\n“You taught me what I don’t know.”\n\nHe, who was speaking in a low voice, grabbed my hand and stroked my head.\n\n“You’re the one who made me do this, and you shouldn’t say that anymore. No matter how big I am, you should keep loving me.”>"
