	"description": "The world had turned into a game and was invaded by monsters. At this very moment, teachers, flight attendants, students, bosses, and workers…\n\nRegardless of their occupations, everyone had been transformed into a player under the management of the Trojans. They were forced into playing a deadly survival game, competing for the title of the [Strongest Player on Earth]!\n\nThe game would also be live-streamed on the Star Channel with the highest ratings. The better the players performed, the more points they would receive. These points could be used to purchase items or people that have appeared in the past, the present, and from digital worlds.\n\nPlayers, zombie high school girls in sailor suits wielding samurai swords, and the evil god Cthulhu who causes insanity will always be on your tail.\n\nDo your best to clear the game! Become the strongest player!\n\nSun Yuan lowered his head and glanced at his phone. Why are these game settings the same as the mobile game I had just cleared?>"
