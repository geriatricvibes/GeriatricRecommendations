	"description": "Miyata Ippei’s status when thrown into another world was just terrible. He only has 8 points in his HP while his Attack and Defense is 3 and 5 points respectively. He can't use any attack magic and if he engaged in a fight then the instant death status is sure to be unavoidable. His recovery magic and crafting skills, however, were prominent. This is the man who aspires to be an adventurer more than anyone.>"
