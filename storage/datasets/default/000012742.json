	"description": "I transmigrated into a book I read before dying.\r\nInto the body of the corrupted Saintess, Yvelina, who bullied the heroine, Iris.\r\n\r\nYvelina is destined to burn at the stake in two years.\r\n\r\nI can't die like this.\r\n\r\nWouldn't I be able to survive if I worked hard to fix my mistakes and create amicable relationships with the male leads who drive Yvelina to death?\r\n\r\nBut things didn't go my way, and Yvelina, who is the owner of the body, put out unreasonable conditions, saying I should do as I'm told if I wish to stay in her body.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was out of my own will, and other times it wasn't, but I tried to survive by forming relationships with the male leads of the story...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI know it well.\r\nEveryone is treating me well because I'm the 'saintess'.\r\nSo when the moment when I'm no longer the Saintess comes, all these relationships will end.>"
