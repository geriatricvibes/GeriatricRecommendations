	"description": "'I didn't expect you to deceive me.'\r\n\r\n“…….”\r\n\r\n'Such a useless act.'\r\n\r\nThese were the words of a man who came along with knights.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed, Luce shook her head, but had no idea who he was or why he was doing this.\r\n\r\nAs Luce slowly retreated in the overbearing atmosphere, the man embraced Luce's waist.\r\n\r\n'Why. When the last time you begged for me to fill you.”\r\n\r\nLuce, who was trying to push him away, could not do anything because he took off his robe.\r\n\r\n“It seems you now remember who I am?”\r\n\r\nShe remembered.\r\n\r\nHe...… was the first man she had mixed bodies with.>"
