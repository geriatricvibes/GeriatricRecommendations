For as long as he can remember, he’s been stumbling across murder scenes or receiving mysterious attache cases to transport. \n\nWhen he met Siesta, a brilliant detective fighting a secret war against an organization of pseudohumans, he couldn’t resist the call to become her assistant and join her on an epic journey across the world. \n\n...Until a year ago, that is. Now he’s returned to a life that is normal and tepid by comparison, knowing the adventure must be over. \n\nAfter all, the detective is already dead.>"
