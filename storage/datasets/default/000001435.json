As he reaches middle age, his family is desperate for a child.\r\n\r\nUntil one day...\r\n\r\n'Mr. Qin, your son is already in primary school!'\r\n\r\n'???' I have only had one boyfriend!\r\n\r\nSeven years after the breakup, the old lover returned to the wealthy family with a little fat pig in his arms: 'Zaizai is a big eater, I can't feed him. Zaizai’s primary school homework is too difficult, I can’t do it. I'll give you guardianship from now on! Will you let me go to your construction site to move bricks? Son, say ‘Mommy’!'\r\n\r\nMr. Qin: (No, I couldn't give birth to such a fat kid!)\r\n\r\nLater...\r\n\r\nOnlookers: I heard that Mr. Qin has adopted an illegitimate child born to his old lover by some woman?\r\n\r\nMr. Qin: Let me introduce to you, this is my own cub!>"
