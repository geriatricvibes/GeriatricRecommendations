	"description": "Emily Adesio, with the Academy Acceptance Certificate in her hands, enters the academy, dreaming of a happy school life, but is unexpectedly caught up in an incident.\r\n\r\nEthan Valenti, who helped her by chance, is gradually drawn to Emily, and Emily is also shaken by his aggressive approach…\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBefore Emily could feel a strange sense of relief when he stopped, he grabbed the waist-high window railing with his right hand and easily jumped over into the building.\r\n\r\n'…What?'\r\n\r\nIn an instant, a black shadow fell over Emily, who was startled by the sudden narrow distance. It was because Lord Valenti, who was much taller than her, was looking down at her with his back against the window.\r\n\r\nAs the shadow cast around her, Emily instinctively tried to back off. But before she could even move, Valenti reached out to grab the handkerchief she held out.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Emily. It was very kind of you, but you didn't have to return it.'\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe sweet romance story of Emily, who is ordinary but always surrounded by unordinary situations, and Ethan, who dedicated his first and last love to her.\r\n>"
