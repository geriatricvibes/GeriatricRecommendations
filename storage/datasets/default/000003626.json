	"description": "I was reincarnated as a young lady who had no importance in the novel.\n\nMy goal is to live a peaceful life!\n\nHowever, I met all the main leads of the original story in kindergarten.\n\nI can’t believe I’m meeting all the main characters!\n\n“What are you looking at? Get out of the way.”\n\n“……This body is scheduled for early admission to the Academy soon. The level is not right.”\n\n“How dare the young lady think to talk to me!”\n\nFor a moment I was delighted, but somehow no one seems to be very pleased with me.\n\nBut I can’t miss the chance to build a solid network with future heroes!\n\nSo I started getting close to them one by one……\n\nWhen I woke up, everyone was fighting each other to take my side.\n\nOh, what should I do with these dummies?>"
