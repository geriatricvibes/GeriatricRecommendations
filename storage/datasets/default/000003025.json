	"description": "She is intelligent, beautiful, calm, and professional. As the youngest chief forensic investigator for the past few years, her future was very bright. All of this, however, changed with a bizarre time-travel.\n\nHer face was now destroyed. All right. But unexpectedly she was also a “gift” from a small kingdom! Her life deviated from the initial course. By her side would from time to time emerge bizarre and bewildering incidents. She makes painstaking investigations, unravels the layers of mysteries, pleads for justice on behalf of the living ones, and redresses injustices for the dead. There have been no vengeful spirits under her knife!\n\nJust as everything has settled down, as she looked back, she was inwardly glad. One life, one world, two-people. Today’s mistaken marriage is only to be tied with you.>"
