	"description": "Su Yan adored Xie Yu for many years and finally got what she wanted, but Xie Yu ran away on the wedding day, making her a laughing stock. At that time, Bai Xingfan appeared in front of her. He held a black umbrella in his skeletal hand to shield her from the heavy rain, and the other hand stretched out in front of her with a gentle and determined voice: 'Don't be afraid, still With me.' Su Yan was stunned with tears in her eyes for a long time, and finally, she reached out to Bai Xingfan.>"
