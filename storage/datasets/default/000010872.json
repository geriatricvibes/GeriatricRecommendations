	"description": "Kiriki Junka was a high school student and a self styled detective with unparalleled beauty; however, he was a highly eccentric individual. His partner Suzaku Rouji spent his days being dragged around by him as the two of them were faced with many mysteries: a painting that cried tears of blood, chalk that somebody broke, the strange actions of an old man in a coffee shop…\r\n\r\nThe curtain is raised on this fresh school-mystery-comedy.\r\n\r\nBookmark; write your comments, critiques, and reviews; and sink your teeth in!>"
