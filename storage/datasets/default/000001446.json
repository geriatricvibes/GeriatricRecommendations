	"description": "Set on a giant, almost finished bridge between Sadogashima and Niigata. Abandoned by the government, the bridge, and the giant man-made floating island at the center, has become a city of criminals and societal drop-outs. \n\nSet in the same world as Durarara, but 15-20 years later. There is almost no overlap between Etsusa Bridge and the other novels.>"
