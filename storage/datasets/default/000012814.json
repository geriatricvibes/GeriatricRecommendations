	"description": "I am the developer of the reverse harem game , which is about to be released.\r\nOne day, when I suddenly lost consciousness and woke up, I possessed the villainous princess [Therese] of the game I made.\r\nI can’t even.\r\n\r\n[Let's start the broadcast.]\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by a broadcast? This is a setup that isn’t in the game.\r\nA rainbow-haired man in a bright red suit appeared in front of me in the middle of the confusion.\r\n\r\n'I'm Ozworld, a channel manager. If you compare it to the world you lived in, it's like a broadcast PD. However, the target is not humans, but the Constellations.'\r\n\r\nTak!\r\nA quest popped up when the channel manager flicked his finger.\r\n\r\n[Quest:  See the true ending in hard mode]\r\n*Compensation: End of Broadcast\r\n*Failure: Death\r\n\r\nThe condition of the true ending is to be connected with one of the four male protagonists.\r\nBut Theresa, who I possessed, is the villainess with the worst compatibility with all the male characters and dozens of death routes where she died in their hands!\r\n \r\n'I hope you will become a BJ of a big channel.'\r\n\r\nWill I be able to safely end the broadcast and run away from this game?>"
