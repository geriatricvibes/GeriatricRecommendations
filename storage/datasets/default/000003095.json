	"description": "A world where only people born into a noble family can use magic.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was a commoner, Ars, had a great magic talent, he was called《Cursed Blood》and was forced to live an oppressed life.\r\n\r\nHe was banished from his family home at a very young age and spent ten years training as a magician.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 15, Ars is encouraged to attend a magic academy to become an《Official Magician》.\r\n\r\nWhen he showed up at the gate of the academy, what awaited him was a group of nobles who were at a very low level.\r\n\r\n[It's stupid. This kind of naive thinking will not work in real battles.]\r\n\r\nArs who is enrolled in an academy full of noblemen, begins an unusual life as the only《ordinary person》in the academy.>"
