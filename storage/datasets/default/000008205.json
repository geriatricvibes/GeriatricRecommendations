	"description": "In his previous life, Tang Shi was a cannon fodder. For a jerk, he even turned down a blind date his father arranged for him, but finally died in the hands of his lover and half-blooded elder brother.\n\nBefore he died, his elder brother told him that the one that always went against him, teased him and used him as a bait was the one who truly loved him, also that blind date his father had arranged for him—Yan Xu.\n\nFeeling regretful?\n\nWhat would have happened if he hadn’t made that kind of choice from the very beginning?>"
