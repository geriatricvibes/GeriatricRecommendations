	"description": "The night before we obtained our marriage certificate, I asked him, “When did you start to develop feelings for me?”\n\nHe answered, “I don’t remember.”\n\n“But, why me?”\n\n“Why not you?”\n\n“I’m very petty, and I get jealous very easily.”\n\n“So am I.”\n\n“I’m afraid I’m not worthy of you.”\n\n“So am I.”\n\n“I haven’t really dated, so I don’t know what love is.”\n\n“I don’t know either.”\n\nHe held my hand gently, “But I know this. When I think about spending the rest of my life with you, I feel that my future is filled with hope.”\n\nAt 16, we used the same class desk, with less than 10cm between our arms. My peripheral vision was full of him.\n\nAt 26, I woke up in the morning, and saw the sunlight softly shining on his face. I thought, this is how I want to grow old – gradually, together, with him.\n\nI guess this must be love.>"
