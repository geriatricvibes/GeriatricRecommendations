	"description": "After the legalization of same-s*x marriage, Tong Qiu didn’t expect to be part of the first batch of people shoved onto the marriage market. A relative set him up with a man who had a handsome face and a great body – a police officer who used to work for the criminal investigation unit but became a uniformed officer after suffering an injury. Tong Qiu had a uniform fetish and the two of them got along and so, under the excessive urging of both of their families, they decided to tie the knot. \n\nBefore their wedding, they agreed that if they were incompatible after a year of marriage, they would get divorced and part amicably. \n\nA year later, Tong Qiu said, “Huo Zhixing, let’s file for a divorce.”\n\nHuo Zhixing’s friend asked him, “He said he wanted a divorce and you just agreed?”\n\nHuo Zhixing: “Of course I agreed. We have to respect other people’s decisions. If he wants a divorce, then he can have a divorce. All I have to do is win him back.”>"
