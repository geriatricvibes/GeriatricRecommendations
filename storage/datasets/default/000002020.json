	"description": "One day he suddenly found himself in hell. \nAll he had was the desire to live and a predation ability.\nFrom the first to the ninth thousand circles of hell, he absorbed dozens, hundreds of thousands of demons.\nEven the seven great dukes of hell bowed down before him.\n\n– Why would you wish to go back? Doesn't his highness have everything that’s in Hell?\n– What do I have?\n\nNothing to eat, nothing to enjoy!\nThe only things in Hell are the barren lands and terrible demons!\n\n“I'm going back.”\n\nAfter ten thousand years he returns to Earth.>"
