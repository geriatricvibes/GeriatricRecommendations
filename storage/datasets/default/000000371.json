	"description": "After death, Gu Jin realized the child, whom she had fed only once in the past, was the only person who gave her proper burial and avenged her by any means. Once she’s reborn, she found him when he was being bullied. And despite objections, Gu Jin took this malnourished child under her care with help from the dimension in her possession. However, never did she expect she would lead him astray... \r\n\r\nMany years later, Gu Jin can’t help gritting her teeth as she is watching the elegant and handsome man on TV. He has grown up to be a successful and powerful businessman who is outwardly kind but inwardly ruthless. Most unexpectedly, he has turned into a man who is domineering and protective of her. \r\n\r\n>"
