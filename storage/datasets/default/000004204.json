	"description": "Photophobia, bloodthirsty, immortality... Colin, who passed through, found that he seemed to be in line with the characteristics of the vampires.

[Under direct sunlight, the strength is reduced by about 30%], [The throat, heart, and brain are no longer fatal weaknesses], [Ordinary food cannot satisfy hunger, only blood can restore physical strength]. Holy water...Huh? Who gave me holy water!>"
