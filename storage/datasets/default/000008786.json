	"description": "I was possessed as an extra character who hands money to her husband’s mistress but I didn’t want to be a character who dies from the stress that her husband and his mistress gave her. So-\n\n“I-I can’t accept something like this. No matter how much you give me, I won’t break up with the Duke!”\n\n“That’s the spirit.”\n\nI met the mistress in secret.\n\nAnd just like in the original work, I handed her a white envelope.\n\n“Keep flirting with him.”\n\nI decided that since I had a good family and nothing to lose, I would be better off without a husband like that.\n\nI’m going to enjoy my happy, fancy, single life, so you guys can just continue loving each other!>"
