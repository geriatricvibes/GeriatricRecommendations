	"description": "A world after humans. Tolk, a ‘castle’ floating in space where cats and their robot partners dance in deadly zero-G duels. A certain cult of the cats, the Skywalkers, have conducted research that denies the foundation of the whole cat religion.\n\nNow the last Skywalker is trying to complete their blasphemous work and achieve the dream of his people. To go where only the dead are said to go. To descend, in the flesh, to the holy land of Earth.\n\nToo bad his robot partner is a little girl robot with more than a few little bugs to work out.>"
