When the Nine supremes were ambushed and killed at Tianxuan Cliff, Yun Yang was the only one to escape the massacre albeit with heavy internal injuries. Watch as he takes revenge for his brothers against all those involved.\n\n- - - - - -\n\nHeavenly order has flaws, humanly world has injustice\n\nCast aside romance, for evils prevail\n\nMisery brings forth kindness, rage won’t lead to disputes\n\nBeyond principles and rules, let me carry out the execution\n\nSpread my might in the world, slaughter injustice of the world\n\nBlade in hand, passion in heart;\n\nPassing judgement for life or death, sentenced by heroes with the blade,\n\nStaring at the world with cold eyes, I have no regrets in my life\n>"
