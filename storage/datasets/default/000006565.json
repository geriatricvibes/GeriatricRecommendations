	"description": "Sato Koharu is a pretty girl that everyone can recognize.\n\nBut her attitude with anyone is so bitter that she got nicknamed “salt-god Sato-san.” Anyone who tried to get close to her got emotionally injured in a brutal way.\n\nThough for some reason, I was able to save Sato-san from pick-up boys where I was working at. Which made her like me, and thus I became a friend of “salt-god Sato-san.”\n\nIn front of everyone, she is a salt-god, but in front of me, she is so sweet. This is a high school life story between Sato-san and I.>"
