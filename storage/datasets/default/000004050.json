	"description": "There is an amusement park that is only open during the night.\n\n It is said that special invitations are handed out exclusively for specific guests. \n\nHow is the amusement park still operating when there's hardly a single guest a day?\n\n 'What's wrong with you these days? Are you sick? Had a mishap?'\n\n -An unlucky man\n\n 'This is a service? If it is, then is the service freezing us to death?' \n\n-A woman infuriated because of her curiosity.\n\n'Even if you don't bring it up, I'm already like this.' \n\n-And another one.\n\n This is the tale of these three people. \n\nCome see the dubious story unravel in this suspicious amusement park.\n\n We'll show you the sinister backstory of a beautiful fairytale and the unusual faces of the fine and gentle characters of the fairytale. \n\nOh, of course, we can't miss out on the bizarre love stories, can we? \n\nBecause this is a fairy tale.>"
