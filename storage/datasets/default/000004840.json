	"description": "In this world, there is: Confucianism; Taoism; Buddhism, Demons, and Magicians. Xu Qi’an, a graduate from the police academy, suddenly finds himself waking up in prison, to be exiled to the border three days later ...\n\nHis initial goal was to protect himself in this world with no laws, and to be able to live a leisurely life as a rich man..\n\nMany years later, Xu Qi’an looks back on the past, and the long-dead enemies and friends, as well as the numerous bones he has left behind.\n\nAs the Yangtze River flows eastward, the waves wash away the heroes; right and wrong, success or failure will all turn into nothing but history. However, just like the sun’s rays gleaming over the towering mountains, after the sunset, a new sun will rise.>"
