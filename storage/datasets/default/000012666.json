	"description": "According to Legend, the Unicorn Legion heroically protects the people from harm by powerful magical creatures.\n\nThe elven hero Ellen, after sleeping for three hundred years, wakes up to the world while wanting to rebuild the legion — only to find that all the magical creatures in the continent are all extinct! Is our hero out of a job!?\n\nWith no news of old comrades; with new comrades being unfathomable; having his pace be repeatedly messed up, Captain Ellen feels wrong from his pointy ears down to his foot. — Dear Captain, enjoy the culture shock of a new era!>"
