	"description": "Every being has a spirit. Inevitably there will be some individuals, or some incidents, that we have never came across.\n\nSix years ago, it was rumored that a mystical giant python was facing it’s transformation. The news attracted hunters all over the world to Kunlun Mountain. At the end, the giant python died and Lin Shuo was the only hunter who survived and had since retired into the remote mountains.\n\nSix years later, a piece of giant python scale appeared in front of Lin Shuo. The giant python who had failed to transform survived.\n\nLin Shuo decided to embark on a journey again in order to find out the truth from six years ago.>"
