	"description": "A visually impaired fortune teller who had set up stall at the entrance of the alleyway once told me, “Your love life is destined to be tragically entangled with a man, and it will not come to a good end.”\n\nMy payment to him was a half-drank soda can stuffed into his hands.\n\nI walked away with an air of indignation. “Hey, you haven’t paid!”\n\nHis yelling was still audible from a few blocks away. \n\nAre you for real, you could not even tell if your customer is a man or a woman, what fortune can you possibly tell?\n\nCount yourself lucky I did not thrash your stall. \n\nSitting here at the train station, with my cheeks swelling into the size of a pig’s head, disheveled clothes, both hands empty, I recalled the words of the fortune teller.\n\nI regret not paying my dues and a bit more to him.\n\nIt is a pity before today, I have been living the life of a fool.\n\nNot only did I not redeem myself from being involved with a man, I did not discern that I will never come to a good end……..\n\n~ My story is dedicated to everyone who have entered my life, those who stayed and those who left. One of my favorite poet said: “There is a story, the one and only story that deserves to be told in its entirety.”\n\nTo me, this is exactly what I need to tell. ~>"
