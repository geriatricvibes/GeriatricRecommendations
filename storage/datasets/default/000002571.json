	"description": "Chen Du only called Chen Jiashu sister in bed.\n\nHe panted in her ear as he confessed, over and over again, “I like you, sister, only you.”\n\nChen Jiashu was immersed in the afterglow, her consciousness blurred, but she knew he had missed a word. He only liked to f*ck her.\n\nSeduced her younger half-brother to take revenge on the stepmother that wrecked her family, she inadvertently transformed a harmless sheep into a big bad wolf.>"
