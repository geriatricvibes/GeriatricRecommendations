	"description": "He experienced disappointment, being let down, and had experienced the ups and downs of life yet he still retained the heart of a young person. To be sincere, to be magnanimous, to love what I love, and to hate what I hate. \n\nAnd he said, I don’t care anymore, the blood I spilled out, someone will definitely come and collect it.\n\nThat day in the elegant tea hall, the sound of the pipa carried through the hall, and like a love disease, flustered the heart.\n\nOne was full of expectation, one fell in love at first sight.>"
