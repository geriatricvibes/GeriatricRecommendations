	"description": "It's boring if you only read love stories, right?\n\nTry this novel. But don’t read it alone! Make sure there’s someone with you since you might start feeling strange. Or you might just hallucinate about things that shouldn’t be. This novel is not for those with a weak spirit but for those who want to work their mind and strengthen their heart. The more you read, the more you will think and faster your heart will beat. Don’t believe me? Try it…>"
