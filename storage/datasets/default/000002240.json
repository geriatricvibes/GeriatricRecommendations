	"description": "Lin Anran, an artist with long hair, is an introvert who doesn't like to leave his house. After his abusive mother left him, she left him an apartment so he began to live alone against what his aunt recommended. Then he met someone. Someone who truly understood him. \n\nThe psychiatrist that Lin Anran saw, “In short, that ‘person’ is only a figment of your mental delusion called erotomania. You feel that the other person is secretly conveying love, and is even secretly showing you love in a TV interview, but in fact, you both have no contact at all in reality. Everything is just your imagination.”\n\nThe man in suit and tie that Lin Anran saw when he got home, “Ranran, you’re finally back.”\n\n“Erotomania is a rare mental illness in which the patient falls into the delusion that another person (usually someone with a higher social status) is in love with him.” (From Baidu Encyclopedia)>"
