As long as he could destroy the feelings between the two protagonists and stop the destruction of the world, he would be able to overturn the tragic end of his original world. \n\nYue Chu didn’t hesitate to accept the offer. From then on, he began to earnestly study the art of being green tea, walking farther and farther down the path of being green tea.\n\nBut why did the green tea keep on targeting the wrong person??>"
