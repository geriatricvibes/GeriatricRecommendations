	"description": "An Immortal does not differentiate between good and evil, nor do they care about the distinction between black and white. They do not ask what is right or wrong, and consider all living things as dogs. In spite of everything, Immortals pursue the Dao with bitter resolve. \r\n\r\nAny being who disturbs my Dao, good or evil, will be forced to meet their karma, reduced to nothing more than ashes.>"
