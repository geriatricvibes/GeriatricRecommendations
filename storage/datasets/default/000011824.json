However, the Duke, who was unaware of this fact, simply thought she had amnesia and send her off to marry the second prince of Rennes Empire. \n\nLittle did she know that the second prince was cursed by an evil wizard and turned him into a dog during the day and could only turn back to a human at night. \n\nWhat’s worse, she even named it “tofu” after she found it wandering in the Imperial Palace.\n\n Who would have known it was her own husband!>"
