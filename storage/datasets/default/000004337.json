	"description": "Shu Shi country’s Little Prince fell in love at first sight with the eldest son of Qi family. He declared: If it’s not the general, I will never get married!\n\nThe Emperor was furious: Three generations of the Qi family are all generals. Qi Nanke is their eldest son, how can he give his hand to you in marriage?\n\nThe aggrieved Little Prince sighed regretfully: Then, I can give my hand to him.\n\nQi Nanke heard the news. He quickly returned to Royal City to break the engagement, but halfway through, he met the Little Prince who had snuck out from the Royal City.\n\nLittle Prince traveled a thousand miles to see his husband. Who would have thought he would encounter mountain bandits and was even coincidentally saved by Qi Nanke?\n\n—\n\nThe Little Prince squeaked out mandarin in Shu Shi’s dialect: It can’t be, it can’t be! How could my white moonlight grow up to be like this?\n\nQi Nanke: …\n\nLittle Prince: Don’t touch this daddy!! (`皿′)>"
