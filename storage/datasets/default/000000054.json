Well then, I guess I have to protect his chastity?\n\n“You can sleep on the floor then.”\n\n“What?” His eyes said he didn’t want to.\n\nWell, yeah. The floor was hard. Then it couldn’t be helped.\n\n“I’ll just hold your hand and sleep. You trust me, right?”\n\nBut, how come the bed broke on my first night with my husband?\n\n*\n\nAristine, a princess confined out of the Emperor’s sight.\n\nWhen in reality, she was the owner of the [Monarch’s Sight], able to see the future, past, and present.\n\nShe, who became the sacrifice for a political marriage, was married off to a terrifying barbarian…\n\n“The most precious things should naturally be given to my bride.”\n\nBut her husband, whose monstrosity she prepared for, was way too normal.\n\nHowever, he belonged to someone else.\n\n‘I’ll go make money then.’\n\nShe might as well make the goldfields her own.\n\n*\n\nCan Aristine really achieve her dream of living freely on a pile of money?\n\nOr will she end up killing two birds with one stone?>"
