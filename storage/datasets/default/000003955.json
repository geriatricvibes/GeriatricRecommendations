	"description": "Villians, what are they?\n\nAre they cunning, insidious, and evil?\n\nNo!\n\nWhen the villain turns against the protagonist there is no escape.\n\nRather than becoming a villain destined to be slapped by the protagonist, Li Xiao pursued a different path.\n\nHe say to the son of luck who obtained the immortal cultivation heritage, “I’m your master!”\n\nThe City’s God of War says, “No! I’m the protagonist, I’m the son of heaven’s destiny.”\n\nDoes the protagonist have high martial arts skills?\n\nSo what? I had already breakthrough the Immortal Realm.\n\nThe protagonist is the immortal cultivator? So what? Likewise, I am one.\n\nThe Reincarnated Immortal Emperor? Sorry, but I’m already an immortal emperor.>"
