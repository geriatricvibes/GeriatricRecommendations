	"description": "I suddenly possessed Leah Prezis, the fiancee of a second male lead and the vindictive evil woman resented by the readers. With the betrayal of the female protagonist and her fiance, I put my everything into changing the fate of Leah, the wicked woman. \n\n“I’m going to ask you to break our engagement. ”\n\nFinally, I asked for a breakup in order to escape from the barbaric death ending, and he said, “I can’t do that.” \n\nWhat? You can’t do that now? \n\nAnd I never thought I’d get hit in the back of my head right before I managed to escape from the terrible fate of Leah Prezis. \n\n“Why, do you want me to beg you not to leave, on my knees?”\n\nWhen I saw a certain man’s persistent smile, there was only one thought that came to my mind: No, you’re crazy!>"
