	"description": "Due to an accidental transmigration and a strange combination of circumstances, a forensic expert had mistakenly ended up as the wandering son of a valued noble. With difficulties that others would not expect, he had gone from being a bogus countryside Buddhist monk to taking up the role of a rich family son. Besides, a similar constitution to Conan had also made his life sufferable.\n\nIt seems like a better choice to resume one’s old profession of performing post-mortem examinations and crack cases instead of being a silent good looking boy.>"
