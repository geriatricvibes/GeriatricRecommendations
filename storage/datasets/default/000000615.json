	"description": "Callius von Jervain.\n\nA character who dies no matter what he does. A character who falls into a forced choice route where he can only die, no matter his choices up to that point. However, there is a single route where the character can live and play the game.\n\nAnd I have to carve out that route somehow.\n\nBecause I’ve become Callius von Jervain in the game.>"
