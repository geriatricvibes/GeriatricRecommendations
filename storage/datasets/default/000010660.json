The so-called Snark are a group of people who transplant the organs of criminals, gaining special powers that way.\n\nA newly recruited detective, whose enthusiasm for his job makes him stand out, is ordered to pair up with one of those Snarks. “Am I supposed to be working with a monster?” In front of the protesting Ash appeared an older gentleman with a cold personality, the complete opposite of Ash himself.\n\nThe man didn’t reveal his special powers, nor did he cooperate with the investigation.\n\n“An insincere monster!”  “A spoiled young master.”\n\nWill the two of them, unable to stomach each other, keep on butting heads?>"
