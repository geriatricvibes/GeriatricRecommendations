	"description": "“The witching hour is drawing near…”\n\n“The witching hour…?”\n\nBack in the days when I was suffering from chuunibyou, I met a girl. I, The Black Dragon knight (delusional) and the Witch of Hades (delusional), hit it off and deepened our relationship, but somehow we stopped seeing each other.\n\nI occasionally remembered that time as a part of my black history. Until she transferred to my school during my second year of high school!\n\n“I’m normal now. I’ll curse you to death if you talk about that time.”\n\n“Farewell, Benihana, the witch of Hades! That meeting is now a dream. We shall never meet again, for you have become an ordinary human being.”\n\n“My name is Benihana, Hades is the ruler of death, death is eternal, and I am immortal! I’m only hiding for the time being.”\n\nThis is a love story about a girl who is trying to act normal in high school and a boy who can’t quite graduate from Chuunibyou, who meet again and become attracted to each other>"
