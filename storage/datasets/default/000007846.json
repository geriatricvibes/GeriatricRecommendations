	"description": "–The demon race burned, slaughtered, plundered, and murdered for money.\r\n\r\nThe demon king nodded: It’s me.\r\n\r\n–The demon race is ruthless and cunning, full of evil.\r\n\r\nThe demon king was satisfied: Correct.\r\n\r\n–The demon race is masked with iron fangs, fierce and evil.\r\n\r\nThe demon king was pleased: True!\r\n\r\n–The demon race is ambitious. They raise wicked beasts in captivity and lurk within the country’s capital, gathering information. Their hearts are impure!\r\n\r\nThe demon king: ……?\r\n\r\n–Hero from afar, ah. Please lead the army, drive out the monsters, and help innocent citizens return to their homeland!\r\n\r\nThe demon king raised his head. He saw a familiar figure make a solemn declaration to the few defeated soldiers lined up, and he felt that life had become just black and white again.\r\n\r\nThis is a series of stories about a hero who intends to save the princess, but in the end ‘saves’ the demon king by mistake. It’s not a serious western fantasy.\r\n\r\nBrave, persevering, upright and kind-hearted classic (but directionally challenged) Hero x Cleanliness-is-more-prosperous-than-beauty shameless Demon King.>"
