You fake saint!”\n\nPrince Alexander cursed me like that.\n\nEveryone shouted in surprise.\n\n“Elvira is not the saint?”\n\n“There must be some mistake.”\n\nThere was no doubt about it.\n\nI was supposed to be recognized as a legitimate saint in this ceremony.\n\nBut then, all of a sudden, he called me a fake saint.\n\nFurthermore, Prince Alexander declared,\n\n“I can’t marry a woman who isn’t a saint! Your betrothal is forgotten!”\n\nThen, for the first time, I opened my mouth.\n\n“ーYes, I understand.”>"
