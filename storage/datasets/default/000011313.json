	"description": "The spring I became a second-year high schooler. When I saw the transfer student from the class next door, I remembered the memories from my past life. In this world that was from a game that I loved from my previous life, I was a nameless mob. But even though I’m a mob, it doesn’t matter! That’s because this world has Kurogane Taiga, my favorite and the one I love the most! As long as he’s here, I’m happy! My favorite existing is my happiness! –I carelessly told him my feelings, and from there, our strange relationship started.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to give monetary offerings to Taiga-san as thanks for existing…”\r\n“Stop it.”\r\n\r\nThe high-energy female mob today as well confesses her love to her favorite chara!>"
