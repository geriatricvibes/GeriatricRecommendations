	"description": "The worst thing that Shui Ruoshan thinks he ever did?\n- He wrote the story of “The Strongest King in History”.\n\nThe unluckiest thing that happened to him?\n- He transmigrated into the novel he wrote.\n\nThe most depressing thing that happened to him?\n- His current character doesn’t exist in the original story.\n\nThe most frustrating thing that happened to him?\n- His current progress completely overturned the original plot.\n\nOther than that, the most unreasonable thing is that he is actually being sheltered by the villain BOSS. \n\nThe YY, the level-ups and the ‘cool text‘ in the story that he wrote, why the hell did it suddenly change  ‘flavor’?\n\nIt must be because his way of transmigration was not quite right!\nHe wants a redo!!!\n\nNote :\n- YY is OP-ness of MC\n- 'Cool text' is a story with OP MC without much difficulties and drama>"
