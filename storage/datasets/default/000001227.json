	"description": "In the distant past, I was cursed by my dealings with the world. \r\n\r\nOver the next 1,000 years, I lived an endless life. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t a single life I haven’t experienced. \r\n\r\nI have been the most noble and humble person in the world, I have become a beggar, I have been revered as a saint, and I have been burned as a witch. \r\n\r\nAnd after my most miserable and painful life, I thought of it all again. \r\n\r\n'It's all bothering me now—I'd like to take a break, please.\r\nI've decided to live a life of a lazy sloth this time, but why are people still bothering me? Let me get some rest.' \r\n\r\nHer story of wanting to rest! >"
