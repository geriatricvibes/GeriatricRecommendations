	"description": "For the sake of survival, I kissed the protagonist and we became partners.\r\nBut I just can’t believe that the ‘kind’ protagonist in the original novel was all an act!\r\n\r\n“If I kill you, this partner relationship will be broken.”\r\n“You can’t do that. We’ll both die at the same time.”\r\n\r\nWe were tied together by a tightly shared fate.\r\nSharing the same wounds, the same pain, the same life and death.\r\nPlus, we had to have physical contact for the symbiosis?\r\n\r\nWhen I found out about his mask, he was cruel to me with no hesitation.\r\nUnreasonable amounts of work, unreasonable demands…\r\nWhy can’t I be with another man?\r\n\r\n“I’ve figured it out! How to break this partner relationship!”\r\n\r\nNow that my life would be safe, all that’s left is to get away―\r\n\r\n“I have no intentions of breaking it.”\r\n“…pardon?”\r\n“Just like you, I’m also curious.”\r\n\r\nHe held me in his arms and his gaze slowly descended to my lips.\r\n\r\n“I’m curious about to what extent our pain will be shared.”>"
