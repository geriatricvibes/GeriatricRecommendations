	"description": "Master is a sage-like character, but is an out and out veteran rogue inside.\n\nFirst Senior Brother has the external appearance of an adorable leprechaun, but has an extremely crass and violent personality.\n\nSecond Senior Brother seems to be cultured and refined, but it can’t cover up his flirtiness and craftiness.\n\nThird Senior Sister is seductive, enchanting to the extreme, yet is actually a crude tomboy who uses brute force.\n\nFourth Senior Brother is shockingly handsome to others, but in private, he is a proud, battle-crazy glutton with a poisonous tongue.\n\nThe Zhu Zhu who looks very homely and unrefined was forced to live life among this group of beautiful people; it could be said the pressure was huge.\n\nCould it be that the heavens are doing this to project her beautiful heart?!\n\nFortunately, not only did she have a divine pig for protection, she even knows a supreme skill —— how to disguise as a pig who can devour tigers!\n\nNote: The zhu in Zhu Zhu and pig sound the same in Chinese. Same goes with the title and author's name.>"
