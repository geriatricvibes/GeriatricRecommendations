	"description": "naughty, abandoned princess Aisa. The king marries Aisa as if she had received a mine and sold it to Archduke Ainar…\r\nOn the first night, Aisa is about to confess to her husband Archduke Ainar the secret he wants to confess.\r\n\r\nHe said, “I… spent the night with another man before we got married.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOn the way to the wedding, Aisa met a man.\r\n\r\n‘If you go through a relationship with another man before marriage… … Husband, Archduke Ainar, of course, will try to annul the marriage, right?’\r\n\r\nIf the marriage really fell, then the king didn’t know if he would want to kill Aisa.\r\nBut it didn’t matter. If I could live and ruin my marriage. So, if Aisa can ruin what the King wants with her own will.\r\n\r\nEven if I die, if I achieve something, it will be better than now.\r\nRather than just being taken advantage of without meaning like now and dying.\r\nThe decision has already been made.\r\n\r\nAisa spread her arms out and hugged her man’s neck.\r\nActually, anyone was good. It didn’t matter which man. If you could ruin your marriage.\r\n\r\n“Come on, more!”\r\n\r\nBut, knowing the truth, why is her husband so affectionate? to the point of tears.\r\n\r\n>"
