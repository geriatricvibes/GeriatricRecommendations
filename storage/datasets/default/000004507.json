	"description": "In the class of Akihara Haruhito, a high school student who is good at housework, there was also a girl named Mikoto Rei.\r\n\r\nShe is the most beautiful girl in school but is also known by a peculiar nickname, the 'Ice Goddess.' Rei is what one may call a perfect superhuman. She avoids socializing with others, and Haruhito had even hardly interacted with her.\r\n\r\nOne winter day, Haruhito returns to his apartment, where he lives alone, and finds Mikoto Rei in there. Rei seems to be a distant relative of Haruhito and has come there to live in the same house with him.\r\n\r\nAt one point in time, Rei had rejected Haruhito, saying, 'I have no intention of getting along with you.'\r\n\r\nHowever, as a result of helping Rei while she was suffering from a cold, Haruhito eventually became closer to Rei.\r\n\r\nHaruhito realized that Rei, even though she appeared to be cool, was actually a really lonely person. Over the course of their lives together, Haruhito gently spoils Rei over and over, as Rei becomes too spoiled and dependent on him.>"
