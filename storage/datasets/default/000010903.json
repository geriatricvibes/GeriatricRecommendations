	"description": "Charlotte Eldomilia Amour was a picture-perfect princess. She was the ideal person who deserves all the accolades she had received, including “incredibly well-read”, “impeccably disciplined,” and “perfectly mannered.”\r\n\r\nShe is very popular among her people and has already been chosen to be the next queen, despite the fact that she has an older brother.\r\n\r\nShe herself has made every effort to fulfill this role, and her capability has already surpassed that of the current King, and everyone thought that the future of this country was secure… except for Princess Charlotte herself.\r\n\r\nPrincess Charlotte will turn 18 this year, but for some reason, she has yet to find not only a lifelong partner but a romantic partner, at that. 15 is the age of consent in this country, where royalty and nobility usually marry the same year they come of age, and even ordinary citizens marry by 18. Princess Charlotte, who has recently turned 20, was in a great panic. It is not that she had no marriage proposals at all until this age. It was just that she was hopelessly out of luck with men.\r\n\r\nEveryone around Princess Charlotte was getting married. She grew impatient and became determined to find a husband, no matter what it took! She was determined to make it happen.>"
