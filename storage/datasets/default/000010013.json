So…\n\n「We need a chief for our newly created knight squad!」 「Could you help us as our guild manager?」「We need someone to rid us of the dragon that resides in the North Mountain!!」\n\nAlfred just wanted some time to rest and recover, but no one would LEAVE HIM ALONE!\n\nBecause of that, Alfred wished to spend time recovering in a small country village that no one knew about.\n\n『Need a guard in Mulg Village. Wolves and boars attacking the village. Payment is food and board. *Village has a hot spring.』\n\n「THAT’S THE ONE!」\n\nSo, the strongest wizard in the kingdom…decided on living the slow life in the countryside.>"
