	"description": "I have a twin sister. My younger sister, Hinata, is known as the idol of the school. She’s a beautiful girl who can do everything and has a great personality. Compared to her, I can only say that I am just “ordinary”. I’m this ordinary, that even the other day, the most beautiful girl in my class tried to make fun of me by falsely confessing her love. But lately, I’ve been having strange dreams. In those dreams, my twin sister, Hinata, kissed me.>"
