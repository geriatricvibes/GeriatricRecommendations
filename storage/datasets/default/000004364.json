	"description": "“We are all like mermaids living below the sea. Around me, all that I know, is the sight of complete darkness.”\n\nLin Jing’s credo in brief–as long as it’s open, there is no PLAY that can’t begin.\n\nYet surprisingly, that strict good student who encouraged him to attend class everyday, Zhou WenYang, stirred some genuine feelings within him.\n\nIt wasn’t easy for both those boys to finally workout their “cohabitation”, but mistakes, accidents and the like were an unfortunate constant:\n\nFirst, came the witch, then soon after her a wolf stormed in, following these intrusions–somewhere quietly waiting–was the toad!\n\nOnce more apologetic and thoughtlessly fickle, Lin Jing looked towards the indifferent Wen Yang, heartbroken.\n\n… was it all truly hopeless?>"
