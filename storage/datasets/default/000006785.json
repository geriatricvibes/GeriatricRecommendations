	"description": "「If I get reincarnated, I want to be the dog of a rich household. Not having to work and having my meals handed out to me while I just sleep would be the best, wouldn’t it?」\r\n\r\nThose are the thoughts of Oogami Routa, a corporate slave who died from working too much.\r\n\r\n「I shall grant your wish!! (I’ll also give you something special as an extra!)」\r\n\r\nBecause of an enthusiastic rookie goddess, Routa truly became a rich person’s dog. He spent everyday being loved by his owner and living a pet’s life.\r\n\r\n…however\r\n\r\n「Wait, aren’t I too big for a dog? Huge fangs and a scary face, doesn’t this look more like a wolf!?」\r\n\r\nAfraid of getting exterminated for being a dangerous animal, Routa did his best to act like a cute dog.\r\n\r\nWhat Routa didn’t know was that he was no ordinary wolf, but the demon wolf king himself, Fenrir!>"
