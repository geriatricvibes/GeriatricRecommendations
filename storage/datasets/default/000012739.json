	"description": "Sylphia Harvest is a decorated Saint.\r\n\r\nShe is praying on behalf of Marianne, who is supposed to bear the title of Saint, while Marianne enjoys “making memories of her bachelorette”.\r\n\r\n(I hope it doesn’t anger the spirits…)\r\n\r\nIf a natural disaster occurred due to the wrath of the spirits, Sylphia would be executed as a false Saint. That was the rule.\r\n\r\nOne day, the spirits descend on Sylphia, who prays diligently without knowing how to pray.\r\n\r\n“The wrath of the spirit is finally upon us!? Execution?!”\r\n\r\n[Sylphia, thank you for everything. We recognize you as a true Saint and have decided to grant you power.]\r\n\r\n“Eh?!”\r\n\r\nSylphia becomes a true saint and leads the land to abundance with the help of the spirits.\r\n\r\nMarianne, on the other hand, is not satisfied with the situation, and her attempt to use the spirits inadvertently provokes their anger.>"
