	"description": "Nanshen: “Su Xiaotang, just what do you like about me? My face? My medical skills? My family background?”\n\nDesperate to prove her sincerity, the words slipped out before she could even think twice: “Of course not, that’s got nothing to do with it! I’d still like you even if you turned into a dog!”\n\nNanshen: That… sure is an unexpected way to confess…\n\nBut more unexpectedly? After a good night’s sleep, her nanshen really did become her dog.\n\n---\n‘nanshen (男神)’ is literally translated to ‘male god’, and they’re usually the tall, rich and handsome (TRH) guys you see in standard Chinese web novels, with an added status of being ‘worshipped’.>"
