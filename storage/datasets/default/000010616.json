	"description": "Before being transported into the new world, he was at the apex of gaming. Even against a thousand enemies, or tens of thousands, it would all end in a one sided massacre. He was the lone man overseeing the world at the top of his throne.\r\n\r\nAfter he was transported into the new world, the mightiest system got infused into his soul and he became the world’s strongest man.

Then who? Who was it that made this system? And who, truly stood at the top?>"
