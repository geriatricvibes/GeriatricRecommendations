	"description": "In the last battle between the Rowen kingdom and the Doubah alliance, the mad queen of the mercenary nation of Morian, Belladonna has perished.\n\nThe battle between the two powerhouses had thrown the world into chaos; countries crumbled down, people starved and rebellions started to occur. Bandits started to become commonly seen and demonic beasts could freely ravage villagers to their desire with the declined military power.\n\nThat was when mercenaries started to become an important existence to the world.\n\nOur story begins at the little town of Yark. A young little girl brought dozens of heads of wanted criminals to the mercenary association, causing uproar. This was the beginning of her journey.\n\nHer name was Bela Heiroh, a six years old little girl destined to fight in countless battles. Earning money from bounty and wars and buying slaves with it, she started building her mercenary group anew. As her name spread through the world, she dyed everywhere she passed through with blood.>"
