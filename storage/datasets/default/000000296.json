	"description": "I received my test results, where two words stuck out in devastating clarity.\r\n\r\n[No Talent]\r\n\r\nIt was something I'd already known, but it stung a little more than usual today. Was I lacking in effort or talent? Or both? Was it my fault that I was living like this, or was it society’s?\r\n\r\nIn the years since Players, Streamers, Guardians, dungeons, and monsters became a part of our everyday life, my sister died from leukemia trying to support me, and my mom passed away from a disease we couldn’t afford to treat.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep, and when I woke up the next morning to continue my futile life, I found… that I had somehow gone 10 years back in the past, to the day the world changed.\r\nWhile going through the Tutorial, I realized something.\r\n\r\nEverything’s too easy. Was I really talentless?>"
