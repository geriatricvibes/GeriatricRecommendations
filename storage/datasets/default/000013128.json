	"description": "Duchess Azu, who was perfect except for being possessed by a fox, was kept at a distance by her fiancée, the prince, because of her fox ears. \r\n\r\nThe prince, who disliked Azu, eventually became friendly with Viscount Naiya, and at the school graduation party, he foolishly announced the annulment of his engagement to the Duchess. The prince, however, did not know what his decision would lead to.\r\n\r\nEverything comes to an end when the promise made between Azu and his country is fulfilled.\r\n>"
