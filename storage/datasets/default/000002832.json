	"description": "“White Moonlight (Bai Yueguang) lies within a certain part of the heart, you are my unspeakable wound.”\r\n\r\nHaving the natural constitution of being a White Moonlight, He Ziming, after his death, got bound to the “Cannon fodder’s Counterattack System,” and thus began his journey of being reborn as all kinds of cannon fodder, helping the original owners of the body he is occupying fulfilling their wishes, face-slapping the protagonists and becoming their White Moonlight.\r\n\r\nBecause I like you, I die, but to you I am as insignificant as a bird’s feather.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still want you to remember me for your whole life, to engrave my name into your heart and soul so deeply that your heart will hurt by only thinking of me.>"
