	"description": "“Auto Memories Doll.” It’s already been a long time since that name was first popularized. It’s a machine that Dr. Orlando created that talks in a natural voice. At first, he only made it to help out his loving wife, but before long they spread out into the world. and companies were made to lend them out.\r\n\r\n“I’m Violet Evergarden, the Auto Memories Doll who will rush to provide service anywhere you wish.“\r\n\r\nThat translucent voice comes from a robotic beautiful girl with blonde hair and blue eyes like she came out of a storybook.>"
