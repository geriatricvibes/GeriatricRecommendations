	"description": "'This is your wife. She is yours. Play with her until you get bored.”\r\nMother-in-law, is that really something you should be saying to your barely 10 years old child?\r\n\r\n***\r\n​\r\nMy young husband stutters. Has a face with scales on it. Hands with scars on it. I worked hard to look after my husband who looked like that.\r\n\r\n“Keep eating. You have to eat a lot so you can be taller than me.”\r\n“Do I have to be taller than Cheria?”\r\n“…”\r\n“Well.. I- I like that Cheria is taller than me…”\r\n\r\nDid I work too hard? Where did my soft and squishy husband who used to be so fluffy go? Instead he just became a slightly insane man.\r\n\r\n“Did they die? It’s become easier now.”\r\n“…What?”\r\n“People who look at human lives like they were bugs. That’s the type of person I think is trash.”\r\n\r\nIs he watching what he does around me?>"
