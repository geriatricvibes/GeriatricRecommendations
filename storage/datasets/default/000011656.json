	"description": "In his past life, Shi Shan exhausted all his schemes only to fail to win over his love. After Wen Yang died, he was thoroughly reduced to a madman!\n\nAfter rebirth, Shi Shan has but a simple wish: make Wen Yang a winner in life.\n\nIn this lifetime, he will live for the sake of atonement.\n\nHe will conscientiously and diligently help Wen Yang chase his wife, abuse his slag father, and pave the way to the height of his career. But when he was once again backed into a corner by Wen Yang, Shi Shan began to wonder whether or not he had been too fierce!\n\nWith careful watering and sincere nurturing, it turns out the seeds of love can only flower and bear fruit in a felicitous environment…\n\nShi Shan wants to tell to his past-life self: work hard to love, be sure to stay level-headed, discard the indifferent attitude, and please don't hold on to hate.>"
