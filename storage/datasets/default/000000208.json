	"description": "Ninya only possessed one support skill, 【buff】.\r\n\r\nAs a result, she was unable to participate in the battles.\r\n\r\nThat was Ninya’s assessment within the clan.\r\n\r\nFinally, the clan decided Ninya was useless and expelled her.\r\n\r\nNinya is abandoned in the dungeon by the clan members.\r\n\r\nEveryone assumed Ninya, who couldn’t fight, would be eaten by the demons in the dungeon.\r\n\r\nAnd when Ninya herself gave up on life in the face of the demons—\r\n\r\n—○Skill 【buff】has attained level 99. Now that it has reached level 99, the skill will now evolve○—\r\n\r\nA voice from Heaven could be heard.\r\n\r\nAnd the clan that had exiled Ninya later collapsed.\r\n\r\nNobody had noticed.\r\n\r\nNinya was constantly applying a 【buff】to the entire clan.\r\n\r\nDark at first, but ultimately heartwarming.>"
