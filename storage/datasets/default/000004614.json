	"description": "If there is no “Beauty” in “The Beauty and the Beast”, then who shall lift the Beast’s curse?\r\n\r\n“One day, someone trapped in a world of black and white will appear, and stain your world with blood.”\r\n\r\nThanks to this prophecy, the “Beast”, Prince Reynsis, was abandoned and left to fend for himself. To undo the curse, he needs the “Beauty”, but the only problem is–\r\n“Who the hell is this beauty supposed to be?!”\r\n\r\nI reincarnated into my own, incomplete novel before I wrote about the beauty’s appearance! All I know about the “Beauty” is that she has black hair and crimson eyes…but after witnessing Prince Reynsis’ unfortunate childhood firsthand, I resolved to go and find the Beast’s beauty myself!>"
