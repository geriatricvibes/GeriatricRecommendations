	"description": "Two lives and two marriages. All failed.\n\nAs her third life begins, Leah makes her mind up not to marry again. But this life is strange from the beginning!\n\nJulien, a man who had been cold for a long time, turned into a sweet man. Leah makes a proposal to Julien, who is courting her passionately.\n\n“I don’t know yet whether I want to spend the rest of my life with you or not. But one thing is for sure, I want to sleep with you.”\n\nJuice dripped and his hands became sticky, but he didn’t care. The noon light came into the drawing-room in June’s middle of the day. The sun was shading his face, making it difficult to see his expression. \n\nWhite, cold hands carefully peeled off the peach skin and put it directly into my mouth. As I took a bite of the peach, his long fingers lightly touched my lips. I can’t forget that moment.\n\nLeah is getting married to a sweet, pure-hearted man, Julien. What is the secret of Julien, the perfect husband?\n\nAn endless love story that begins with a peach given by a friendly summer guest.>"
