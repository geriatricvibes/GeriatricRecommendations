O’ Dragon of Eternal Sin, the Progressive Disaster, the Forerunner, the Land of Eternal Peace, the Flames of Soul Burning, He Who Owns The Deep Soul, the Sound of Origin, the First Cause of All Things, the Principle of Circles… o’ great Negary, your servant calls for your return!\n\nWithin the darkness, someone was harmoniously chanting, he was smiling, as he knew he would finally become one with his God.\n\nAnd all of this, came from the remnant soul that was deceived to travelling to a different world and had his Protagonist Aura stolen.>"
