	"description": "He was the powerful and influential heir of B City, the merciless head of the commercial world, but the divorce papers made him lose his cool.\n\n“Sign the divorce papers, daddy,” said the 5-year-old boy.\n\nThis man had the divorce papers thrown in his face by his wife six years ago, and was now being pushed by his own son to sign the papers.\n\n“That would make you a single-parent child,” said Gu Juexi coldly.\n\n“Mommy said unicorns don’t exist but men like you do,” the boy leered at his father and said.\n\nGu Juexi’s face fell. ‘That damned woman.’\n\n“You haven’t signed the papers,” the boy reminded as the man left. As usual, the door shut in his face.\n\nGood lord… Dad and mom are not getting a divorce and are giving him a baby brother? How worrying!>"
