	"description": "Bullied and pushed off a cliff by her classmates, a girl opened her eyes together with the sound of thunderous lightning. Upon returning to the classroom, she and everyone in her class were summoned. They arrived in a world with an eerie resemblance to an online otome game that had been popular on the internet (but only the internet).\n\nNeither had they been summoned as Heroes to defeat a Dark Lord, nor would they be Saints to save the world. They were summoned to become Partners to nobilities. As the students were rooted to the spot in abject confusion, a girl walked forward to stand in front of a villainess with a smile.\n\n“I shall be in your service, milady.”\n\nThis is a story of a clumsy villainess and a maid who came from another world.\n\nFor her Mistress’ love, the maid’s work is never done.>"
