	"description": "The female protagonist looks like a hot guy, has a manly personality, and is like the dominant one in the relationship, basically the one making all the moves. Male lead (ML) is the ‘film emperor’ in the entertainment industry and has his own very successful company. \n\nThe protagonist joins the industry because initially his (ML's) manager lied to her and told her that ML’s broke with debt, so since she's currently jobless she just decides to go with the flow and start acting. Then somehow she dominates the country and she and ML become the country’s husband, who then marry and shocks the world because the public didn’t know that she's a girl and just thought she's a super hot guy.>"
