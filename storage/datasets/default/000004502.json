	"description": "Two years and two months since Rion had become a seeker delving into dungeons, he was still being made fun of by other seekers.\n\nIt was because his only ability was [Crystallisation], which he couldn’t use for anything other than creating pebbles. Normally he should have leveled up already, but it had already been two years and he was still a beginner.\n\nEvery day, he was constantly bullied and made a fool. One day, Rion fell into a massive, deep crack in the ground. It was called the Gate of Hell.\n\nThere, with fortune, he gained the special abilities [Demon Eye] and [Space-Time Manipulation], and even became able to more effectively use the ability he had from the start, [Crystallisation]. This was his awakening.>"
