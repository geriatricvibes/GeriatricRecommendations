	"description": "Minoru Kido, age 30, cause of death: traffic accident.\r\nAs a Japanese, I died without leaving any evidence of my life.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my death, I was thinking, “Next time, I want to live a long life and leave behind some proof of my life,” when I was reincarnated as an elf with a life span of 1,000 years!\r\n\r\nThat’s why I made a vow. I vowed that this time I would spend my whole life living in a way that would leave a mark on my life.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 20, I was able to use all of the healing magic that elves were originally equipped with at will.\r\n\r\nBy the age of 30, I had mastered all attribute magic, and by the age of 100, I had deciphered all the ancient magic formulas.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining 900 years of my life, all I have to do is run out of the Elven forest and become a warrior.\r\n\r\nJust to let someone know that I’m still alive.\r\n\r\nOne day, I’ll be missed by a fledgling adventurer who will eventually be called a hero.\r\nSometimes, a country is founded in my name.\r\nSometimes, I was called the founder of magic and became an object of worship.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a reincarnated elf who roars his name into history as a living legend.>"
