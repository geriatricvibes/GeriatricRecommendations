	"description": "I am an unfulfilled third year university student. Led on by my frenemy Ozu; pushed around by the preposterous demands of the mysterious, freewheeling Master Higuchi; unable to approach the beautiful, aloof maiden Akashi; I find myself far from the rosy campus life I had dreamed of. If this is how it's going to be, I had rather return to my sparkling days as a freshman and do it all over again!\r\n\r\nA rambling chronicle that sends you hurtling through four parallel realities on a bittersweet journey through youth. >"
