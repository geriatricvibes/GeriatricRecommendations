	"description": "Mahiro had been in and out of hospitals all her life due to her severe heart disease. One night, she opened her eyes as she felt the breeze blow into her room.\n\nStanding beside her bed, the youth with a hood pulled past his eyes* introduced himself as the Death God.\n\nHe said, “I have come to take your soul.”\n\nMahiro, who was told that she would die in 30 days, cheerfully asked him, “Till that day, won’t you be my conversation partner and keep me company?”\n\nMahiro had been alone in the hospital all this time. \n\nSpending time with the Death God, her life gradually became more fun.\n\nBut the fateful day was soon approaching.\n\nDay by day, her heartbeat grew weaker.\n\nHer voice turned hoarse.\n\nSeeing Mahiro like this, what the Death God did was—\n\n“Hey, Mr. Death.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t leave me.”\n\n“I won’t. I’ll be beside you till your last moments.”\n\nA bittersweet love story between a Death God and a girl waiting for her death, never fated to be.>"
