	"description": "In a world of powerful magics, the Demon Lord that instilled bottomless fear was confronted by the Heroes.\n\n\tThe Hero, together with three comrades, fought together fiercely and finally defeated the Demon Lord.\n\n\tThen, the Hero married the beautiful holy sage and lived in everlasting happiness, escorting in peaceful times…\n\n\t※\n\n\tSimilar to that fairy-tail, a girl named Estella dreamt of a sweet chance, dream-like encounter, like coffee with condensed milk and lots of sugar added (lots of milk).\n\n\tThat girl is just common folk, an average citizen that tends to dream.\n\n\tHowever, Estella had a secret that she wouldn’t tell anyone.\n\n\t「Ain’t this useless! I was tricked!」\n\n\tThat was, that she reincarnated as a villager, while retaining her past memories.\n\n\tIn addition, she spewed indecent words as her only memories were as an insignificant villager.\n\n\tToday as well, only Estella’s characteristic brightness helped her struggle through her troubles, but…\n\n\tReincarnating into this new villager, with a new start, would she be able to achieve happiness… perhaps?\n\n\t「What will my future plans become?!」\n\n\tSpeaking of which, what if villagers are the strongest? (Not possible, though)>"
