	"description": "Chu Jian and Jian Bianlin are childhood friends and grew up together almost from when they were old enough to remember. Since long ago, Jian Bianlin has loved Chu Jian, and that has not changed even now that he is a highly popular idol singer and actor. To Chu Jian, though, Jian Bianlin is just Jian Bianlin—her good, good friend, like family, but nothing more. She knows about his feelings for her and feels guilty (for various reasons which you’ll read about) about not returning those feelings. This has put a strain on their relationship over the years. Eventually, her heart softens and she gives in, promising to be his girlfriend, to give him an opportunity as well as herself a chance to open up her heart to him. And so begins our male lead’s journey of winning over the heart of the girl he has always held in his own.>"
