	"description": "After transmigrating into a novel, Shen Jiangling became the vicious male supporting character with a tragic end in a danmei novel with the classic domineering president trope. \n\nHe looked at the black card in his pocket, thought of his loving family, and stated that whoever wanted to be the vicious male supporting character can do it, he didn’t want to anymore!\n\nOn his way home after finishing the act, Sheng Jiangling picked up a dog that was in a sorry state. \n\nThe dog was particularly reserved, and it took him a lot of effort for the other party to warm up to him. \n\nUnexpectedly, when Shen Jiangling brought home a close friend’s golden retriever to temporarily look after, the reserved dog stared at the golden retriever for a long time. \n\nThen, he suddenly transformed into the villain of the novel, staring at him fiercely. \n\n“You have me, yet you still want to raise another dog?”\n\nShen Jiangling: Excuse meow? \n\nWhat godly development is this?>"
