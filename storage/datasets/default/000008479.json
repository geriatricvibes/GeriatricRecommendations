	"description": "It is rumoured that the Vice Minister of Ministry of Rites is pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this incident is this:\r\n\r\n“This day is really dull.”\r\n\r\n“Feeling bored?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a bit tedious to get through the day.”\r\n\r\n“Cong Qing, do you want children?”\r\n\r\n“If I did, would the emperor be willing?”\r\n\r\nAnd so a dark tide surged, causing an unexpected disaster, disturbing a pool of calm spring water—\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy?”\r\n\r\n“You recall, during the Autumn Hunt that one year, when you and I would meet at the prairie at night—I was already crazy for you then.”\r\n\r\nPassion is bottomless and wild; love is deep and without regrets.\r\n\r\nDon’t ask the world for everything, only seek the heart alone.\r\n\r\n#One who passed their days in boredom and so initiated a bloodbath.\r\n\r\n#Black-bellied Emperor, in the pursuit of some daily excitement, unhesitatingly jumped into a chaotic situation just to get off his feet. (no mistake)>"
