	"description": "After his rebirth, Wen Chan said, “Please don’t disturb me. I am concentrating on my revenge. “\n\nTherefore there was an uproar among the people, “Shocking news-His highness, the ninth prince, played with a hooligan in the middle of the streets.“\n\n“Did you hear that? During the Yuan festival, his highness the ninth prince made a young lady kneel for a colored lamp and threatened to smash down someone’s stall.“\n\n“I heard that the ninth prince is licentious, rude, and arrogant. He tore a young girl’s clothes in broad daylight.“\n\n“The ninth prince mocked Lord Liang for being bald…”\n\nWen Chan: “This is not the world I know.”\n\nThe people who he wanted to deliberately avoid started sticking to him.\n\nLiang Yanbei: “You tore down a young girl’s clothes? You unexpectedly have this kind of habit.“\n\nWen Chan: “What are you doing? Take your hand off my clothes.“>"
