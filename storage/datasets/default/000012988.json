	"description": "9 years and 7 months later, Qu Zhengyan finally saw Du Yongjin again.\n\nEven with a new name and surname, even no longer having the heart pounding beauty, Qu Zhengyan still recognised him at first glance. He was overwhelmed with joy. However, why did this wayward, proud and domineering young man in the past become so silent, tolerant, gentle and polite… His heart wrenched.\n\nFor Du Yongjin, He Ziming was his new life – lonely, stable, far away from the past, a peaceful life. Yet the appearance of Qu Zhengyan broke through all of these…\n\nFrom the obedient young man who constantly followed him while smiling, he became a mature man. His joy, longing, and careful touches, like a drop of water, stirred up ripples in his heart again.\n\nIn the past, there were many tales behind us. Why did we become like this? What happened back then? Life has taken us beyond our glorious youth and moving forward, can we…..still be together?>"
