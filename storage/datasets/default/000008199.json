	"description": "Hearing that her fiancé, the elegant Crown Prince, had become a paralytic, the noble girl who always wanted to outdo her peers couldn’t take the blow and killed herself, so her halpless disfigured maid had to finish the wedding ceremony with the Crown Prince on her behalf.\r\n\r\n“You are a paralyzed man, and I am an ugly girl. We are both despised by others, so we’d better stop loathing each other.” When they first met, she was all bluffing and pompous.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n“Please keep instructing me for the rest of my life.” said the once paralyzed cripple who walked slowly towards her years later while putting a phoenix coronet over her head himself.\r\n\r\n“Instruct—Instruct how?” asked the bold and naughty ugly girl who acted bashfully like a newlywed at the moment, which was rare to see on usual days.\r\n\r\n“To instruct me this way…” His face was full of tenderness, while his fingers tried to untie the lute-like buckle of her underwear slowly.>"
