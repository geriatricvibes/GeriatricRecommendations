	"description": "After dying in the line of duty, Liang Feng inexplicably transmigrated into the Western Jin Dynasty – that short-lived dynasty that succeeded the chaos of the Three Kingdoms and preceded the reign of the Sixteen Barbarian Kingdoms.\n\nTrapped in a beautiful but fragile body, would he use his looks to fake his way into being a “famous scholar?” Or would he raise an army and plant fields to fight the barbarians for dominance over the Middle Kingdom?\n\nWith a young wolfdog in tow, Liang Feng proves that he can do it all!>"
