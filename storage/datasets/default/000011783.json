	"description": "Fate, a gatekeeper who had been working for the castle, leads a troublesome life.\n\nConstant hunger attacks triggered by a power forced upon him at birth. A useless skill, it only serves to make him hungrier; however, unbeknownst to him, it has a concealed ability.\n\nOne day, having killed a thief sneaking into the castle, he finally noticed its true power.\n\nA skill that feeds upon the very soul of the subjects he kills, depriving them of all their powers. Finally, his constant hunger had been satiated for the first time.\n\nWith just that, the man who had been treated like a pile of trash slowly started raising his head. Having exceeded the concept of levels, he strikes fear with his terror-like strength, earning him the nickname…\n\nThe Glutton Berserker>"
