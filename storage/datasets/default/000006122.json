The child kept crying non-stop with his eyes swollen red, “You… are you going to sell me, hiccup.”\r\n\r\nThe man with a sullen face threw a pack of tissues to the child, and went to the balcony alone to smoke.\r\n\r\n‘How could I be so virtuous when I was a child.’\r\n\r\n*Sweet and refreshing healing story\r\n*There is a huge contrast between the character of the present male protagonist from when he was a child>"
