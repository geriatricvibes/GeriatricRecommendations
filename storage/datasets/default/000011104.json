	"description": "I transmigrated into a novel with the ending of ‘Everyone dies and the world is destroyed’. With that crazy development, this world is about to end soon... \n\nIn order to survive, I proposed to the villain who will destroy this world. \n\n“Accept the marriage and take me.” \n\nBy becoming the villain’s wife, I tried to stop the misfortune. Then after that, divorce would be enough. \n\nBut…\n\n“You must have been terrified of the demon blood flowing through my body. It’s okay, I understand.”\n\n“Yes...?!”\n\n“Still, I can’t accept this. Even if you hate me, let’s go home and do it in my arms, please?”\n\nThe thing that you’re tearing apart, is it our divorce paper?\n>"
