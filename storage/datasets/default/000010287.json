	"description": "O maple leaves as far as the eye can see, could you help me tell him, that I’m still waiting for him to come home?\r\n\r\nIn that maple forest, under that tree, it was like a dream.\r\n\r\nFollowing the gentle passing of the breeze, everything vanished into thin air as if it had never existed.\r\n\r\n“Jing’er, we’re right in the thick of autumn now. Don’t go outside too much, in case you catch a cold.”\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was just right at that time, and the maple leaves were still around. A handsome man dressed in white clothing; he’s my husband.>"
