	"description": "Storywise, this novel has initial premise for a duel between two swordsmen, Yan 13 and The Third Master of Xie Family (the title of the book is The Third Master). But then to make it a long story, the duel can't be happening at the first part. Then the sub-plots appeared and rolling continuously.\r\n\r\nIt's a good read from Gu Long, with his distinctive writing style. There're lots of betraying and plot twists in such a short novel, sometimes resulting in confusion for readers. The Third young master is a good character, with his personalities unravel mostly through other characters.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the duel was inevitable. The surprise at the end of duel was made this wuxia story uncommon.>"
