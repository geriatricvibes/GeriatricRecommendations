	"description": "In a certain place, there was a traveler witch. Her name was Elaina.\n\nBeing a traveler, she came across many people and countries while continuing her long, long journey.\n\nA country that only accepted magicians, a muscle loving giant, a youth at death’s door awaiting his lover’s return, a Princess left alone in the ruined country, and the story of the witch herself up until now and from now on.\n\nWhile meeting particularly peculiar people and experiencing others’ moments of beauty, even now, the witch keeps spinning the tale of meeting and parting evermore.\n\n“Please don’t mind it. After all, I’m a traveler. I must hurry ahead.”\n\nThe Witch――Yes, me.>"
