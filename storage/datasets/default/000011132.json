	"description": "One is a blind girl, the embodiment of an orchid, intelligent with sophisticated grace, and the other, a young noble who loved his wealth as if it were his life.\n\nHis endless teasing, and her numerous counter-attacks,\nShe planned every advance with detail, and he met her with each step,\nAs he excitedly went about making life difficult for her, all she did was sigh at his childishness.\n\nThe uneasy-proud-young noble’s odd actions, contrasted against the calm plotting of an unfazed blind girl.\n\n*Haih, one should never invite the attentions of a petty man…*\n\nThe two were at loggerheads from the very beginning, and to no one’s surprise, they soon saw each other as the enemy, and neither tried to understand the other’s position.\n\nAnd thus it came to this,\nas long as the Young Lady did not give in, then the Young Sir would not leave her in peace.\n\nA blind girl thrice married, but to the same person every time.\n\nThrice wedded, thrice wedded to;\n\nBut together forever after.>"
