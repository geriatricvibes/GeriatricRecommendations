	"description": "Ye Tian crossed through Ancient Rome with the Strongest Slaveholder System.\n\nHe kicked Crassus’s ass, smacked Pompey’s face, and stroked Caesar’s head.\n\nWith the backing of the Senate, and the three giants of Rome bowing their heads, those proud aristocrats knelt at Ye TIan’s feet.\n\nArcheological experts of later ages found that, unexpectedly, the Supreme Emperor who had once ruled three continents…was a chinese man.>"
