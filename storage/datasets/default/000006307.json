	"description": "Others usually appeared as human when they possessed a character in a book, but I possessed a doll.\n\nIt was also a favorite doll of the tyrant whose neck went flying because of the male lead.\n\n‘I’ve already died once, but I don’t want to die again!’\n\nTo survive, I must edify the tyrant.\n\nTo do that, I must first move my body… What? Oh, it’s moving?\n\n“Are you really Chloe? No, who are you?”\n\nA young emperor of the Burgundy Empire and a tyrant with the end faith of dying. Reclaim my body while edifying him!\n\n***\n\nThe hair was not black.\n\nInstead, it was shiny gold. It was the same color as the doll.\n\nStanding still, panicked, Declan asked again in a trembling voice.\n\n“…Chloe, are you really here? But why do you look like a doll?”\n\nFrom the time the doll moved its hand, he had an expectation that Chloe might have been in it.\n\nIn such a situation, although it looks translucent, there is a person who looks exactly like a doll, so it is worth expecting that it was Chloe.\n\nBecause in the end, people just believe whatever they want to believe.\n\n“I am not the princess.”\n\nHis eyes greatly shook at the firm answer.>"
