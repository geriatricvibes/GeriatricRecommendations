Even after her death, her demonic eyes continue to haunt people, and rumors of a “curse” that she is said to have left behind are falsely spread within the academy. Sasuga Itami, a girl who can see a hallucination of Shinzoukon, tries to unravel the mystery of the “curse” and get to the bottom of her death.>"
