	"description": "Su Xiaoying saw Su Mu and a certain president’s intimate photos. So he called the president father.\n\nSu Mu was scared that his heart and liver trembled, and he quickly hugged his son.\n\nSu Mu: “Don’t call him dad.”\n\nThe president pinched his little face. “If you don’t let him call me, then you call me.”\n\nIn the evening, Su Mu called the president Dad more than a 100 times. His tired lips quivering…\n\nThe president asked after the incident: “Tell me, when did you steal me a son?”\n\nSu Mu shrinks his neck. “I didn’t. I gave birth to him.”\n\nPresident: “I don’t remember having anyone else but you.”\n\nSu Mu instantly sheds tears: “Dad, we are all your good sons.”>"
