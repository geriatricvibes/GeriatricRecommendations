	"description": "The vastly differing world views of the male and female lead –\n\nThe purpose of food:\n\nFemale lead: To fill my tummy!\n\nMale lead: Art!\n\nThe impression they have of each other:\n\nFemale lead: Impossible!\n\nMale lead: Too s*upid!\n\nIs there a possibility that you would date the other party?\n\nFemale lead: Who, who wants to get together with this peculiar weirdo!\n\nMale lead: She’s so s*upid, I’m the only person capable of accepting her.\n\nThis is a story about how an arrogant and cold male idol successfully PKs the female lead’s black-bellied childhood playmate before bringing the female lead along in his domination over the world of gourmet food. The male lead is an extremely talented chef; however, he suffers from blindness – thus, his other senses are all hypersensitive with the exception of his sight. With his perfect sense of taste and his ability to accurately determine people’s attitude and feelings through their vocal tone and their breathing, he is better able to discern the truth and people’s real underlying intentions when compared to the common man.>"
