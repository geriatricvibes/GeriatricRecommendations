	"description": "The simple and pure System: Host, who are you?\n\nQuan Nai: I am just a big weakling.\n\nSystem: We’re letting you go to purify villains, not take advantage of it!\n\nThe villain smiled dotingly.\n\nThat year under a fully blooming moon, the villain smiled with a scalpel in hand, “How about always staying beside me?”\n\nIt was also peaceful that year, the villain threw over a marriage certificate, “The emperor bestowed you a marriage, do you dare not marry?”\n\nOr that calm year, the villain packaged himself up, “Master, you promised, you would keep anything that disciple gave you.”\n\nSystem: Both the heroine and the hero have the protagonist aura, how come it doesn’t work on the host??\n\nMany years later.\n\nThe no longer simple and pure System: Host, who are you really?\n\nQuan Nai: I’m just a weakling.\n\nThe male lead is a refined and gentle failure, the female lead is mysterious and unstable (thinks bipolar).>"
