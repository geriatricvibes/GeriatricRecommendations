	"description": "When he woke up from sleep, Ruan Shiqing, a weapon R&D engineer, became a wanderer on Junk Star.\n\nStart with a cub, and the equipment depends on picking up.\n\nRuan Shiqing: …. OK.\n\nRaising cubs is not easy, Ruan Shiqing picked up his old business and devoted himself to the great cause of garbage recycling and turning waste into treasure.\n\nOn the junk star B3024, a repair shop hidden in the corner is famous among the stars. It is said that as long as the starting price is given, there is no weapon that the shopkeeper cannot make.\n\nThe owner, Ruan Shiqing, who never could afford food and brought five cubs with him, became the richest man on the Interstellar Black List.\n\nHe packed up his luggage and carried the cubs into the spaceship cabin one by one, preparing to take the cubs to the capital star to see the world.\n\nHowever, just after leaving the port, looking at the wanted notices posted everywhere, a question mark slowly appeared above Ruan Shiqing’s head: ?\n\nHow come the five interstellar pirates on this wanted list look like the cubs in his arms?\n\n…things started to go wrong.​​\n\nOn the eve of the succession ceremony, Rong Heng was attacked, and his aircraft crashed on Junk Star B3024. He was seriously injured and nearly died, returning to the most humiliating childhood.\n\nThe infancy of the Yomir family: white fur, brown eyes, no horns, weak like a puppy.\n\nIn a desperate situation full of resentment, he picked him up from the dirty garbage heap with both hands, and said softly, “Whose puppy is it? Come home with me if no one wants it.”\n\nIf Rong Heng was able to, he would bite his wrist fiercely and tell him that the Yomir family was the most ancient and noble race in the entire universe.\n\nBut later, he became the emperor of the empire, but he was still willing to stay by his side in the weakest form, disguised as a little cub, just to monopolize the favor of the youth.>"
