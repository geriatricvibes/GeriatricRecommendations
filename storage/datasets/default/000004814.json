	"description": "Sometimes, your environment could change overnight without having to experience regression, transmigration, or even reincarnation.\n\nIt was when your mother fell in love with the Duke of the Empire.\n\nThat’s why I have a new brother.\n\nBut he’s a little weird. \n\n“I promise you I will look after you, so you won’t get even a drop of water on your hand until the day I die.”\n\n“Why do you promise me that?”\n\n“I prepared this for you.”\n\n“I hate wasting.”\n\n“Feel free to let me know if there’s anything you want.”\n\n“Please don’t stay at home, meet your friends outside and socialize.”\n\nReally, why is my brother like this to me?\n\nEven today, this little sister is worn out.>"
