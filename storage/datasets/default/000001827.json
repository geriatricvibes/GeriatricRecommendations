	"description": "The world is like a chessboard.\n\n“I do not want to be treated as a chess piece by the players!”\n\nDefeat in this chess is tantamount to the destruction of my body and I’ll thoroughly disappear! Victory in this chess and I’ll have a very long life!\n\nWith the help of an ancient Weiqi piece, Gu Hai arrived at the Divine Province Mainland!\n\nHeavenly Dao is eternal, however life is limited, making heaven and earth pieces of a chessboard, then in the end transformed into a loess, vanishing like faded smoke and scattered clouds. Nevertheless people still jump out of the chessboard, and these people are already prepared for their death while playing chess against the heavens, and perhaps win eternal life for themselves?\n\n“I’ve come, and I want to live through 10,000 lives without any boundaries!”>"
