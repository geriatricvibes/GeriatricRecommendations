	"description": "“You, that’s His Majesty the Emperor, you know!?”\n\n“Is that more important than a steamed bun?”\n\nYui Mei has two secrets.\n\nFirst, she retained the memories of her past life. Second, it is highly probable that she is a daughter of the Sai Kingdom’s Emperor.\n\nAs a certified die-hard fan of Chinese dramas in her past life, she willingly participated in the court lady selection just for the sake of seeing the imperial harem in the flesh.>"
