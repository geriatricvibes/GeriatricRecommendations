	"description": "Hinako Konohana is a true young lady.\r\n\r\nHer family's Konohana Group is a conglomerate with total assets of 300 trillion yen. She attends one of the most prestigious schools in Japan, and her talent and beauty are completely out of reach for me, an ordinary citizen.\r\n\r\nBut then, one day. I find out who she really is. On the surface, Hinako Konohana is a perfect young lady, but in reality, she is a girl with no life skills or common sense.\r\n\r\nBy chance, I end up taking care of this young lady for a while, and before I know it, she's taken a liking to me―.\r\n\r\n'I want this person.'\r\n\r\nAccording to the words from the top ― whoop, I was kidnapped by the Konohana family and became a live-in employee. In addition, I ended up attending the same prestigious school as the young lady's caretaker.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a commoner who feels constrained at a prestigious school where the children of the rich and powerful attend. As the caretaker, my mission is to protect Hinako Konohana's reputation as the 'perfect young lady' until she graduates.>"
