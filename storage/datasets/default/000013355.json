	"description": "In his previous life, Mu Xiyun was a famous immortal, the first disciple of Moyun Mountain, and the hero of the battle between immortals and demons.\r\n\r\nBut in the battle with the traitor Gu Qingqiao, he sacrificed himself and died.\r\n\r\nEveryone said that Gu Qingqiao was the lowest half-blood demon and the enemy who killed his master.\r\n\r\nThe two hated each other, but he had always longed to meet Gu Qingqiao again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years later, Mu Xiyun was reborn.\r\n\r\nHe studied cultivation again, left the mountain afterwards and became involved in a suspicious case.\r\n\r\nOn the way, he met a mysterious man who was pursuing the same case as him.\r\n\r\nSince then, the man never left his side.\r\n\r\nGu Qingqiao: 'Ah Yun, I was wronged.'\r\n\r\nMu Xiyun: 'I know. I’ll help you get revenge?'\r\n\r\nWhen the people who despised him and tortured him knew the truth:\r\n\r\nImmortal sect: 'Please save the three realms for the common people in the world!'\r\n\r\nGu Qingqiao: 'I won't go!'\r\n\r\nMu Xiyun: 'Qingqiao, I can't bear the suffering of the common people!'\r\n\r\nGuqingqiao: 'Let me help!'\r\n>"
