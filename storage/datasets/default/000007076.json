	"description": "'Alicia Filta, I break my engagement with you!'\r\n\r\nsaid Raymond-sama, the son of the Duke of Jaeger. On Raymond-sama's arm was Miranda-sama, the Baroness' daughter. Miranda-sama was a pretty, sheltered girl with pink downy hair, big red eyes, and a petite stature.\r\n\r\nI, on the other hand, have silver hair and violet eyes, and my facial expression is not as expressive, which is why I am called the 'Princess of Noh Masks' or 'the Doll Princess.'\r\n\r\nNo wonder Raymond-sama is attracted to Miranda-sama.... But...\r\n\r\n'You're jealous of my fondness for the kind-hearted and beautiful Miranda, and you've torn up Miranda's school books, pushed her down the stairs, and committed other violent acts!'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me?! Can I talk to you for a minute?'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\nRaymond-sama frowns and stares at me.\r\n\r\n'You're breaking off your engagement with me? It was done yesterday, didn't you know?!'\r\n\r\nAt my words, Raymond-sama and Miranda-sama looked at each other in shock.\r\n>"
