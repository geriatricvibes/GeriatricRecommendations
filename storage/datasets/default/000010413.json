	"description": "I have been in this strange land for too long. Now the memories of my hometown have faded, only to be replaced with useless memories.\r\nThis damn world was once a game. I don’t know if the game became a reality or if I was just pretending this world to be a game, but it’s either one of that.\r\n\r\nIn the game that became reality, no one could believe it,\r\nIn order to survive, I had no choice but to become a miscellaneous character.\r\n\r\nAs the water got colder, Ivan’s mood also got colder.\r\nThat day, Ivan used the cost of one robber’s life for lodging and bathing.>"
