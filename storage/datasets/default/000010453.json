	"description": "Albarino was a forensic pathologist at Westland Forensic Bureau, single, witty, and would go out for a drink with his colleagues – just like any other forensic pathologist.\n\nExcept for one thing: he was secretly a psycho serial killer.\n\nFor the longest time, Albarino had a normal 3-point-1-line life* from home – Forensic Bureau – crime scene (his own or someone else’s), until one day, another psycho serial killer unintentionally killed his target he had planned to kill for 3 months.\n\nWith all his meticulous planning ruined, he was pissed off, so he decided to provoke the other serial killer himself.\n\n*a boring, monotone, unchanging life.>"
