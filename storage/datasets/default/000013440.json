	"description": "While forever-No.2 Yao Yi was submitting her homework, she overhead some teachers casually gossiping in the staffroom, about how a student’s academic performance had worsened significantly ever since he started dating.\r\n\r\nYao Yi’s eyes lit up when she heard this, then and there she made up her mind to go approach the form’s No.1 student, date him, and then let him drop rock-bottom in terms of academic performance! This way, she could be the number 1 student in the form.\r\n\r\nMuch later, still-forever-Number 2 Yao Yi: If I can’t rank first in the form, then I’ll settle for being their person instead>"
