	"description": "Theresia Oblene, eight years old.\r\nAs her dead mother's things which she left were taken hostage, she was threatened by her wicked biological father and was made to go to be adopted by the Ghost Duke family.\r\n\r\n'But he surely only told me to go to be adopted, right. He didn't tell me not to get a dissolution of adoption, did he?'\r\n\r\nNow that it has become like this, I'll leave my name as the fastest child to get a dissolution of adoption in the history of the Empire.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAn heir's duty? What's that? Is it something to be eaten?\r\nIt was my plan to become a lout and be kicked out on purpose.\r\nUntil I met the Ghost Duke who got cursed.\r\n\r\n[Let me do this kind of thing as a parent, Terry.]\r\n[I will become the Miss' wooden horse!]\r\n[Thank you, Miss!]\r\n\r\nThe Duke is too kind, and the employees are too sweet. \r\nIf so... change of plan!\r\nI decided to raise the Duke Family which is going doom, and buy the whole Viscount family.\r\nShouldn’t I use the ability to see ghosts at times like this?\r\nBut…\r\n\r\n[Hey, you. If you keep pretending not to know...]\r\n[I will tell the ghosts of the mansion that you can see ghosts.]\r\n\r\nMy ability got caught by some teddy bear that was possessed by a ghost.\r\nWill… I be able to survive here safely?\r\n\r\n>"
