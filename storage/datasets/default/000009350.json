	"description": "A young orphaned boy named Mu Yi is saved by an old travelling Taoist Priest. They travel the world ‘scamming’ people by ‘exorcising ghosts’ and ‘slaying demons’, that is until the old Taoist Priest dies and Mu Yi is forced to realise that all is not as it seems. He was told stories of armies of ghosts, hordes of zombies, horrifying demons, and worst of all, the cultivators who controlled them.\n\nMu Yi takes his first steps towards rising to the top of this dark and cruel new world.>"
