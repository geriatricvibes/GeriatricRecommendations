	"description": "Her fiancé eloped with the saint. Thus, a new fiancé was presented to Claudia Rosenheim. The new fiancé is the so-called「Wolf Prince」, Isaak Lambertz.\n\nThe Wolf Prince had a sharp tongue, was ill-tempered, and was not gentle at all. For as long as they had known each other, they had only quarreled at each meeting.\n\nWith a relationship where they fought like dogs and monkeys*, I wonder if they’ll ever get along?\n\n……However, he, who became the fiancé, is now slightly different. Perhaps, he is willing to be kind?\n\nHuh. This seems like it’ll be good.\n\nA new love story beginning with a broken engagement.\n\n *In Japan, dogs and monkeys are often portrayed as two species that just can’t get along like cats and dogs in western cultures.>"
