	"description": "I was reincarnated into a horrifying world. That is… the world of the otome game “I’ll Risk Everything for You”.\n\nIn that world I was reincarnated as the hidden love interest character, and decided to never involve myself with the Heroine. My head gets all screwed up whenever I’m around them.\n\nThis is a love story of the main character who reincarnated into a love interest and the young woman who served as the villain.>"
