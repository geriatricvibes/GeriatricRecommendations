	"description": "By the powers of the Silver Dragon, I was swept into the novel The Hero's Birth as Roselle, the maiden who guarded the Holy Sword. It was then that I met the hero Noark Arthur Blaze and we were eventually wed... but I had never opened my heart to him. I never believed that he truly loved me for me and not because I was the 'heroine' of the novel. Then one day, he died without ever knowing my real feelings for him.\r\n\r\nThis time... this time I will make things right. For the man I loved, I will use the wish the Silver Dragon granted me to take me back to the time we first met. My love, I will make you the happiest hero in the world so stop avoiding me please!>"
