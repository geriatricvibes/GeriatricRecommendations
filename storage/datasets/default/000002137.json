Initially, he wanted to spend his days lazing about. What? The first place in the year gets a generous scholarship? Then staying up to study and train my body is nothing at all! The first place scholarship is definitely mine!\r\n\r\nThe A in the opposite dorm: So you're actually an O.\r\n\r\nNing An: Ah?\r\n\r\nThe A in the opposite dorm: I know.

Laozi is a B.\r\n\r\nThe A in the opposite dorm: You need to correctly recognise your own gender ah.\r\n\r\nNing An: .... Teacher. Report. I'm afraid this person is stupid.\r\n\r\nnote: Pretending to be a B' is 装B (Zhuang B). 装B also means to boast or show off>"
