Then one day, Kim Sukyung, a country bumpkin, appears in his office. He has never seen such an unfashionable woman in his life. \n\nAs her consultant, Sungwoo decides to transform Sukyung into a modern woman. He works to change both her appearance and her old-fashioned ideas. \n\nKim Sukyung is a naive girl who has lived all her life for her step brother Jaewon, who isn’t biologically related. She has been in love with him for a long time, but when she realizes Jaewon feels embarrassed by her appearance, Skyung decides to transform herself. \n\nHere in this novel, a woman is reborn into a whole new person.
