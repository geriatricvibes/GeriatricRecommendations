	"description": "She believed he was a heartless husband and treated him badly.\r\n\r\nUntil he was hunted down as a traitor in order to protect her.\r\n\r\n‘My wife. Please be in good health.’\r\n\r\nMy heart was torn to pieces as I knelt before his severed arm.\r\n\r\nEven now. But this time I could see that his body was clearly intact.\r\n\r\n“Princess? Why are you crying all of a sudden?”\r\n\r\nShe had returned after losing hope. To the first night of their wedding three years ago.\r\n\r\n“You must be nervous about your first night. Don’t worry. I didn’t plan to spend the night with the princess anyways.”\r\n\r\n“Why? I’m your bride and the wedding is over. Now, let’s take off our clothes and go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“…Princess?”\r\n\r\nI tugged at his arm with force.\r\n\r\nI’m not leaving you this time. I will protect you for sure, and I’ll die with you if I fail to do so.\r\n\r\nNot as Nirisu’s princess but your wife, Agnes Arpad.\r\n\r\nShe pledged with determination.>"
