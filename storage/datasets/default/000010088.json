	"description": "Charlotte, who was reincarnated as a villainess girl in an otome game, attempts to avoid the death flags (as any transmigrated villainess does). The goal is to spread the liquor that she loves all throughout this world! However, the juices and holy water that she makes for trial are all nonstandard…\r\n\r\nIncludes the common fun fantasy tropes, family/friends, adventure, dungeons and monsters, beastmen, and lots of baking/alcohol. A happy-go-lucky cheat isekai through and through.>"
