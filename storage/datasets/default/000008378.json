	"description": "One day, a typical high school boy, Kusuki Shiromu, was suddenly transported into another world.\n\n“It can’t be helped that I transported, right? Yahooー! It’s the world I have always yearned for! All right, let’s create a harem!” Is what I thought but something feels wrong. The guild receptionist isn’t a girl and I haven’t seen any girls at all. Hmm? What happened to my dream of getting a beautiful cat-eared s*x s*ave? It seems that only males exist in this world. Ehh?! Change!!!>"
