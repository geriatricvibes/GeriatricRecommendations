	"description": "The villain is an essential novel character that needs to be filled in. As a high-class villain club’s heir, Xia Bei Bei is determined to have her name go down in history as a byword for infamy villainess. However, to forge ahead towards the brilliant prospect as a true villainess BOSS, inevitably there will be a figure who appears in front of her from time to time who wanted to push her to her death due to some twisted rule.\r\n\r\nXia Bei Bei: Male God, what are you doing right now?\r\n\r\nSuch-and-such Male God: I know that you have been coveting my beauty for a long time. So this time, I’ll reluctantly allow you to be intimate with me. Darling, you can’t backpedal. I’ll let you kiss me.\r\n\r\nXia Bei Bei: Cough* Cough* Male God, don’t give up on your treatment!>"
