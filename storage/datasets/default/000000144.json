	"description": "When Han Jing, a hitwoman with special abilities, transformed into the nasty and arrogant Lady Han, she used her privilege to be domineering to the max!! \r\n\r\nHer fiancé despised her and provoked her repeatedly so she broke off the engagement! \r\n\r\nShe then got married to her fiancé’s uncle while pregnant so she could mock her fiancé and make him call her 'aunt'! \r\n\r\nSince she died in her lifetime because she fell into someone’s trap, she would allow no one to change her destiny anymore, not even god! She would destroy anyone who attempted to tear her down! She would put everyone under her heel and live according to her wishes! \r\n\r\nHowever, can anyone please tell her whose baby is in her belly?! \r\n\r\n>"
