	"description": "I somehow took over the body of a villainess in a novel.\n\nOriginally, I was supposed to die after coveting the male lead, but instead, I decided to become a rich unemployed woman and enjoy a life full of pleasures.\n\n“You said you wanted to raise a puppy, so this brother went to hunt one for you. How’s your brother’s hunting skills?”\n\nUntil my brother came back after hunting the male lead who had turned into a wolf…\n\n* * *\n\nHaving been forced to look after the male lead, I somehow succeeded in taming him after many twists and turns.\n\nNow all that’s left is to look for this mysterious female lead and hand over the leash, then it will be all over.\n\nBut…\n\n“Have you become tired of me ?”\n\n“No, not at all.”\n\n“Then why do you keep trying to send me to a strange person?”\n\nMaybe it’s because he has stayed with me for too long, but it seems he has lost his sociability/social skills and has also developed separation anxiety.\n\n“That person is someone very important to Your Highness.”\n\n“The only person that is important to me is you.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“Yes, because I’ve imprinted,” he whispered and crinkled/curved the corner of his eyes. “On you.”\n\nThe half-bent, bright yellow eyes were brimming with obsession.>"
