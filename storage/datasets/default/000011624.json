But then, monsters suddenly appeared out of thin air. With his highly trained skills that he has gained from his previous occupation, he starts to hunt the monsters down and manages to win, saving countless people who were also in the mall.\n\nBut there are more, and they don't stop coming.\n\nWould he be able to survive till the end?\n\nWould he be able to beat the countless amount of monsters that only seem to get stronger?\n\nAnd would it just be monsters that he has to worry about?\n\n This is the story of Kim Tae-Hoon, one of the first hunters to rise during an era when monsters first started to appear.>"
