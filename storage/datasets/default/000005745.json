	"description": "11-year-old Jung Si-woo always had to play alone during PE class.\n\n“I’m excluded from any ball games.”\n\n“Are you kidding me? Why are you the only exception?”\n\n“If I play with the rest, everyone will be excluded. Physically.”\n\nThe strength that Jung Si-woo has is not from any hard training but just a power he was born with.\n\nWhen he turns 16 years old, the world faced a cataclysm, a huge castle appeared over the Earth out of nowhere. It began selecting special humans to grant them wings making them a Player and that soon changed the world.\n\n10 years passed.\n\nJung Si-woo with a supernatural strength has still not been able to forsake his dream to be a Player. While he was enjoying his jobless life, he saved a falling Player and unknowingly met the requirement to be a ‘Underground Player’.\n\nHe became more special than anyone ever is! Now, Jung Si-woo brilliant dungeon strategy play begins.>"
