	"description": "My name is Wang Shou Ning and I’m 26 years old this year. Maybe some day in the future you will pass by me on the street, but you have forgotten my name; if that is the case then you can call me a passerby {stranger}.\r\n\r\nWhen you pass by me you might see a handsome man walking right next to me. You will not need to wonder or doubt because yes, he is actually with me; he is my boyfriend.>"
