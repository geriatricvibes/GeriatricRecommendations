	"description": "The journey of a generation’s male empress started because of four words.\n\n“Send a dowry escort.”\n\nDuring the 19th year of the Yuanqing Era, Qi Yunruo boarded a carriage and entered through a corner door of the second prince’s estate. Then, across the watery corridor, he gazed at the prince from afar.\n\n———\n\nThe promotional record of a young teen married off as part of his legitimate sister’s dowry.\n\nFrom two people who never met before to two people who could understand each other’s thoughts by just a glance.\n\nThere’s a type of happiness sparked when the most suitable people meet in the most suitable place.\n\nNotes:\nIn order for aristocratic women in imperial China to marry into a family part of the upper nobility, they must be of the legitimate line and must also have a dowry escort that married into that family. That escort would be a “ying” (媵) and could be considered a concubine.>"
