	"description": "I am Daisy von Preslaria. Even though I was born in a viscount family that produces excellent magicians, I was the only one in my family that was granted the failure job, Alchemist.\n\nSince this has happened, let’s try studying hard and become independent as a worthy alchemist!\n\nThe five-year-old girl resolved and began to make potions by trial and error. Thanks to her Appraisal skill that she secretly possessed, let alone misfortune, the finished product was of high-quality never seen anywhere!\n\nShe cultivated medicinal herbs, indulged herself in research, went harvesting, and opened a store.\n\nThis is a story of an alchemist living carefreely, sometimes fervently, while being helped by various people (by non-humans too).>"
