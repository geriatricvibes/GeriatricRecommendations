Fall in love.\n\nYan Liang: The name is in the shape of loving you. ¹\n\nShi An: …Afraid of the sun.²\n\nI think.\n\nYou’ve probably learned the magic of warming hearts .\n\nNotes:\n1. ….是爱你的形状 (… is in the shape of loving you) is a meme. It’s basically Yan Liang confessing his love for Shi An\n2. This is a word play on his name. Yan Liang’s Yan consists of 日 on top of 安, and Shi An’s An is also (安). Basically, Shi An adds 日 on his 安 so he feels very hot because the sun is on top of him, so that’s why he says he’s afraid of the sun.>"
