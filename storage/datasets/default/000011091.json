	"description": "Lee Mo Yan, known as 'Lee', an elite of the legal world who is approaching his forties, had worked hard to pave the way to get to where he was. However, all that he worked for vanished into thin air when a political scandal broke out involving a politician he backed and when his lover dumped him. Finding himself in a worrisome situation, Lee received an unexpected invitation from an upperclassman from his past.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to T City to become an office worker after living in Los Angeles, he encountered Ke Luo, the boy who had left him without saying farewell. Pretending it was nothing, he continued to live frivolously. That is, until he fell apart after realizing that he was a substitute for someone else… \r\n\r\nCould this sadness be love arriving a little too late?>"
