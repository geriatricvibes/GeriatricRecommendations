	"description": "It was right after I entered high school—\r\nI, Ayano Muguchi, saw the boy I've always had a crush on, Naruse Narumi, fall in love for the first time.\r\nAs soon as I was depressed, Narumi asked me to support him in his love ......, but I thought this was my chance.\r\nI decided to take advantage of my position as an advisor to close the distance between me and Narumi-senpai and aim for a side love affair.\r\nMy way of doing things may be cunning. But I can't pretend to be something I'm not if I want to be with the person I love.\r\nI'll make him fall in love with me before Narumi's first love comes true.>"
