	"description": "Reina Kamisu is a friend of loners, a slayer of families, a savior of worlds, and a killer of lovers—and she is absurdly beautiful. Who is she and what are her intentions? The search for her true identity begins with Fumi Saito, a lonely girl student whose only friend and support in life is Reina, as she is accused of things she did not do…\n\n\nThis is a story of delusions, despair and destructive beauty.\n\nThe series consists of two volumes titled “Kamisu Reina wa Koko ni Iru” (Kamisu Reina Is Here) and “Kamisu Reina wa Koko ni Chiru” (Kamisu Reina Disperses Here).>"
