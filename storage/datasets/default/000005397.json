	"description": "'Time spent with cats is never wasted.'\n\nKuze found a cat.\n\nIt was a dirty stray cat, with tangled hairs and hard lumps that couldn’t be seen clearly whether it was mud or blood scabs. Just after a sharp bend in the mountain road, he saw it lying on its side, half buried in the snow near the side of the cliff.>"
