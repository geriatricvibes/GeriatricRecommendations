	"description": "I have five older sisters. One is a saint who gathers faith, one is a female knight of Ikkitousen, one is a sage seeking truth, one is a wizard who shakes people’s souls, and one is a great merchant who moves the country. Their wisdom and good looks were loved by everyone, but their true nature, which only I could see, was the worst. As an incompetent younger brother, I’ve been receiving abusive words from my sisters every day. But one day, I finally reached the limit of my patience.\n\n“Anyway, I’ll leave this house. I’ve already decided.”\n\nThus, I left the house and became an adventurer in a remote city. In this way as I started my new life, I started noticing. Huh? Am I by any chance, ultra-competent …! ? Evaluated for my ability, I continue to succeed rapidly.>"
