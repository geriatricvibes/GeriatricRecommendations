	"description": "One day, when Xiao Tang read a semi-autobiographical book that smeared his male god's name, Xiao Tang angrily threw the book and ended up passing through.\n\nA book separates the two worlds, on one side is the 5G era, and on the other side is inside the book named “Thank you, for your love in 1999.”\n\nTang Jinyu, a 17-year-old high school student, has shrunk to a small toddler. He tries to step on a small stepping stool to see the world outside his front door, but he ends up seeing his male god carrying a schoolbag passing by…\n\nHe lives next door to his male god =口=! !>"
