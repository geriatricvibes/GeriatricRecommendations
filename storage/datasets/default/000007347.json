	"description": "Living for the sole aim of escaping!\n\n‘Light of Rusbella’ was a depressing romance novel.\n\nWishing for a new life, Asili Rosé was reborn as the daughter of the 8th wife of the Estrian Emperor.\n\nShe thought she was born with a golden spoon, but it was actually just a gilded spoon?\n\nOnce she realized that nothing but ruin awaited, she found a diary foreshadowing the future…\n\nIt foretold Asili’s death by the hands of the Crown Prince, Castor!\n\n[“What does the empire mean to you?” After asking this, the Crown Prince smiled so very beautifully. And then he killed me.]\nUnfortunately, Asili kept coming back to life, and continued to be killed over and over again. As she continued to relive her deaths, she slowly lost her smile and changed.\n\n…Let’s try to survive first.\n\n__\n\n“What can I do for my elder brother?”\n\n“Well.”\n\n__\n\nPale sky blue hair fluttered finely in the wind. He smiled weakly, before parting his dry lips.\n\n“Call my name.”\n\n“…”\n\nMy head quickly snapped up.\n\n“Call me… Amor.”\n\nHis fingertips skimmed along my inner wrist.>"
