	"description": "In the rural northeastern mountainous regions stands a tiny Buddhist temple, named One Finger Temple. It isn’t a large one but it is extremely miraculous.\n\nThe temple has rice that emanates an aromatic fragrance.\n\nThe temple has sweet and refreshing water that rivals ambrosia.\n\nThe temple has Buddhas that grant wishes to the sincere.\n\nThe temple isn’t large but it has everything. The temple isn’t large but it has flourishing incense offerings that far exceed all temples. The temple isn’t large but it attracts both citizens and foreigners that line up overnight…\n\nThe temple has a bald but handsome monk. Every day, he would bawl, “I want to renounce asceticism! I want to marry a chick that’s not too pretty, have a cute baby, and lead a stable life!”>"
