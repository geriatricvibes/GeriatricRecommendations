	"description": "She died in her prime as the Queen of Song.\r\n\r\nAfter being reincarnated, she becomes a simple trainee.\r\n\r\nLosing her former glory? It doesn't matter—no one can compete with her voice as a beautiful singer.\r\n\r\nMocked by her lowly birth? It doesn't matter—her true identity is enough to make the whole world tremble.\r\n\r\nShe owes huge debts? It doesn't matter...\r\n\r\nA powerful boss once whispered to her, 'Your debt will disappear if you become my woman.'\r\n\r\nBut the proud her would reply, 'I'm sorry. I would sell my art, but not myself.'>"
