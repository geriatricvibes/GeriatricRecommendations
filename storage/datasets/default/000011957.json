	"description": "Scyllia is a noble Paladin of the Western Continent.\n\nWhile subjugating the smuggled monsters, she felt the unusual energy of a monster fox , so she found a priestess of the Eastern continent to ask about it.\n\n\n“It’s a terrifying nine-tailed-fox. If you don’t want to see it become a demon of hell raise it yourself and bring it to the East Continent.” \n\n\nSo she raised and taught the fox with effort…\n\n\n“I am of a race greater than that of a beast. Scyllia knows that, right?”\n\n“……”\n\n“Don’t worry. You taught me well. I don’t do anything dangerous.”\n\n“……”\n\n“But you can’t run away.”\n\nPower entered his thick and tense forearms that tightened her.\n\n“Keep helping me to be a nice person, Scyllia. By my side.” \n\n\nForever.\n\n\nA nine-tailed-fox that is naturally bewitching and eats people.\n\nThe boy who grew up to be huge, refused to become independent.. \n\nWith a face that was so lewd that the discipline she had been teaching in the past would be in vain.>"
