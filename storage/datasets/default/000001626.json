	"description": "A company employee was reincarnated into another world through the work of Gods. So far it goes like your usual light novels' plot, but due to a certain reason and through a certain method, he denied the god's blessing that should have hit him.\r\n\r\nThe man got reincarnated as is without that fact being found out nor questioned.\r\nGrowing up through many hardships without a blessing, he would leave his village alone when he was of age... only to keep getting surprised by this world's common sense. Not to mention his fate of seemingly getting dragged into trouble constantly.\r\n\r\nWhy can't he just live in peace? There was a time when he thought he could lead an uneventful life as an ordinary man...>"
