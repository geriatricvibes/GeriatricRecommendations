	"description": "Daiki Morishita, who transferred to another world and became a hero, came back to Japan, defeating the demon king.\n\nHowever, in fact, in the dark society of Japan, the (in this case rare) world of battle-like battles was expanding.\n\nThis is a story that uses status and skills in modern Japan, and the heroes returning from other worlds apply power leveling to incompetent classmates.>"
