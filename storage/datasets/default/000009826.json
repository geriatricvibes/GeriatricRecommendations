	"description": "I was five years old now.\n\nI was born again as a prince and princess abandoned in the palace with a twin in my previous life.\n\nWe have been abused and abandoned only because our biological mother is low-born.\n\nHer death gave us a chance to escape.\n\n….. A day after we decided to run away, the emperor, who left us with our biological mother to be abused by her hands and left us in an abandoned castle, suddenly came.\n\nYou haven’t been interested in five years, but why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?>"
