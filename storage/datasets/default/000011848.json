	"description": "This path has many ups and downs. People come, people go. \n\nJiang Ling did not have the makings of a martial artist. She once felt inferior, but with a heart full of optimism, she sought another path.  \n\nIn the world on top of the mountain, all she had were her shifu, shijie, and shixiong. When she entered Jianghu, she had to start over from the beginning, and He Xi bursted into her life. This was the first time she had met a foreign woman, and sure enough, she’s as different as the books say. In her ignorance, Jiang Ling did everything with her until she finally started to panic.\n\n⸺ What in the world is wrong with me?\n\n“Don’t avoid me, I grew up on the mountain, and I haven’t seen much of the world.”\n\nFrom opposing each other across a sea of blood to finally joining hands to walk the same path, Jiang Ling has hated and she has loved.>"
