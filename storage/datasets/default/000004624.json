	"description": "This story takes place in a strange world that’s not the earth as we know it. In this world, there are a few so-called Trash Skills that are looked down on.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist is an eight-year-old girl who lives on her own named Marron, who discovers that there is a way to make the horribly disgusting Trash Skill Fruit actually taste good.\r\n\r\nWhile nobody else would even think of eating a Trash Skill Fruit, Marron – her discovery in hand – kept on eating them, until her ‘useless’ Trash Skills became something incredible.\r\n\r\nAll the while, she’s yanked around by a fairy with a superiority complex named Alto and a problematic Japanese boy named Tarō who’s transported to her world.\r\n\r\nDespite that, Marron’s a girl who likes to go at her own pace. This is her adventure!>"
