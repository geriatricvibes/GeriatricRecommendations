	"description": "She was reincarnated in a cold wasteland where romance didn’t exist.\r\n\r\nIt was only a minor role whose name was not even mentioned, so she simply assumed that she would live a life that was far from the original.\r\n\r\nOn the night of a full moon, a male master had come to visit her, possessing a title that didn’t exist in the drama.\r\n\r\n'The Marquis had asked for money in exchange for you.”\r\n\r\nIt took her a while to remember that he was a cold-blooded man who would draw his sword first and ask questions later.\r\n\r\nCherryl realized that her father was trying to sell her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it’s a bad offer.”\r\n\r\nThe problem is that he was a savage monster who wasn’t capable of mercy.\r\n\r\nYet, if she let him go, she would have to be married to an aging, bald Earl.\r\n\r\nCherryl thought about running away at night but instead, she ended up leaving with Cade to the North.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it’s all a coincidence?”\r\n\r\nOn the first night of the wedding, Cade kissed her wet cheeks tenderly and revealed his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Would you believe if I said I was living like a dog for this night?”\r\n\r\n“Your—Your Grace.”\r\n\r\nThe man's golden eyes glittered with insidious longing.>"
