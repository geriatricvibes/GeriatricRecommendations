	"description": "When the bell rang at the end of the school day, I was starving, so I rushed to my usual curry shop and got into an unfortunate car accident – at least I got a bite of my favorite curry before I died, but… …\n\n『Do you want your strength?』\n\n『I wanted to eat ……, you know. ……』\n\n「All right! I’ll give it to you.」\n\n「…… What?」\n\nIn the most important encounter scene with the gods when going to another world, the protagonist, Kanagaki Robun, somehow got the skill 〈Curry〉 due to a slight misunderstanding. For some reason, however, the curry is the strongest and most complete food skill that is not only an all-rounder that attacks, defends, grants, and recovers, but is also all-round, penetrating, and versatile!\n\nThis is the story of Rokubun Kanagaki, who uses his 〈Curry〉skill to help the locals, casually feed his friends, or get caught up in a vicious conspiracy, and eventually establishes not only a curry shop, but also a curry empire, and becomes a warrior in another world! It’s a story.>"
