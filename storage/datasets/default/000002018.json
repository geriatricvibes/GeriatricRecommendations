	"description": "Unable to bear hurting the villain he helped raise, but when it came to compensating with his own body, the unfortunate, straight male reader figured he’d better escape… …\n\nMany years later, the same unfortunate saint rubbed his neck, asking, “This is a dog collar you put on me, isn’t it?”\n\nThe handsome villainous boss gave a glance with his elegant, almond-shaped eyes, and then replied with a devious, charming smile, “That’s to prevent you from running away again.”\n\n“If I stay put, will you refrain from destroying the world?”>"
