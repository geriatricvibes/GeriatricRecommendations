	"description": "Aoto Sakuraba… the definition of a high school student devoted to a peaceful and free life. What he never expected was for Shizuno to come crashing down so suddenly into his life.\n\nShizuno Yuunagi… the dream girl well-known for an alluring appearance, exceptional grades, and a burning passion towards Aoto. Aoto, who refuses to love, denies her confession. However, Yuunagi will not back down and will make him hers.\n\n“I’ll do anything! Please!”\n\n”Well …”\n\nIn the end, Aoto, who could not ignore her, decided to start a relationship with Shizuno.\n\n”But why did you do that?”\n\n“Uh … that’s …”\n\nThe perfect girl Shizuno was impatient. She, who kept observing him, came to a conclusion. Surely, “Aoto Sakuraba is secretly popular.”\n\nThis is a youth romantic comedy about a boy who is unconsciously popular and a beautiful girl who wants to monopolize him.>"
