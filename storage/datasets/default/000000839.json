	"description": "Lady Bertia, who’s become my fiancée, is a bit odd. On our first meeting, she proclaimed herself a  villainess noble girl who’s been reincarnated and said that she’s working hard every day to become a splendid flower of evil that’s elegantly put in her place.\n\nI don’t get it.\n\nBut she entertains me because I don’t understand. \n\nThat’s why I think I’ll observe her for a while.\n\nThis is a story of a crown prince who’s so talented and handsome that he’s grown bored of his easy-mode life. A story of this prince observing a self-proclaimed  villainess noble girl (who seems perfect at first but is a bit off) who’s become his fiancée as she snatches flags and breaks them into pieces.>"
