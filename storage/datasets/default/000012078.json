	"description": "The furthest you can be with someone, is not when you are unable to be  by their side, but when one harbors an unknown one-sided love.\n\nEven while you are by my side, I fail to realize that I love you.\n\nAnd, even though we are this close, one must go left, and the other right.\n\n---\n\nMany years ago, Zheng Xie vowed, “If I am to have any other thoughts about He He, than let me be struck by thunder!”\n\nHe firmly believed that rationality is much stronger than emotions.\n\nMany years later, in ways that he had never expected, he was struck by thunders and earthquakes.>"
