	"description": "Fun things are good things! That's the favorite saying of Yasaburō, third son of the celebrated Shimogamo tanuki clan. Risking the good name of his family, Yasaburō runs wild with his brothers all over the city of Kyōto, where their archrivals, the Ebisugawa clan, hold sway. But things aren't all rosy for the inexperienced tanuki siblings: Yasaburō's mentor, a tengu, has fallen head over talons for a beautiful human woman, and their perfidious tanuki rivals are hatching a dastardly plot. Betrayal, strife, and fluffy love await in Morimi's fantasy masterpiece.>"
