	"description": "Ten years ago, little Cyril said.\n\n“Even if I die with you, I’m not going to marry you!”\n\nJust like that, Adrienne’s first love seemed to end. But one day after coming of age, Cyril regrets those exact words to death.\n\n“Why do you keep making me looking forward, you b*stard! I keep getting it wrong because of you—”\n\nThe last word fell hopelessly between the lips. Adrienne’s shaking shoulder was wrapped gently in Cyril’s hand.\n\n“You're not getting it wrong.”\n\n“…What?”\n\nHer childhood friend, who had been as indifferent as a stone, changed the minute she gave up everything.>"
