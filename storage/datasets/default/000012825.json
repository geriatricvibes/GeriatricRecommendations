	"description": "I possessed a romance-fantasy novel, but I read too much, so I don't know what kind of novel it is.\n\nIf there's anything that might help you figure out where this is,\nThe point is that I have a pine tree taste that only walks on the single path of a male lead.\n\nAmong the not-so-cheeky handsome men in this world... Wouldn't there be a male lead?\n\n-  -  -\n\nEveryone had a plan. Until that plan explodes.\n\n[Quest occurs!]\n[Quest (Main) - 'Correct the world!'\nContent: This world is a world created by mixing four novels - (childcare, contract marriage, XXX, and XXX genres respectively).\nYou must revert to the original four twisted novels.\n.\n.\nFailure: Death]\n\nNo, if you fail, you die? Are you mad?\nI can't remember the content of the novel, but he told me what to do!\n\nSomehow, a twisted existence such as a baby princess full of fun, a Northern Archduke was playing the game...\n\nI can't help it. Let's follow the royal road of romance fantasy, the cliché.\n\nDon't ever ignore romance-fantasy's staunch readers again.\nI must survive!>"
