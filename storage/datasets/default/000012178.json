	"description": "Kit never forgot her first love, Edwin. One day, she realized that Edwin had been sending some kind of signal for help. So she turned back time to the day when he was still alive. Edwin had given up on his life and only waited for his death to come. But when Kit pleaded for his life, his frozen heart thawed a little.\r\n\r\n“Let’s move forward, but this time we will escape death,” she said, “You are not alone. We will do this together.”\r\n\r\nTheir affections for each other grew more as they battled against death. However, there was a dark energy of an inevitable doom that hovered between them….\r\n\r\n“Your presence. You being alive is all that matters to me,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe moment they meet each other over time, their love becomes a stronger reality.>"
