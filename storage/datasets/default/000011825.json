	"description": "Tiariela Norfolk realized that this world was inside the peach-colored ero ero harem story that topped the charts from her past life.\n\nCute like a small animal, the protagonist joins hands with ikemen of superior quality, and it was a story chock full of age 18 restricted scenes.\n\nSince she was a side character, Tiariela welcomed the ero-oyaji inside of her and planned to peek in frequently.\n\nDue to Tiariela’s behavior, the story begins to go amiss...\n\n'I didn’t mean it this way! I just thought that I should study and observe the ecchi scenes (stealthily from nearby) for future reference!'>"
