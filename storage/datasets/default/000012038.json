	"description": "Zou Liang, a man with a passionate interest in a fighting game came into a world governed by the beast tribes.\n\nThere the ones with high martial ability were respected.\n\nExtreme beauties were a little silly.\n\nThis guy felt depressed. Such a crazy world really could force a civilized person like him to turn crazy!\n\nScoundrel Zou began his unrestrained and destructive journey in the Beast God Continent.\n\nRules? There are no rules!\n\nPrinciples? His actions defined the principles!\n\nOccupations? Occupations were as unimportant as fleeting clouds. What he sought was omnipotence!\n\nIn a different world, Zou held the same passion.\n\nThis is a story of a nobody becoming the great conqueror—step by step—as a human, filled with touching emotions, explosive anger, and hot blood forever!>"
