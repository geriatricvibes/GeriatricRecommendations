	"description": "Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan (撲殺天使ドクロちゃん, literally Club-To-Death Angel Dokuro-chan) is a novel series written by Masaki Okayu and illustrated by Torishimo. It centers around a young boy named Kusakabe Sakura and an angel, Dokuro-chan, who comes from the future. She's cute, loving, and frequently kills him violently with a giant spiked club named Excalibolg (only to resurrect him seconds later), but that's how she shows her love for him.>"
