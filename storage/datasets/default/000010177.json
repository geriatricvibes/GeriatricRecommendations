	"description": "Once upon a time, there was a beauty who met nonstop misfortune. This unfortunate man hurried to hug a golden thigh…  \n\nComing from the end of days, the ‘excluding eating there’s only eating in his brain’ Little Useless Eater transmigrated to a ghost story world where it’s difficult to preserve his life. \n\nGood that, not only does his IQ explode the meter, all attribute points are also entirely placed on his face, letting him rely on his otherworldly beauty to find a thick and sturdy big golden thigh. Hugging from world to world, finally, from a pitiful thing being oppressed by demons and monsters on every path, he evolved into a vexatious ghost!>"
