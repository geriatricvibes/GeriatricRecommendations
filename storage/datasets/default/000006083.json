	"description": "“Please, help me travel through the labyrinth to save our kingdom!”\r\n\r\nThe elf girl he saved pledged as the adventurer Alba was about to turn on his heel. With the labyrinth having the rumour of granting whatever you may desire, it actually harbors the secret to ruin the kingdom. Having mistaken Alba for the legendary Dark Knight, the elf girl, the 7th princess of the kingdom, is now asking for his assistance.\r\n\r\n“Declining the request of a girl is really lame, right.”\r\n\r\nHaving been given that world view by his grandfather, as well as the jet-black armor and blood-riddled greatsword, Alba agrees to help them in conquering this deep labyrinth. With the legend of the Dark Knight as its basis, another legend is about to begin!>"
