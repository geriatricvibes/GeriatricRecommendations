	"description": "Yuki, who defeated the popular net game’s Last Boss with the broken character “Sage”, was forcibly reincarnated in a different world.\n\nWhen he woke up, there were seven heroes and a king. Yuki was summoned as the eighth hero.\n\nHowever,\n\n“Sage? I don’t know It. If you’re not a hero then get out of my sight!”\n\nYuki, who was unilaterally banished, was left to survive in a different world with no money.\n\n“This is crazy! They really kicked me out!”\n\nBut the king and the seven heroes didn’t know.\n\nThat “Sage” is the strongest job in another world.\n\n“! … we shouldn’t have banished him that time.” Even if they regretted it, it was already too late.>"
