	"description": "I’m Neferipitou Iceah Freecs and I’m cool as my name. I beat up so many people that they went straight to the hospital because of trying to mess with me. Yes, they do indeed. That’s why my father decided to transfer me to a new school to set me straight. But what they didn’t know is that they sent me to the territory of those whose souls cannot be saved anymore.>"
