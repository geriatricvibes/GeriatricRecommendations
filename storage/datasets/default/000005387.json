	"description": "Rid Baldia, the son of a margrave, suddenly regains the memories of his past life and realizes that the world he lives in greatly resembles the otome game universe of 'Fluttery Cinderella', or 'Flutterella' for short. And it turns out that Rid is a crony bit player that's supposed to take the side of a villainess. And what's more, he remembers that the fate awaiting him for partaking in evil deeds is to be purged, exiled, and condemned alongside the villainess.\r\n\r\nAnd so began the days of Rid Baldia employing the memories of his past life to struggle(mow) his way through this utterly completionist otome game world to have a shot at a decent life.>"
