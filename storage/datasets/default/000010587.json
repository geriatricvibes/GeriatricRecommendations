The super as*hole school bully who can’t get 100 points in all nine subjects is his father?!\n\nThat cold, unfeeling, kaolin flower, iceberg person, the most alpha Alpha in the whole school whom no one dares approach within a 500-mile radius is his mother???\n\nWait, mom! Were you so wild when you were young? You’re pretending to be an alpha!\n\nWait, Dad!! That’s your wife!! Is it really okay for you to fight with him now!!>"
