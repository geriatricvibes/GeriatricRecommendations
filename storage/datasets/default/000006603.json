	"description": "One day, a train accident occurred in the morning. It was the start of everything. The people who were riding on it were invited into a white space. What awaited them there was an old man who claimed to be god.\r\n\r\nThe old man said:\r\n\r\n—- I will transfer you guys to a different world.\r\n\r\n—- I will give you a power to help you survive.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundreds of cards facing down appeared in the mid air.\r\n\r\nWhen a certain male student drew his card, what was written was [Spear Talent] [Great] [★★★]. When a female student drew her card, what was written was [Talent of Water System Magic] [Small] [★★]\r\n\r\nAnd the card that a certain man drew…\r\n\r\nWhat Fujiwara Nobuhide, a trivial temporary employee drew, was [The ability to make a town] [★★★★★★★★★★].\r\n\r\nThis is story of a certain man who has the ability to make a town in a different world. At first, it started as something like Edo from the Tokugawa Period. However, my goal is a modern city. I’ll do my best!>"
