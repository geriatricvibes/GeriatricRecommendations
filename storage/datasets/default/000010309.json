	"description": "I, Rose Hailon grew up to be a noble princess.\n\nOne day, when Cecilia, a friend of mine, becomes my foster sister, she took everything away from me right under my nose.\n\nI was deprived of my status as a princess and eventually had to choose death. I died all alone.\n\nBut what kind of God’s prank is this?\n\nAfter I opened my eyes, I’d gone back to the day Cecilia became my foster sister…\n\nThis is an opportunity that might never happen again. So…\n\n‘Cecilia, I swear I’m going to take off your mask and I’ll start today.’>"
