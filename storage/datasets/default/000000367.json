	"description": "Angel In Online Common name AI-On . \n\nIt is VRMMO which was released the fifth in the world. Ogami Taiga will play with a girl’s avatar due to a reading error on the VR machine. \n\nMoreover, it is a magical girl with some skill. In spite of such appearance, he will use his cheat skills to play his own with out-of-system skills, but he will defeat the king who is one of the bosses with solo. But it was the beginning of the death game … \n\nIt is a VRMMO thing that tends to be. It is nice if you can read it with warm eyes though it includes savagism.>"
