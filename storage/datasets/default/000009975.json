	"description": "I thought I would live a better life in my second lifetime. Unbelievably, I’ve reincarnated into a slime that rolls around on the ground. Anyway, this is my precious new life, so I must work hard. \r\n\r\nBut I can’t believe the type of owner I must live with for the rest of my life. All he says is, ‘I’m lazy.’ He’s the black dragon, Kalgilm. \r\n\r\nWhile I’m the lowest class monster slime that must serve under him. >"
