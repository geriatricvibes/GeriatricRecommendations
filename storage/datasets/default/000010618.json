Come here.\r\n\r\nHolding the tragic mood of being exposed to the wilderness, Ji Xingjue followed Qi Qing to the Civil Affairs Bureau.\r\n\r\nJi Xingjue:?\r\n\r\nQi Qing: The handwriting is more attractive.\r\n\r\nJi Xingjue: ...?\r\n\r\nPeople in the Imperial Capital who are eating melon seeds:????\r\n\r\nJi Xingjue, who was forcibly married: I gave my life to science.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPeople of the Imperial Capital: This must be a unique kind of revenge!\r\n\r\nJi Xingjue, who was  at his last gasp: I never thought of being retaliated like this.\r\n\r\nThe marshal raised his eyebrows calmly: It's very simple, either 'live' or die.>"
