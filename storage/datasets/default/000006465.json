	"description": "‘If you want to kill me, be honest. I will die.’\r\n\r\nAs rumoured, the Fourth Prince, who had seemed frail and meek when he was berated during their first meeting, had a rather picky and eccentric personality.\r\n\r\n“There is only one thing I want. Make a place for me to be by your side.”\r\n\r\nIt was a reunion after 6 years, and a marriage proposal.\r\n\r\n“If I fulfil your wishes, what will you give me?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll give you my everything.”\r\n\r\nA knight who lost her family to an enemy spy, was praised as a war hero.\r\n\r\nA half prince who inherited the blood of an enemy country, was ignored as a shame of the royal family.\r\n\r\nThe couple’s marriage caused a stir throughout the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n‘There is no need for love between you and me.’\r\n\r\nReasonable distance. \r\n\r\nModerate affection.\r\n\r\nA relationship where you know each other but nothing in detail.\r\n\r\n“Adora, what’s really important is that I’m the only one who should know.”\r\n\r\nIt was like showing a beautifully wrapped surface.\r\n\r\nThe important part was cleverly hidden.\r\n\r\nIt was so pretty and so alluring that anyone could be tempted.\r\n\r\nThe man who reunited after six years was definitely different.\r\n>"
