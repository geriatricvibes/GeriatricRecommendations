	"description": "[How could a s*ave know more about money than a master such as I] \n\nA quote by the president of Hanbo Group, Jung Tae Soo during the Congressional hearing. \n\nThey are called employees, salarymen, but in truth they were s*aves.\n\n I was a s*ave.\n\n But I’ve put everything I’ve had to become a butler. Instead, all I’ve got was an ending befitting of an abandoned s*ave. \n\nAnd the blessings of the god.>"
