	"description": "A plain guy who attends a prefectural high school in Minamisou in the Chiba prefecture, Iijima Yasuki, lived through gray days in his Science class.\n\nDespite this, on the last night of the study training camp just before summer vacation, he helped the school’s number one beauty, Kitaoka Ema, when she was in trouble.\n\nNow for some reason Ema has become pleased with him. However, she only talks to him outside of school. In the classroom she pretends not to know him.\n\nJust what is Ema thinking?\n\nThere is a hierarchy in the school, with a disparity between a plain-type glasses boy and a flashy-type girl.\n\nTwo existences that were supposed to run counter to each other; a passing love story.>"
