	"description": "The richest woman in the world, Laurentia Aztana, had success in both work and beauty, but her life was unhappy. She discovered that the illness of her sister, Erusia, was a complete lie, and that she was cooperating with her fiancé to buy all of her possessions. It was a treacherous story of betrayal.\n\nAt the moment Laurentia was forced to turn her back on her pain and remorse, she had gone back eleven years before her engagement. Her faith in Erusia, her affection for her fiancé; all of it could go to hell. Listen carefully, Sister, there is no good sister now. I pledge to redesign my life.\n\nThe first thing is, I’m tied up with a national hero who cannot possibly deal with the trash left in the past. Oh, the debt that you took unfairly, I’ll fix it. Instead, become my marriage partner.>"
