	"description": "After clearing, Lee Danwoo died. A sword pierced his neck, the ceiling collapsed, and nobody survived. However, when he opened his eyes again, he had returned to before his death. \n\nCha Woowon died in the first raid and Danwoo was the lone survivor. Was that what he wished for?\n\n“Are you okay? You’re sweating.”\n\nYoung Cha Woowon, who didn’t know Danwoo, spoke. Danwoo barely nodded his head.\n\n“You’re crying.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nHe had plenty of regrets.\n\nLee Danwoo returned to the time before the most regrettable thing happened.\n\n—\n\n“A monster is about to crush 30 people in front of you. If you stop it, you will die, but they will live. What will you do?”\n\nCha Woowon answered Danwoo’s question without hesitation.\n\n“It seems like the right decision is for me to block it.”\n\n‘This guy sure is a good kid…’\n\nThere was an urgent solution, whether it was a strategy or not.\n\nWhy did Cha Woowon die in the raid? His good personality was the problem, without a doubt.\n\nThis time, Danwoo would save him.\n\nBy tearing up that good human nature of his.>"
