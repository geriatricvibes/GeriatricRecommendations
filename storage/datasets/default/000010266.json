Suddenly, a series of skill cards appeared.\n\n「Pistol Master」\n\n「Martial Arts Master」\n\n「Shield Defense Master」\n\n「Super Soldier Serum」\n\nWhich skill card do you wish to extract?\n\n“Wait… what? This golden finger… you must be pulling my leg! Not only skill cards but I can also extract super-powered skills like the Super Soldier Serum? Mother of God… what is this?!”>"
