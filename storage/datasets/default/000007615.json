	"description": "When Yukio Tateyama, a 31-year-old virgin, was on his way home from a party and thought he was stabbed to death by a street thief, he somehow woke up in an unknown forest. For some reason, he wakes up in a strange forest. Moreover, his appearance becomes that of a small girl of about eight years old, and even his speech and behavior regress to infantile.\n\nAccording to an autonomous robot (?) that he met in the ruins of the forest,  this world has a system of skills, jobs, and levels, which makes it extremely difficult for a young girl to live.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, she gets a new name, Yuki, and uses her unknowingly acquired cheat skills to master all sorts of jobs, including magic, lumbering, construction, alchemy, and blacksmithing.\n\nThis is a story about a man who is reincarnated as a beautiful little girl, and even though he is thrown out into the forest, he uses the system to survive, and although he is supposed to be able to choose only two jobs in his life, he is the only one in the world who has all the jobs and is called the 'Saintess of Creation'.\n>"
