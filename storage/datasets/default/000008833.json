	"description": "“Has the blind princess not opened her eyes yet?”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe gazes cast upon Ariel, who is blind, have always remained the same.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEither with ridicule and contempt, or a sympathetic gaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThe man acknowledged as the best groom in the empire, proposed to such an Ariel. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt could have been due to his family, it could have been sympathy. Ariel, who had nowhere to go, accepted his proposal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe was prepared to accept the contempt of others by standing beside him. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Wife, can you see my face?”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe man did not ignore her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe didn’t even take in a mistress, nor did he hit her. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAriel was relieved by his dignified speech, his elegant attitude, and his considerate touch.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“I am alright.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe was.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe thought that it would be okay… But this marriage turned out better than she expected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“I…I guess I must have fallen for the Count.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWithout knowledge of the Count’s true colours, Ariel fell for him. \r\n>"
