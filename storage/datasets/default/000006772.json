	"description": "Pu Tao heard a voice that made her fall head over heels in love with and she couldn’t sleep at night.\n\nAfter that, she secretly sent a private message to the voice’s owner: I don’t mean to bother you, but my ears say they want to know you.\n\n–\n\nCheng Su met a bold girl.\n\nShe forced him to hand over his Wechat ID and even wanted him to send her a voice message saying good night to her every day.\n\nLater, he thought that it would be unfortunate to not be her boyfriend after selling his voice for so long. \n\nOne day before going to bed, he said, “I don’t want to be a white prostituted[1].”\n\nThe next day, the girl rushed to his livestream to deliver a lot of presents.\n\nHim: “You know that’s not what I was talking about.”\n\n[1]白嫖 (báipiáo) – Internet term meaning fans who do not spend money on their idol.>"
