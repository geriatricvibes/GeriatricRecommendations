	"description": "Xie Luan had always believed in science until one day, a meteorite smashed into his yard, forcing him to bind to a heroic world saving script. The worst thing was that the script didn’t even follow common sense.\n\nOthers become superheros while he became a super-nanny. So in his left hand was a “Cub Encyclopedia” and in the right, a small milk bottle to feed the small cub clinging onto his leg.\n\nToday, Xie Luan is trying his best to save the world.>"
