It said that in order to reset, I had to find the most beautiful thing in the world.\r\n\r\nClinging to a ray of hope, I set out on a journey to find you again.\r\n\r\nMy companion on this journey is a mysterious cat-headed man named Crescent. As he leads me, I search for clues to the 'reset' and travel to places that remind me of you.\r\n\r\nThe school building where we spent time together.\r\nThe mysterious coffee shop we visited on our first date.\r\nThe tree-lined avenue in the park where the illumination shines.\r\n\r\nIn this way, I reach the secret of 'Reset' and you once again.>"
