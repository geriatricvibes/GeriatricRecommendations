	"description": "There’s nothing that Yu Wan has in common with her new neighbor– whether it’s charisma, personality, or cooking skills– other than that they both own dogs. Their two cute pets get along well (a bit far too well) and start what seems like a rocky friendship between the two; however, Yu Wan has more important things to worry about. Her wildly popular novel is about to take off into a drama adaptation, but the handsome, mysterious, and callous neighbor- is the director?!\n\n[Reporter: I’ve heard that you really like raising pets, Director Shen. You have two of them, right?\n\nShen Qingzhou (As he thinks of someone): I’d say three.]>"
