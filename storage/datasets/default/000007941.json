	"description": "Lawrence Devitch, a young banker who dominated the Kosimo Empire.\r\n\r\nOne day, Rahee, a mixed-race girl thrown at him instead of debt.\r\n\r\n'Please accept me as a maid .'\r\n\r\nIt was just a collateral. But.......\r\n\r\nThe girl is a lady, it began to occur a crack on his frozen heart .\r\n\r\n'The contract should have been prudent. It was what you wanted in the first place. So don't blame me. What I see is not money, but you.'\r\n\r\n'You want me to pay off your debts, right?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. I want to pay you back. But I have to pay it my way, not your way. That's right.'\r\n\r\nTo hold her, he did not hesitate to use any tricks.\r\n\r\nDare! Do not allow her to escape.>"
