	"description": "I once asked myself whether I had ever experienced anything… so unforgettable that it was carved deeply into my bones.\r\n\r\nThen I thought carefully about it.\r\n\r\nActually, my life was pretty average and rather peaceful.\r\n\r\nIt was probably because I was still young.\r\n\r\nBut upon thinking even more seriously, it seems like I’ve ever really hated one person.\r\n\r\nMy mum.>"
