	"description": "The upperclassman that I had a crush on for two years got together with another classmate. I’m bound to be expelled if I continue to keep harassing them out of jealousy like this. \n\nI didn’t believe in predestination, so I kept on denying it, but I eventually decided to come to terms with it. \n\nI don’t want to be expelled, so I’ll have to put an end to this crush that I have. \n\n… And yet, I should at least try to confess my love. \n\n“I really like him a lot. Also, I’m going to drop out of the club.” \n\nThe only place that I get to meet him is at that club. So, if I drop out of it, I wouldn’t have to worry about seeing him anymore. At least, that’s my thinking anyway. \n\n“Come on, I’ll take you.” \n\n“You’re wearing glasses? You look so pretty.” \n\n“Eat well.”  \n\nWhy are you… being so nice to me?>"
