	"description": "Su Li, who failed 10 consecutive missions in the story preservation department, finally had the opportunity to change departments. So… after punishing the rich son, the pretentious king, the overbearing president, and the selfish prince, Su Li said that the revenge tasks were simply a piece of cake for her~ \n\nHer stories were about women who met tragic ends, now coming back to punish scumbags, faceslap the white lotuses, and then live happily ever after with an awesome husband.>"
