	"description": "One day the glaciers melted and the sleeping zombie virus invaded the world, mutating ABO’s to varying degrees. \n\nAnd Omegas, who have always been weak, became one of the most intractable corpses during those last days of the apocalypse.\n\nIn order to obtain first-hand technical information from the outside world, the beta Cheng Jian, who just graduated from the Academia Sinica, was dispatched to the special operations team and became a technical soldier. \n\nNot only does she have to face the more arrogant Alpha teammates while the apocalypse rages around them every day, but even more terrible than that, she has to endure the iceberg-like Squad Captain. \n\nAfter graduating from military academy, all Cheng Jian wanted was to be a secretary for a young Ph. D doctor in a split officer’s dress! \n\nSo why did you send me to kill zombies, then?! All I actually got was a zombie and an even more terrifying boss! \n\nXu Wei glanced at her coldly, “Stare at me like that again and I’ll throw you off the helicopter.” \n\nCheng Jian quickly glanced down where countless zombies crowded in the abandoned city, stretching their arms crazily upwards. She withered and defectively thought that her mother shouldn’t have given birth to her.>"
