	"description": "Gabrielle, a daughter of a Duke, was exiled from her country for a crime of bullying a certain Viscount’s daughter she didn’t commit.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was that all the people who condemned her were under the charm spell of the Viscount’s daughter.\r\n\r\nGabrielle, who was the only one to notice this during the condemnation, decided to cancel out the charm spell as a parting gift when leaving the country.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone and the charm was broken, the country was filled with a storm of regret.\r\n\r\nThey have done something terrible.\r\n\r\nWhile they continued to suffer in guilt, Gabrielle was traveling normally.>"
