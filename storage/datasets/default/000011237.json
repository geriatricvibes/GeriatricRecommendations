	"description": "I heard that recently the Underworld has opened a new “present life” business—\r\n\r\nJiang Yuyan, as a salesperson in the emotional unit, started her helper business on Earth.\r\n\r\n“I have a commission! I want to retaliate against those scum men and women!”\r\n\r\n“The Underworld’s self-service system has accepted your request.”\r\n\r\n“I have a request! Please bring my ex-boyfriend down too!”\r\n\r\n“The local government self-service system has accepted your request. Commissioned.”\r\n\r\n..Huh, wait! Bring down?\r\n\r\nThe system was stunned: Wait, Jiang Yuyan… stop! We are not omnipotent! This commission cannot be accepted!\r\n\r\nThere are fewer scum men and women in the world, but the system of the Underworld is crying—\r\n\r\nJiang Yuyan, don’t pretend to be forced by the Underworld!>"
