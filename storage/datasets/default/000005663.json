	"description": "Man, you’re my man, the time we spent together...\n\nHis chest seemed to have been burned by the fire. It hurt so much, but it could not compare with the gaze of the man standing in front of him. His eyes was gentle but brought him heartache, so that Pei Yi lost all of his courage and wanted to escape.\n\n“I’m back... Pei Yi.”\n\nFamiliar tone and long-lost voice suddenly came into Pei Yi’s ears.\n\nPei Yi’s eyes turned red in an instant.\n\nShen Dian.\n\nIt’s Shen Dian!\n\nHe came back...\n\nPei Yi was shocked and widened his eyes, staring at the face in disbelief. That face should have faded away in his memory but was indeed clear in his mind at this moment.\n\nHe still couldn’t believe it.\n\nShen Dian was really back and even gracefully showed up in front of him in spite of everything.\n\nHis mind went blank and his eyes were blurred.\n\nUntil hearing that familiar name again, Pei Yi accepted the truth that Shen Dian was really... back.\n\n“...Haven’t seen you for a long time, Xiaoyi.”\n\nXiaoyi.\n\nHe called him lovingly. Only one person in this world would call him like this.\n\nIt was Shen Dian.>"
