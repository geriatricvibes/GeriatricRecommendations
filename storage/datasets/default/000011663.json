	"description": "Xiao Chen, “the waste” of Xiao clan, had his engagement to the Young Lady of the Yang clan renounced.\n\nAnd when he arrived at the sect that sympathized with him and took him in, he found corpses strewn all over the place and a mist of blood in the air. The sect was exterminated by a mysterious group that was looking for the ‘Wind Spirit Jade’.\n\nHe himself was left behind only half-dead for ‘wastes do not deserve to die by their hand’. Humiliated once more and on the verge of death, in the surroundings strangeness happened. A whirlpool sucked up the blood mist and  diverted it into Xiao Chen’s forehead, transforming and enhancing his body.>"
