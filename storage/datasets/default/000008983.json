	"description": "I, the Duke’s daughter Carol Ambrose, one day suddenly had my engagement broken by my fiancé his Highness Reyford. I completely don’t have any recollection of harassing or trying to push anyone off the stairs though. But since it’s a good opportunity, I think I’ll propose to the Knight Captain I’ve yearned for ever since I was young. Because towards the white bearded and 62 years old knight captain Wilhelm-sama, there isn’t a single frivolous rumor and he’s still a bachelor.>"
