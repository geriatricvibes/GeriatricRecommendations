	"description": "There was a prominent old martial arts family which in the hundred years would give birth only to males, never a girl. Finally, one day, a girl was born. She was a tassel blower among ten thousand green groves. Ultimately, she turned into an agile and brave tomboy!\n\nThere was also an imperial descendant who his old father had six princesses. His father was just short of a son to inherit the throne. Finally, one day, he got a bastard son who was his youngest child. With countless spoiling, in the end that son was brought up into a universally unmatched egomania!\n\n'Zhen as the nation's number one beauty, as the nation only first class figure, obviously needs to have a professional bodyguard constantly at our side for protection. That will be you, the iron-willed female King Kong pretending to be a little eunuch.'>"
