I will construct a pub so I can make ten draws in a row; 　　\n\nLack of food? I can’t be too cheap with the large pack full of food supplies sent from the market;\n\nLack of safety? Arrow Tower, Mage Tower Artillery and all kinds of automatic defence buildings. Having many isn’t too many;\n\nLack of equipment? Workshop production must produce high-quality items. Sir, would you like one? We are having a 20% discount special at nine!\n\n…………　\n\nIn short, this is a story of Great Lord Tang building up his territory, attacking some monsters, and ripping off…… Cough, making some money at the same time.>"
