	"description": "The more followers a Deity has, the more powerful he becomes! \r\n\r\nYu Sheng’an who receives the Contract Divinity accidentally, has to evade the other deities who are hunting for him, while gaining enough power to return home. \r\n\r\nHence, he comes up with an idea, “There’s no need to preach. Isn’t that the same old maneuver the Internet uses to gain and expand their userbase back home?” \r\n\r\nSee how he gains power and followers in the magical world with: \r\n\r\nSocial media accounts; \r\n\r\nShort video downloads; \r\n\r\nQ&A online platform; \r\n\r\nLive broadcast; \r\n\r\nE-commerce. \r\n\r\nThen, watch him unleash the users on those deities as he overthrows their heresy!>"
