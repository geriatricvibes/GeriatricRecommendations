	"description": "The web novel author Mo Yan trasmigrated to ancient China and experienced life there.\n\nHer new body was weak and sickly, and she just so happened to have a short-tempered mother who favoured sons over daughters. Each day was filled with arguments, and she was never full. It was such a bitter life! Thankfully, she still had an older sister who still cared for her.\n\nTo put food on the table, she started studying, fed ducks, dug for medicinal herbs, and even opened a shop with her sister.\n\nShe used brains to outwit her mother and earn her sister happiness. She taught her useless dad a lesson and kept mistresses away. She kept her lazy brother in line and made him take on responsibility.\n\nWith her careful planning, her life got better and better. And as the cold winters passed, Mo Yan grew up.>"
