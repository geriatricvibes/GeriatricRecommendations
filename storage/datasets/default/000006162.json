	"description": "“A woman who does not know love, may you know the joy of pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe curse of lust placed on Lewellyn, a princess who was once revered but miserably abandoned.\r\nIn order to prevent the curse, she would have to spend the night with a man!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe eventually opens her own private bedroom…\r\n\r\nChildhood friend Armandite, who returned as a hero of the Holy Sword,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCommander Tristan, who is as blunt as a rock, but somehow wanders around her.\r\n\r\nBeautiful but somehow twisted, Holy Priest Ernel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd, watching her, ‘someone.’\r\n\r\nWill she be able to break the curse safely?\r\n\r\nWho will be with the cursed princess?\r\n–\r\n\r\n“It sounds lovely.”\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled beautifully.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\n“Princess, do you like my body, not me?”\r\n\r\n \r\nTristan said in a voice that had everything crumbled.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\n \r\n“I mean.”\r\n\r\n“… … .”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to hold you like this.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!”\r\n\r\n\r\nLewellyn gasped and looked at Armandite.>"
