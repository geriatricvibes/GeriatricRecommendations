	"description": "When I turned 15, I became an adventurer, and left the orphanage where I grew up. My destination is a region where beastmen live. Being there might make my dreams come true!\r\n\r\nI don’t know the whole story about my birth, but for some reason my magical power is high, and I can use a lot of spells. Thus, I am gifted with the required knowledge to handle magic. Will I find those answers as I carry out my adventures? But, much more important than that is to fulfill my dreams!\r\n\r\nThat’s why I decided to become an adventurer! However, I am a sorcerer who is not good at offensive magic, but I am very good at support magic. I would like to find a reliable partner. I wonder if there is someone... And in this way, my full-of-trouble journey started! So... please bear with me!>"
