	"description": "\r\n\r\n\r\nHer husband had a woman. From the moment she found out the secret, her perfect family fell apart. \r\n\r\nIn spite of this, she turned a blind eye to it and in return, Rivianna lost her child. \r\n\r\nShe wanted to die, but a cruel fate brought her back to life. \r\n\r\nAnd so life began again. Rivianna decided not to get divorced again this time.\r\n\r\n Instead, she made up her mind. She would sell her husband.\r\n\r\n 'Do you know that there are a surprising number of people who want you to disappear.'\r\n\r\n 'What?' \r\n\r\n“So I sold you.”\r\n\r\nShe sold her husband to the person who gave her the highest price out of all the people who hated her husband.\r\n\r\n 'Aren’t you curious? Who really bought you?'\r\n>"
