	"description": "Kein, a middle-aged adventurer, found a very rare item, the 『Resurrection fruit』 in the middle of his everyday routine herb gathering.\n\nHe contemplated selling it for a lot of money, but suddenly met a girl looking for the fruit to save her companion’s life. \n\nShe reminded him of Altena, his childhood friend who had passed away, so he gave it to her in exchange for a paltry sum.\n\nIn truth, the girl was actually the strongest adventurer Anastrea, known far and wide as the ‘Sword Princess’. \n\nThe next day, the lowly D rank Kein suddenly received an invitation to join an S rank party… he managed to defeat a terrible and strong monster and miraculously gained lots of money… and finally recieved a confession from a 13 year old saint.\n\nKein’s previously simple life is changed completely because of his encounter with Anastrea.>"
