	"description": "One hundred thousand years ago, the once influential Church of Calamity was destroyed. Since then, necromancy had been lost to the ages.\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand years later, a poor street urchin living in a mountain village, Roan, who dreams of becoming a great wizard, by some twist of fate, finds a seemingly ordinary ring. Coincidentally, this ring happened to hold a spirit that was one hundred thousand years old.\r\n\r\nIn a continent where magical combat runs wild, the mysterious, terrifying and powerful magic of necromancy returns. What kind of waves will it cause?\r\n\r\nNow a necromancer, Roan chases the truth behind necromancy’s disappearance one hundred thousand years ago.>"
