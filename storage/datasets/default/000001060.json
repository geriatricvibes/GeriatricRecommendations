So she finally stopped struggling and obediently surrendered…\n\nShan Shan, extremely docile, waited outside the delivery room at the temporary blood bank. At the same time, the big boss sent her away to do a blood test to ensure she was of good health and suitable blood type.\n\nSure enough, the pregnant woman was in a critical condition. Thus, Shan Shan obediently let 300 cc of her blood being pumped. The condition of the pregnant woman improved. Shan Shan received many thanks, left the hospital and lamented this while looking at the moon:\n\n“Capitalists really are blood-suckers, heartless, heartless.”\n\nShan Shan, who is deep in thought, did not notice a black limousine has stopped behind her. The man at the back seat heard her sigh, moved his mouth and then closed the recently opened window.\n\n“Drive home.”\n\n“Boss, didn't you just say you want to send Miss Xue back?”\n\n“No need,” the man said without expression, “capitalists are heartless.”>"
