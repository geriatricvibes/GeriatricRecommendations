Tang Xiu discovered with amazement that ten thousand years passed in the Immortal World, yet only a single year passed on Earth.\r\n\r\nRuthlessly betrayed by his lover and trusted friends, Tang Xiu found that his soul went back to his previous body on Earth, and, despite he spent 10,000 years in the Immortal World, just a year has passed on Earth and many things have changed. Having an unsurpassed knowledge, Tang Xiu will protect his loved ones and go back to the Immortal World to take his revenge.>"
