After becoming 26 years old, the former magical girl, Mitsukasa Michi gave a sideward glance to her comrades who were being lauded as heroes, while she alone hid her true identity and lived a normal life as a teacher at a school for people with supernatural talents. If she desired it, she could have status and fame and money in her grasp. However, she had a reason that ab~solutely forced her to hide her true identity…\r\n\r\nThis is a unusual modern day fantasy about an adult woman, who cannot reveal herself as a magical girl, unconsciously raising flags with her former ikemen comrades, young male colleagues that she has friendly relations with, as well as beautiful female students, all while desperately trying to conceal her true identity.>"
