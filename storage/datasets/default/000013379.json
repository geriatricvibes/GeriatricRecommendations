	"description": "I have a childhood friend.\r\n\r\nWe did stupid things, made the adults angry, were put to cleaning the toilets together, complained it was a pain and went off to play, only to make them angry again. When we were kicked out to sleep in the shed, we made a ruckus all the way through the night, received the iron fist to the head, and grew older together.\r\n\r\nThat friend became the hero and saved the world.>"
