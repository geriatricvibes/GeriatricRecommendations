	"description": "A fanfiction of 【Fake Slackers】.\r\n\r\n'Hè Zhāo takes in the sight of him from behind. This vulnerable yet obstinate action of his elbows causes his butterfly bones to rise to prominence. In the blurry shadows cast by the dim light, they look just like the fluttering wings of a butterfly, on the verge of breaking out of its pupa.'>"
