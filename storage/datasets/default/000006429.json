	"description": "Betrayed by my most trusted companion, I was banished. I closed my eyes as I vowed for revenge, so how come I became the child of the Duke of the Empire of Heiron, which has been at odds with Cillophia?\n\nThe problem was…\n\n“Abuu!”\n\n“Ah, it’s really annoying. Keep on biting your pacifier.”\n\nMy eyes widened as I sucked on the pacifier in a reflex.\n\n‘What did I just do?’\n\nHas my brain been filled with water and ran off because of the pacifier?\n\nEven without the pacifier, I have completely become a newborn with a head full of flowers.\n\nThis was the biggest stain in the life of the Sorceress Hella.\n\n‘Since it has already become like this, then I’ll just steal some top secret and go back.’\n\nI have to be unnoticed and covert!\n\nToday too, Celina’s been crawling desperately between the pillars and trees.\n\n“That… Whose child is that? Who’s taking care of the child like that?”\n\nAn angry roar resounded behind her but it was none of Celina’s business.>"
