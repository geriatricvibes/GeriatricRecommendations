	"description": "I was abused by my parents and about to be sold into s*avery, so I took my own life.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I found myself in a different world. In a world where the color of one’s hair determines the magic one can use, and those with hair of a certain color cannot use magic and are scorned, I was reborn with black hair, which is ridiculed as the most inferior hair color.\r\n\r\nI was fed up with the misfortune from my previous life and almost gave up on everything, but now I decided to continue to live.\r\n\r\nI met my master who told me, “If you are going to throw away your life, use it for me rather than wasting it.\r\n\r\nMy life changed when I met my master who said that to me.\r\n\r\nI made a vow. I vowed to devote my life to Noah- sama.\r\n\r\nI will follow you on your journey to the very end.\r\n\r\nSo, Noah-sama, please be a little less selfish!>"
