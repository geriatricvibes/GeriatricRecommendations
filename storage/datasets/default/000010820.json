	"description": "“I will appraise all of you”\n\nAppraiser Io does his job of appraising everything from monsters brought in to the adventurers guild he’s attached to, to examining an ambitious young man’s aptitude for adventuring, and the diverse areas in which he’ll succeed.\n\nAnd today, while surrounded by his colleagues, a butcher who believes himself to be the height of physical beauty and a feminine, yet aggressive-looking, guild master, he appraised several items, entertained an adventurer, and ran through the occasional dungeon. And so this is how he passes his busy days, all while in the corner of his heart he thinks, “One day the time will come where I’ll get to rejoice over the stress of a big job.”\n\nHere is an everyday story depicting the adventures of how this anywhere and everywhere sort of appraiser passes his days.>"
