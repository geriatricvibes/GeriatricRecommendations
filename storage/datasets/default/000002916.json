	"description": "After the ‘100-Year War’ between the Necromancers and Priests, an all-time genius who’ll shake the power structure was born.\r\n\r\n“Am I a rare case or something? Do I have talent?”\r\n\r\nA potential beyond all imagination.\r\nHe obtained his father’s undead army and entered the great Necromancer school of Kizen that divided the continent.\r\n\r\nGeniuses are geniuses, even when gathered among the elites.\r\nThe research community was flipped on its head by the appearance of a new case.\r\nProfessors wouldn’t leave him be alone, wanting to make him study directly under them.\r\nOfficials from all over the kingdom and heads of organizations fidgeted over whether to scout him.\r\n\r\n“Professor! When can I make a Lich?”\r\n“Gimme a break. How talented are you? You’re crossing the line, honestly.”\r\n\r\nA genius among geniuses had appeared.>"
