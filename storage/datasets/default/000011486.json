	"description": "He plucks a star from the sky; he burns a cluster of ashes on the ground.\n\nFor Chi Qiu, Lu Ming is an unreachable star in the sky.\nUntil one day, the star itself falls into his hands and says to him: I love you, I love you.\nChi Qiu believes it.\n\nFor Lu Ming, Chi Qiu is a small fire hidden in the dark. You see, he is obedient like a flower in a greenhouse. But in fact, he is lonely and stubborn, burning to ashes in the spring.\n\nLu Ming becomes Chi Qiu’s star and spring.\n\n— “Lu Ming, in fact, it doesn’t matter who you marry. Just because I can’t see, so it’s the most convenient for you, right?”\n— “Chi Qiu, I want to return the spring to you.”>"
