	"description": "Timeriders can freeze time for one second for every 200,000 words they read. Neat trick, wouldn’t you say? But what happens when they stop reading? Pretty much what happens when a normal human being stops eating.\r\n\r\nTokinori Rinne follows the spon­taneous summer adventures of a chipper group of kids, led by Rinne Mitsukuri Meyerhold, a human / timerider hybrid, and Kodaka Kusumoto, her next-door neighbor. Nothing can go wrong there, right? Right…?\r\n\r\nWell… for starters, Rinne really hates reading.>"
