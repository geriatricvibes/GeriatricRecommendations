	"description": "When a genius poisoner and a vicious concubine meet, when chemicals will they have? It is said the Prince Regent dotes on his concubine. As long as she wants something, he will get it for her no matter what! It is also said the Prince Regent hates the concubine. On their wedding day, he directly throws the concubine out of the mansion! Since Nagong Ning marries into the Prince Regent Mansion, all kinds of rumors make a great clamor. For this, Nangong Ning admits it all true. But she just ignores it…she had just developed a new kind of poison. What about using it on him tonight? Otherwise, her night…was way too long!>"
