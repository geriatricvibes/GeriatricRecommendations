This hairstyle in this magazine is amazing!”\n\n“I don’t really get it, but it does look amazing!”\n\n“So I’d like to ask again if you could style my hair like that…can you set it up for me, Otaku-kun?”\n\n“I might be able to do this with hair extensions. If you don’t mind, I’ll be glad to do it!”\n\n“Really?! You’re the best, Otaku-kun!”\n\nThis is a school romantic comedy about an otaku who appreciates the hobbies of a gal and a gal who appreciates the hobbies of an otaku.>"
