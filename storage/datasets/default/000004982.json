	"description": "What? The school bully began to hit his face again. He had a fight with the newly transferred student the day before yesterday, and today he hid behind others.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting Liang Xi, Xia Ze went further and further on the road.\r\n\r\nXia Ze: So what … Mm-hmm! (I like you! )\r\n\r\nLiang Xi: What did you say?\r\n\r\nXia Ze: I said you are ugly! (Yes, I am scared)\r\n\r\nCrowd: I can’t believe that the school bully who doesn’t take no for an answer has such a wimpish moment.\r\n\r\nXia Ze shook his head helplessly: hey! I didn’t know that my boyfriend, who was a little puppy at the mercy of the slaughter, would become my big attacker.>"
