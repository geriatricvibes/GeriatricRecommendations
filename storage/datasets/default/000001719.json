	"description": "An abnormally fiery night she spent with a man whose life she accidentally saved.\n\nA single day’s mistake came back with great return.\n\n“You’re pregnant.”\n\nRosena, who abandoned everything and lived in hiding raising a child.\n\nMany things have changed in the Empire, which she returned to after seven years. But the father of her child is the lunatic third prince?\n\n***\n\nYerhan stopped just two hand spans away from Rosena.\n\nSoon after, a gentle voice sank on Rosena’s neckline.\n\n“Please choose, leave this place and the child behind…..”\n\nThe golden eyelashes, which had been slightly lowered, rose, and the shining eyes turned to Rosena.\n\n“Or will you marry me and stay with the child?”>"
