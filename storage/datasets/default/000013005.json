	"description": "I did not wish to be born like this.\n\nI spent a shitty life and until the last moment getting killed, every day of my life is full of sadness.\n\nI did not think it was mortifying. It did not seem to be mortifying.\n\nI did not think why. I did not have a doubt.\n\nIn fact, I’m just a human. I received what life gave me with a biased thought and broken way of thinking.\n\nOr so it seems to be, until now.\n\nA curse to restart life after dying.\n\nA shut-in staying indoor because of distrust in human being. For months and years, piling up useless knowledge and keeping an immature mind.\n\nUsable knowledge? There’s no way~\n\nDon’t look down on a NEET !\n\nI know one thing that’s clear though. \n\nMy life in different world starts now.>"
