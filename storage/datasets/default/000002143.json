Likewise, everyone knows the young master is particular and arrogant, not taken kindly to discipline.\r\n\r\nFeng Shizhen trudged forth despite knowing the dangers, and passing all difficulties, successfully became the Rong family’s private tutor. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, a conspiracy that involved everyone gradually unfolded. \r\nIn this gorgeous world completely different from the outside world, and within the glamorous city filled with brilliant lights and vibrant colors, they tempted, teased, and chased each other; they also loved, betrayed, and hurt…\r\n\r\nJust like two streams of light, lingering and encircling one another, like a never-ending dance. >"
