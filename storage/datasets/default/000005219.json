What is more terrible is to be sold as a rare pet to an extremely large noble cat.\r\n\r\nSince then, Lu Qiu begins to be a pet of a cat.\r\n\r\nThe star network live broadcast platform suddenly adds a lively pet live broadcast. The palm sized human lives in a small house, wears small dress, can organize and cooks, cuts hair, and keeps the master in good order.\r\n\r\nThe audiences watch their pets lying next to them crying and weeping. “Why are other people's pets so good?!”\r\n\r\nWells is lying on the ground lazily enjoying his pet's petting. Why it’s seemed wrong?>"
