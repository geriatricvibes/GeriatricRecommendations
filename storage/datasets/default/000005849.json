	"description": "It was a short moment of happiness to find that I was transferred to world of a game that I had been playing for many years. I had been transferred to Sota Narumi, a villain character who is fat enough to be mistaken for a pig.\n\n　Even though it is a game world where you can enjoy romance in a school full of beautiful men and women, he is called “Butao” and his school life is filled with comtempt from his classmates. If I proceed according to the story as it is progresses, I will be abandoned by my fiancée and childhood friend, and in the end I will be forced to drop out.\n\nI will never give up even in such a dire situation! Eventually I will build a harem and become a top adventurer!\n\n　This is the story of a man who will become unrivalled in both love and dungeons.>"
