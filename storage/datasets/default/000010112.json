	"description": "One day, I woke up from being a poor college student as Princess Roselia Kanep from the novel ‘A Sculpture of Emotion’.\n\nAnd by the way, she was the daughter of a poor noble family who’d squandered their wealth under her brother’s leadership. In order to earn a fortune, she uses the original content of the novel to approach Anoch, the crown prince who lost part of his soul under the curse of a witch.\n\n“Your Highness, I’m an expert in emotions,” she said. And so, he started wondering if she could help him.\n\n“Come on, put feeling into it! Emotions!” Roselia kissed Anoch’s lips.\n\nA side character somehow deviates from the original plot?!>"
