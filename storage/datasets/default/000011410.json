	"description": "After being tossed into another world, Ononogi Kazuto splendidly defeated the Demon King as the Hero. However, there was no sign of being able to return to his old world at all. The moment that he touched a gem that appeared on the Demon King’s throne, Kazuto was sent back to the first town, 《Azerleims》.\n\nFrom here began the tale of this second time(NG+). He saved the imperial princess that he was unable to save in the first iteration, had a wedding with her, and after defeating the Demon King, lived happily ever after. Or at least that’s how it should have been. The True Demon King suddenly appeared.\n\nAlthough it was a tough battle together with his companions, Kazuto eventually defeated it. And from the mouth of the True Demon King appeared a gem. Although he had a bad feeling about it, Kazuto reached his hand out towards it, and when he did, Kazuto was sent once again to the starting town, 《Azerleims》.\n\nAs you’d expect, by now Kazuto wasn’t really surprised, but the figure reflected in the mirror was female. Bewilderment. But at that point, Kazuto took one action.\n\n“… Mn. For now, let’s get naked.”>"
