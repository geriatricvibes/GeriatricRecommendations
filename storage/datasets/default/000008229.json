	"description": "Due to circumstances, Takumi and Nyaachi, who are transferred to another world, are invited by the station master they meet at a station building to live and start working there. After some time passes, they decide to renovate the corner of the station building, and the coffee shop “Swallow” is newly opened for business.\r\n\r\nThe “Swallow” operates on a two-part system, in the morning and in the afternoon. In the mornings, it’s the classic breakfast set, and in the afternoons, there are three kinds of lunch set on the recommended menu.\r\n\r\nTakumi, who is entrusted with the job of the “station master’s representative-cum-store owner” and Nyaachi, the “station’s assistant-cum-poster girl,” will offer their special cinnamon coffee to the customers who drop by the station today.>"
