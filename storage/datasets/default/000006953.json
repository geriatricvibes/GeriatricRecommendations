	"description": "Su Chen inherited a debt that could not be paid back in several lifetimes, and also came with a debt collection system that used lightning strikes every day to remind him to pay.\r\n\r\nHowever, the task was very humane. Influencing the villain wives to understand that the world was full of love.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was the Lord god who saw that he was too pitiful being single and specially saved him?\r\n\r\nIt was just that ... the wives were villains, either perverts or paranoid, either paranoid or inhumane ... this old minister can't do it ah!\r\n\r\nSystem: 100,000-volt package waiting for you!\r\n\r\nVillainess wife: What's a husband? I don't need one! Doesn't revenge taste good? Doesn't it feel good to kill the male and female protagonists? A real woman is a woman who turns the world upside down!\r\n\r\nAfter Su Chen appeared:\r\n\r\nWhy should we follow the husband to the tomb? Come kiss and hug and raise high! >"
