It was still in chaos, and I was already on the verge of dying.\r\n\r\n‘Am I going to die like this…?’\r\n\r\nMy eyes were getting blurry.\r\n\r\nBut then,\r\n\r\n[System Error!]\r\n\r\n[Would$=you like#@to receive the rewards#@(Error!)#@$=?]\r\n\r\n‘A reward at this time? You damn system!’\r\n\r\n[The reward is…]\r\n\r\n‘What?’\r\n\r\nWhat came out of my mouth when I tried to scream was a babble instead.\r\n\r\n“Eubu.”\r\n\r\n[Consciousness has successfully been loaded!]\r\n\r\n[You have been reincarnated! Congratulations!]\r\n\r\n“Agatata!” (Reincarnation, great!)\r\n\r\nHowever, I wasn’t alone this time, because I had a family now.\r\n\r\n‘My father and brothers, why are they so strange?’\r\n\r\n“I have separation anxiety.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t need anything but Risha!”\r\n\r\nAlso, the enemy of my past life suddenly appeared.\r\n\r\n“My savior and benefactor, Princess Anatrisha.”\r\n\r\nI only saved him. Why was he like this?\r\n\r\n‘Will I be able to be happy this time?’>"
