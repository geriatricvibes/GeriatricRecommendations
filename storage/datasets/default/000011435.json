Women are constantly surrounding her and men are getting mercilessly bent in her presence.\r\n\r\nLife motto: As long as the hoe is dancing well, there’s not a single boyfriend she can’t steal!\r\n\r\nZong Jize, king of the city, treats her as his brother but ends up pushing her onto the bed.\r\n\r\nLu Yining says furiously, “Master Zong, I treated you as my brother but instead you sick bastard just wanted to sleep with me!”>"
