	"description": "Xu Mo, a modern high school student was sent back in time to Jing Kingdom and found herself trapped inside of the body of a princess with the same name.\r\n\r\nShe had barely recovered when she learned of an unparalleled fiancé and in a daze, they got married. Then the stunning genius physician who normally does not pay attention clamoured to marry her. After that, there was a cold general, a flirtatious lord, a tsundere young master……\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, this was a male-dominated dynasty. Because the female population was sparse, the entire nation shared wives regardless of rank or nobility. Is it feasible for someone who wants to maintain monogamy in this dynasty?>"
