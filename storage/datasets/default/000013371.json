	"description": "“… Huh, isn’t that Misuno’s voice?”\n\nOne evening, a familiar voice came over the stream that I had randomly selected.\n\nThe voice belonged to a petite but mature, stylish and beautiful, cool-headed junior with a cold demeanor named Misuno Saki.\n\nThat Misuno Saki was live streaming!? What’s more, the stream’s contents were related to love. She’s taking consultations from listeners, and also talking about her own love life… isn’t this totally different from how she normally is!?\n\nOn top of that, I realized that the “senpai she liked” that Misuno was talking about… No matter how I think of it, it has to be me…\n\nA youth romantic comedy where the two of them are brought together by the radio stream!>"
