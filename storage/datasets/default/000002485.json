	"description": "“It is said that when a martial expert reaches the highest state of divinity of their arts, they'd be able to transcend into Celestials, overcoming the limitation of life and death. And as Celestials they have to overcome seven celestial divinities, Genesis, Enlighten, Emotion, Transverse, Seventh Sense, Crisis and Ascend in order to transcend to the Heavens.”\r\n\r\nWhen Jiang Le falls down a cliff, he was not prepared for what is to come and discovered that he had found a secret celestial clan and that the martial fraternity that he had always believe it to be is not what it is!>"
