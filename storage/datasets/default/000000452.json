	"description": "“Oh, Yijie, you’re so pretty, so you should find a wife that’s prettier than you.”\n\nFu Yijie nodded. \n\n“What kind of wife would you want?”\n\n“Someone like my brother.”\n\nIn 4th grade, Fu Kun’s parents wanted to adopt a child. The first time he saw Yijie, Fu Kun thought he was a pretty little girl, but this pretty child who disliked talking became his younger brother just like that. Developing protective instincts for his new introverted, shy brother, Fu Kun ambitiously tried to be a good sibling. But what he did not expect was that his shy brother was, in fact, a two-faced wolf in sheep’s clothing…\n\nTranslator’s Note: The novel title, 竹木狼马 (Zhu Mu Lang Ma, lit. “bamboo, wood, wolves and horses”) is likely a play on the phrase for childhood friends, 青梅竹马 (Qing Mei Zhu Ma, “green plums and bamboo horses”). Since there isn’t a direct translation for this, the title has been left in pinyin.>"
