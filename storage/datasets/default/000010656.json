	"description": "In a listless afternoon within a coffee shop, Yomiya Ruito was nonchalantly skipping college classes. When suddenly he was asked something from the woman who was sharing his table.\n\n「Hey you, come to my world for a bit. I want you to come and destroy it.」\n\nComing from the girl who calls herself god, regarding the weird request that was asked from him in that time’s circumstances, Ruito  found himself unable to decline and was thus invited to another world.>"
