	"description": "I woke up as the daughter of the grand duke in the novel of my favorite character, Raon. This is the move of the divine hand in a fangirl’s life!\r\n\r\nBut why do I have to be Estina, the villainess who bitterly tormented Raon his whole life?!\r\n\r\nRaon is disgusted by the mere presence of Estina.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did not give up and I persistently stalked Raon to be close with him. ”Excuse me, Raon!”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t even say anything yet……”\r\n\r\n“I will literally say ‘No thanks’ to anything you say.”\r\n\r\nHe totally ignored me at first but,\r\n\r\nAt least he is technically talking to me now? I will keep my fangirl spirit alive. Best of luck, me!>"
