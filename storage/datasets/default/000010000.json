	"description": "Akira, my stepbrother, was brought into my life as a high school student after my parents remarried. He is a beautiful boy but shy due to his complicated family environment.\r\nI've always admired my brother, and I've always played with Akira for his sake... He loves me... we hit it off, and the distance between us draws fast!\r\n'...Aniki, do you like me by any chance?' 'Yes, of course.'\r\nThe misunderstanding between the two of us deepens. Until finally, I realized that Akira was my sister, and I was confused...\r\n'I'd rather have the same distance between Aniki and me as before. Though, I'd rather be closer to Aniki than I am now.'\r\nAkira's approach from siblings to lovers has begun!\r\nThis is a love-comedy with a little sister who is too cute and carefree to be a brother!>"
