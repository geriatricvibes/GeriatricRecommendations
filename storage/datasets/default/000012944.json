	"description": "She fell in love with her husband at first sight, whom she’d married out of convenience. One month after the wedding he left for the battlefield, and Evelyn gave birth to their child alone. But what she got in return… was crushing news that her brother had betrayed her husband!\n\nAs a result, her heartless father tried to get her to remarry someone else even before she could sign her marriage papers, but the man she would be married to was a cruel old man who’d murdered four of his wives.\n\nSo Evelyn offered her husband a deal in order for her and her baby to survive…\n\n“I’ll let you sleep… Let’s make a deal.”\n\n“I’m not sure what kind of deal it is, but I’ll accept it, for now.”\n\nIlya is looking for Evelyn to relieve his insomnia—the family’s curse.\n\nEvelyn’s heart still skips a beat whenever she sees Ilya, despite being hurt many many times.\n\nAnd as he spent more time with his wife the feeling of betrayal and hatred faded away…\n\nFinally, spring found him, who lived his life in the frozen winter times.\n\n“You won, Evelyn. Now I don’t care… whether I’m my brother’s replacement or something else.”\n\nThe love story of Ilya and Evelyn unfolds in a passionate narrative.\n\nCan Evelyn indeed run away from a husband who belatedly found love?>"
