	"description": "Ibaraki Maki is a highschool girl who lives in Asakusa and loves the food there above all else.\n\nDespite being only human, she likes to poke her nose into troubles involving ayakashi on a daily basis. Moreover, her go-to method of resolving said trouble often involves using her brute strength.\n\nThis was because she had a secret: she had memories of her previous life.\n\nWhat’s more, those memories weren’t that of a human; they belonged to the oni princess whose name reached far and wide during the Heian period—the infamous Ibaraki-doji.\n\nDragging along Amasake Kaoru, her classmate and reincarnation of her husband in their previous life, Shuten-doji, the strongest oni bride bustles about the streets of Asakusa again today to help the troubled ayakashi!>"
