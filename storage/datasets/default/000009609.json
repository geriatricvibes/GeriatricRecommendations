	"description": "In a zombie apocalypse world, Earth has become a place inhabited by people with twisted heart. In a dog eats dog world, she struggles to survive while witnessing the death of her loved ones until she meets her own gruesome demise.\r\n\r\nThen, she is back, back to the beginning of the end. She grabs that chance. Meet a god, kill a god; Meet Buddha, kill Buddha! Regardless of which methods, she will use everything in order to protect her loved ones!\r\n\r\nHe is gentle like jade, just like his name. His skills are obviously extraordinary, enough to cause the worship of many and earn the loyalty of numerous metahumans. He roamed the lands leading an army with a might that shook the earth.\r\n\r\nIn her previous life, they had never intersected with each other. Yet, in this life, they kept intertwining with each other, was their encounter predestined?\r\n\r\nNo! As Bai Ling said, their relationship is perhaps simply an ill-fated one!>"
