	"description": "Kaoru Nagase was caught up in a mysterious phenomenon and died when returning home from work. It was because of a time-space distortion that a higher life form was cleaning up, but she was able to receive a younger body and the ability to create any potion she wanted in another world!\r\n\r\nKaoru, who’s now a rather sharp-eyed 15 year old girl again, will work hard for a peaceful life in another world!\r\n\r\nEh, as a commoner she doesn’t understand the thinking of nobles? She’s now stuck in a delusional story that she’s trying to escape from?\r\n\r\nHey, this is different from what you told me, goddess!>"
