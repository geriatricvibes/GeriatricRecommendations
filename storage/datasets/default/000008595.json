	"description": "“…I want to slay the stars.”\r\n\r\nJulius, an ordinary villager, had a strange dream on the night of his eighth birthday—he dreamt about the life of a certain swordsman. Hoping to one day slay the twinkling stars in the night sky, the boy simply continued to swing a piece of stick, following in the footsteps of the swordsman who persevered in wielding his sword to the point of foolishness.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, he encounters and fights a monster outside his village, finally awakening a deep, profound feeling inside of him.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a powerless boy who, through hard training and sheer discipline, goes beyond “absurdity” and “recklessness” to make even the impossible become possible.>"
