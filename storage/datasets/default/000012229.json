	"description": "Michael, the most lonely tyrant, only had Leticia who understood him.\r\n\r\nLeticia had been working as his translator for ten years since she was the only one who understood the emperor’s words… until she declared her resignation to live a new life…\r\n\r\nThe tyrant’s condition of spitting out riddled words was strange!\r\n\r\n“Please. Please stay by my side.”\r\n\r\nI was deceived!\r\n\r\n“Why the hell did you do that?”\r\n\r\nMichael slowly opened his mouth in response to Leticia, who couldn’t come to her senses from the shock and betrayal.\r\n\r\n“Because it was the only way to keep you by my side.”>"
