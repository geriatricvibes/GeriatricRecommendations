	"description": "The pink robed mage, who studies the magic of xxoo and runs an adult products store, meets his shy druid stalker. Imagine if the flowers, trees, and small animals around you, who had been stalking you for nine years, turned into a handsome male druid... It's too astonishing...\r\n\r\nTaking the line of fantasy love and a family idol soap opera, this novel will have no seriousness, such as saving the world, or ascending to the heavens, or falling down to the abyss. It's a simple forest, village, stalker, little bureaucrat rural fantasy novel.\r\n>"
