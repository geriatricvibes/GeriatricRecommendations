	"description": "A legendary vampire, a true monster that has even made an enemy of God, a mythical figure from the old stories.\r\n\r\nHe is now an old man who lives as a shut-in in some corner of the Kingdom, in a castle that is closer to a haunted house.\r\n\r\nHe lives a mellow and lazy life - but that peace of his was eventually shattered.\r\n\r\nThis is a quiet era where 'Vampires' only exist in old fables.\r\n\r\nIt is a story of the peaceful every day between a saint who is trying to rehabilitate a shut-in and an old vampire who will not even entertain the thought of going outside.>"
