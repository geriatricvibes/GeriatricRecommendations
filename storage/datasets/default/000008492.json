	"description": "Tired of the schemes and strifes of city life, Bei Feng finally returned to his hometown in the countryside\r\n\r\nWhile picking asters ‘neath the Eastern fence;\r\n\r\nMy gaze upon the Southern mountain rests;\r\n\r\nRearing a few chickens and ducks, I shall lead a simple and leisurely life!\r\n\r\nHowever, who would have thought that fate would play a huge joke on Bei Feng? All kinds of magical items and beings of the Myriad Worlds could actually be fished out of the Ancient Well in his yard!\r\n\r\nEven a chicken reeled out of the well ended up chasing Bei Feng all over the yard and beating him black and blue! Speechless and aggrieved, he asked the Heavens: if, that day, he'd fished out a Dragon instead of a chicken, what would’ve happened to him!>"
