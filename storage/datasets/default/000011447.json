	"description": "Born the eldest son of the Marquess of Grenville, one of the numerous aristocrats of Southern Crane Empire, ‘Hugo’ had a spectacular past…, no life.\n\nEvery time he died, he would always return to the same day when he was fourteen years old. And each time he would be killed by a member of his family.\n\nEven so, he had never been loved by his family since he can remember, and he continued to seek their love and affection.\n\nHe finally realized something at the end of his sixth life. He realised that the love of family is only an illusion.\n\nThus he vowed. If he had to go back to the day when he was 14 years old again, he’ll sever everything.\n\nAnd so, Hugo begins his seventh life. This time, he left his love for his family behind.\n\nTo take his revenge, Hugo sold himself to the Grand Duke of Woodstock, the most powerful family after the Imperial Family.\n\nThere, he met Meltreza, the daughter of a mixed-race human-vampire rumored to be a “monster”.\n\nThis is the story of a man who despaired in six lives and finally finds happiness in his seventh.>"
