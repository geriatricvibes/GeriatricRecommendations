	"description": "Akira Wato, who had a slip of tongue abroad, caused a foreigner’s wrath and unfortunately hit his head and died.\n\n“why!?”\n\nThe word was “fight”, although it was form of encouragement stemming from good intentions. (In japanese)\n\nThe goddess, who was sorry he died, decided to have him reincarnated in another world.\n\nLamenting on the language barrier that caused his death, Akira receives one ability from the goddess.\n\nThat’s “understanding all languages”!\n\nFortunately, Akira is reincarnated as a nobleman, the third son, Jed Clifford.\n\nOne day Jed notices a voice.\n\nIt ’s not a human voice but the voices of animals.\n\nJed, who can talk to joyful animals and even monsters such as goblins and orcs, is involved in every problem.\n\n   “Damn! I understand human words!”\n\n   “Me too! Did we become more intelligent?”\n\n   “Hee yeah! We’re goblin kings, right!?”\n\nSuch a slapstick comedy.>"
