	"description": "The protagonist who's been playing a retro MMORPG in the golden age of VRMMOs was suddenly thrown off to another world. Moreover, he appeared in the dead center of large plains, with nothing but a labyrinth in front. He started creating things in order to survive there along with a girl it kept within.\r\n\r\nBefore long, the protagonist meets with the transmigrators from different games. He gets along with some and fights with others as he spends his time leisurely.>"
