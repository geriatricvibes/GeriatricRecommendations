	"description": "   She was the daughter of the county magistrate but was forced to marry into a peasant family by her dímǔ.\n   She wasn’t from this world. With supernatural powers, a flip of her hand would make clouds form, and a wave of her hand would make rain fall. She was like a fish back in water at her husband’s house, fell in love, and lived a different farm life.\n\nDímǔ: I fully regret it now. If I had known this earlier, I wouldn’t have let her marry!\n\n\n**Dímǔ - Father's Official/Main Wife>"
