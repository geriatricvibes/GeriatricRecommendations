	"description": "The protagonist was a normal high school girl. One day, she was reborn as the villainess marquis’ daughter, Rosalind Stanley, who appeared in an otome game. While living to avoid the tragic fate that meets Rosalind in the game, somehow she raised the heroine’s flags.\r\n\r\n“Kuh… Cute! Such cuteness!? Is this the charm of an otome game heroine!?”\r\n\r\nCould this perhaps be a yuri development!? Even though there was no yuri component in the game!?\r\n\r\nHowever, as the heroine was cute, it couldn’t be helped. The villainess enters the yuri route!\r\n>"
