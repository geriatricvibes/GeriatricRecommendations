At the risk of my life! Quang!”\n\nThe hidden tale of the battle for the throne of the Hernian Empire and the foxy witch who gradually begins to be exposed in front of Riya, who was destined to die due to the development of the script written by the Great Saintess.\n\nThe three princes and shadow of death approaching Riya.\n\nWill Riya Lisburn survive?>"
