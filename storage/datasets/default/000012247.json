	"description": "After finally being admitted to the Department of Exorcism, Dong Zhi’s dream was to grasp both work and love as he strives to pursue an icy male-god, igniting an intense love affair.\n\nA train bound for spring was the beginning of everything. The mountains were solitary, blanketed with snow as smoke from gunpowder dissipated. In the brilliant morning rays, Dong Zhi’s gaze fell on Long Shen’s back. Countless of words he have for him, hidden deep within his eyes.\n\n“To you, whom I love dearly with all my heart, my time in this life, I’ll offer them to you.”>"
