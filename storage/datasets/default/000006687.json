	"description": "Su Jinzhi never died despite being ill for a long time. It came to the point in his life where he believed that he would die this time. However, once he opened his eyes, he didn’t expect that he was kidnapped and tied to a Love Life System.\r\n\r\nThe System told him that it was because he did not give up his love for life even though he was ill to that point. As a result, in this lifetime, he would continue to use his sick figure that was not willing to die to save all those who did not love life in this world. He should rouse their passion to live, encourage them to love life, and teach them to be harmonious with society!\r\n\r\nSu Junzhi: I want to enjoy life first. I will only have the power to save the world after I taste love.\r\n\r\nSystem: Host, please listen to me. You cannot fall in love with this person. You will become damned if you fall in love with this person.\r\n\r\nSu Jinzhi: Isn’t life there to be enjoyed? Why fear death? Shouldn’t becoming a ghost offer you freedom once you die?\r\n\r\n– During the moments I forgot, you loved me.\r\n\r\n– However, during the moments that I remember you, I love you.>"
