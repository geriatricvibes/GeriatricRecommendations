	"description": "On my third year of being a fangirl to the male protagonist.\r\n\r\nI was caught by the tyrant Duke Hades Louvremont, who was a fool for his son.\r\n\r\n'Constantly following me, offering expensive gifts, and even desperate enough to go all the way to the north regardless of the dangers in here...'\r\n\r\n'I'm very sorry. I have nothing more to say.'\r\n\r\n'Alright, I concede. I can't pretend to be oblivious anymore.'\r\n\r\n'...As expected, I'm your ideal man, aren't I? I don't think I've ever witnessed such devotion.'\r\n\r\n'Many women have long been pursuing me, but I've never seen anyone as persistent as you. It's rather fascinating. Of course, we can proceed with the marriage as soon as possible.'\r\n\r\n'Hah...?'\r\n\r\n'By all means, I'll do it.'\r\n\r\n'I-I'm sorry, what?! What did you say?'\r\n\r\n...What did he mean by that?\r\n\r\nI must've heard that wrong, right?\r\n\r\nYet the duke let out a bloody smile at my blank face and gave me a proper confirmation.\r\n\r\n'I said I'll do it. I'll marry you.'\r\n\r\nOh my god.\r\n\r\nThe hero's father is extremely narcissistic!>"
