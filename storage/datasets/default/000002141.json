	"description": "Because of her timid personality in her previous life, she couldnâ€™t say what she wanted and held it in, thus, she died because of a single vase.\n\nShe was born again, but she became a saint even though she was from a small family because she was a noble person.\n\nA saint or whatever.\n\nFrom now on, I will live as I want!\n\nBut as I lived my life saying what I wanted to say, my reputation was getting higher and higher.>"
