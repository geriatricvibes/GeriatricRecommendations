	"description": "Kajikawa Hikaru, 25 year old, spends my days working overtimes with no particular goals.\r\nTook a nap on my car and found myself in a forest when I got up.\r\nTried to look for help, a monster showed up instead, eh what, that's spooky.\r\nAfter somehow managing to deal with it (almost mutual destruction), I'm convinced this is another world, but then after checking it up, I got no skill even small fry supposedly have, with all zero stats. No way man.\r\nBut thanks to the gradually evolving game-like menu screen and practical usage of mana control above even skills, I'm doing good so far. Or rather, it seems like I'm slowly getting stronger beyond common sense. Wait, do I even need skills again? It's pretty much Cheat level already?\r\nMy companions is also getting stronger beyond belief following me, makes living here surprisingly easy. Or rather, they're getting awfully scary now.\r\nFor now my goal is to take a trip around the world, eat good food and beat up those trying to mess with us, be it demon lord vassals, no mercy.\r\nThis is one such story.>"
