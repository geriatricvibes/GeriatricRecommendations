	"description": "I was run over by a truck and died, so for some reason I decided to decide which race to reincarnate via roulette.\r\n\r\nThat’s how I chose…a virus!?\r\nSeen off by a beautiful, easygoing goddess, I was sent to another world.\r\n\r\n“As expected, a virus is too meaningless. There were dragons and the like among different races…”\r\n\r\nI was depressed, but I soon noticed the cheat ability.\r\n\r\nFree possession.\r\nCopy skills that you can get every time you are infected.\r\nAn almost infinite stock of life.\r\nWeakening the enemy to self-modify.\r\n\r\nHaving become an immortal virus, I decided to enjoy a new life in a different world.>"
