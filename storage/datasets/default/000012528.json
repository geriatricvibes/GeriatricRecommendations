	"description": "Because his family wanted connections through marriage, Lin Zhishui, an 18th tier star, was “forced” to marry He Yan, the male god who he had been secretly in love with for many years.\r\n\r\nOn the wedding day, He Yan had the post-nuptial contract in hand and with a headache, looked at the kid who was seven years younger than him. When the kid looked at him, his eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\nLin Zhishui widened his eyes full of tears and asked in a low voice——He-dage…can we….not sleep in separate rooms? I’m scared of the dark…\r\n\r\nLater, Lin Zhishui, who was said to be afraid of the dark, participated in a wilderness reality show. At night, out of the five charming little stars there, only he dared to go out at night to find supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the night after the program was broadcast, He Yan hugged him and whispered in his ear——Kid, you have to be punished for lying.>"
