	"description": "Zhou Qingfeng is a nerd with no car, no savings, and no girlfriend. This story is set three days before the occurrence of a cataclysm that would threaten all of humankind. Amidst the chaos, Zhou Qingfeng strives to gather resources that would help him survive. He will stop at nothing to protect his friends. Along the way, he is granted a few ‘special’ abilities. He becomes so strong that he is practically invincible. But, everything comes with a price….\r\n\r\nFaced with new enemies each day, how far will Zhou Qingfeng’s determination to survive take him?!\r\n\r\n'I start the game, with a dog in my hand. The equipment I need, I gather along the way.\r\n\r\nI dive into the cataclysm with the status of a beginner.\r\n\r\nRuthless, I shall become. I would even detonate a bomb over my head!\r\n\r\nThis is the path that I have to take, to rise to be the King of the Wasteland. '>"
