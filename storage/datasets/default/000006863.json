	"description": "When that black bellied and domineering King Hades meets the reckless and bold orphan girl! Before people, he spoils her to the extent that everyone is jealous of. And behind people, he still spoils her, but in a different away. He ‘spoils’ her till she has a back pain, till she can’t feel her limbs, till she can only rest in bed for three days! Ruan Jiujiu yells to heaven: Asshole! Have you married a wife or hired a nanny? Do you have Oedipus complex?>"
