	"description": "The Witches of Africa A group of soldiers from Karlsland, Romagna and Britannia lead by Major Bach is defending the pass against a overwhelming force of Neuroi until reinforcements in form of Major Miles, her Tank Witch squadron and Marseille arrive. Tiger in the Desert The second doujinshi centers around a group of Karlslander soldiers and the development of the Tiger unit under the command of Friederike Porsche. Due to the war ridden state of Karlsland, they are looking for additional funding from other allied Nations, therefore General Patton pays a short visit at the beginning. The Stuka Witch Marseille, calling herself Scheherazade of North Africa, tells a tale of Karlslander Witch (Friederike) who left the skies to get her man (Schmitt), though it is somewhat dramatized according to Friederike herself.>"
