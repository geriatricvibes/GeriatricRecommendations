Min Hui didn’t say a word about herself, but Li Chunmiao, who was curious, immediately sensed what was on her mind and sacrificed her life to save her. In order to make up for the debt in her heart, Min Hui decides to replace Li Chunmiao to see Xin Qi, but unexpectedly falls into an embarrassing relationship. She decided to fulfill Li Chunmiao’s wish no matter what, but the price was a brand new life.>"
