	"description": "Feng Lingxi was the traditional family's head mistress - a person with a charismatic yet sly personality with the ability to attract people easily to her side, and having the potential to take someone's soul away. Crossing across boundaries from a decade ago to now, a world that gives woman full respect and acknowledgement....\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by her, because she was someone who would act obediently in front of a crowd but, stabs them in the back when necessary! Disguising as someone that would gain her trust and belief! That was why the Emperor of Xian started doting on her, allowing her to become absurdly daring to do whatever she liked.
