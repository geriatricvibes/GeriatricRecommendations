	"description": "After graduating, Shen NingXin became an intern at a company. The atmosphere in the company was nice, the work was relaxing, her coworkers all took care of her, except for her iceberg of a boss, who had a dark face all day and was devoid of any human feelings.\n\n“This plan is unacceptable. Change it again.”\n\n“What’s the matter with this form? How many times have I told you before?”\n\n“If you can’t finish it today, don’t think about leaving tonight.”\n\nShen NingXin felt as though she must’ve committed a great sin in her last life to have such an unlovable boss in this one.\n\nUntil one day . . . she stumbled upon her boss’ Weibo alt account.\n\n—After work today, nobody invited me for the group dinner. I’m so sad.\n\n—Xiao Zhang went on a vacation and secretly brought back souvenirs for everybody, but there was nothing for me. I saw it all. QAQ\n\n—Shen NingXin hasn’t talked to me the entire day. Did I make her hate me by scolding her too harshly yesterday . . .\n\nIf it weren’t for seeing the pictures in the photo album, Shen NingXin would’ve never believed that this was actually her boss.\n\nIt turned out that the iceberg was really a crybaby all along.\n\nWhat was even more unexpected was that she was topped by such a crybaby and . . . couldn’t resist it.>"
