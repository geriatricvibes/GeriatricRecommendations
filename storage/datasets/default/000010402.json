	"description": "The praised Saint Julia. \r\n\r\nBut when she became a saint, nothing good came out of it. \r\n\r\nA harsh working environment, and not even a young man of her taste! I would rather have demons appear and kidnap me. If possible, a handsome demon. \r\n\r\nThen one day, Heath, the demon king who was sealed a hundred years ago, attacks the temple. The opportunity is now. \r\n\r\nJulia pretends she's been kidnapped by the Demon King, and decides to run away from the temple. \r\n\r\nAnd having sex with the handsome Demon King is a bonus! \r\n\r\n“I will take responsibility.” \r\n\r\n'Eh?' \r\n\r\nBut after a satisfying time, Heath brings out his unexpected words. \r\n\r\n“Let’s get married, Julia.” \r\n\r\n'......Huh?' \r\n\r\nWill Julia be able to enjoy a leisurely runaway life as she wants? \r\n>"
