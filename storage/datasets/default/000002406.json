	"description": "Kang Xing Luo was a responsible and diligent pet owner (aka the official in charge of cleaning poop). One morning, he was in a car accident, that left him in a coma. When he woke up 2 years later, he entered a new era of mixed species.\n\nThe genes of various sorts of house pets were triggered. Not only did they incarnate into evolutionary species with high IQ and physical capability, but they also had the ability to take on human form.\n\nWith the labels #no house no car no work no savings#, #been in a coma for two years# #isolated from society#, Kang Xing Luo struggled in his new life. The cat master that he had come across by chance in the past (the cat is the “master”, the pet owner is their “servant”), the super big shot of today stepped forward.\n\n“I’ll raise [him].”\n\nKang Xing Luo was deeply moved, then the voices of the second and third one came to him:\n\n“You? Who needs you to raise him?”\n\n“I’ll raise him, thank you.”\n\nIn the chaos of everyone fighting over raising him, Kang Xing Luo suddenly remembered. Back then, he was addicted to doting on cats; he carried the little cuties that he met home one after another.\n\nHe didn’t raise a lot of them…… just 6.>"
