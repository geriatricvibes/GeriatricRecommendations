	"description": "“I was able to miraculously regress at the brink of death, but that’s not the problem right now.\r\n\r\n[Guardian Deity ‘Sung Hyun-sook’ sends sponsorship package to ‘My son ♡’!]\r\n\r\n[Package list: (Korean) Breakfast Package]\r\n\r\n“M-mom?”\r\n\r\nMy mom who passed away long ago became my Guardian Deity”\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle note: The literal translation of this novel’s title is actually “My Mom is my Constellation” and the word constellation is used in Korean novels where the main character, usually in an online game setting receives support, or/and is controlled by an unknown/known, real or spiritual being. I just felt like the term Guardian Deity would fit better in this case from an English reader’s point of view. >"
