	"description": "In the spring of my sophomore year of high school, I was suddenly hired as a tutor by a first-year junior.\r\nShe lived alone and I was assigned to teach her how to study at her house. ...She started messing around with me in some way.\r\nShe would press her body against mine, and she would want to study on my lap.\r\nTo top it off, she said she'd work harder for another hour if I kissed her...\r\n\r\n'Senpai, can I come a little closer?'\r\n'Senpai. Can't we hold hands?'\r\n'I'll have you take a bath with me.'\r\n\r\nShe was always bewitching and a little naughty. This was a love comedy of a tutor under one roof, woven with such a cute little devilish junior!>"
