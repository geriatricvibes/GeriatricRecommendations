	"description": "'I will break the engagement with you!'\r\n\r\nThe story that started with exilement of the villainess, turned into a chaos due to the zombie panic outbreak.\r\n\r\nBut the villainess did not panic.\r\nBecause she had received the highest level of education「just in case」anything like this happened.\r\n\r\n'Did you know? the trained sword techniques won't betray you!'\r\n\r\nThe Prince? he'll die right away so there's no need to worry.\r\n>"
