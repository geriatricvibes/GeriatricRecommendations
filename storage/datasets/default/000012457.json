	"description": "“Stiana, hurry and help Eileen right now. Come on. Come on!”\n\nInstead of me, whose face was black and blood was pouring out from an impaled sword, he shouted for his love who’s blood had only splattered.\n\nI’m sorry, Your Highness the Prince. You should ask someone else to do that.\n\nI died on his behalf while living as his knight commander.\n\nIt was sad that I didn’t have any good memories closing my eyes.\n\nBut the good thing about such a life was that there were no lingering feelings.\n\nI’m sure I did, but…\n\n***\n\nWhat are these burdensome people around me?\n\nI don’t think ordinary people have a golden crown atop their head.\n\nAre the little ones barely sticking out half the head from either side of the bed the cause?\n\n“Stiana. You brought victory to the Empire. My lovely Princess. I’ll take over one kingdom on the Continent for each of your birthdays.”\n\n“Hueng…”\n\nNow I know the identity of this sense of discomfort.\n\nOh, my. I guess I’m a baby!>"
