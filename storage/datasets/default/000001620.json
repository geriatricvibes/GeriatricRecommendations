	"description": "I got the weakest skill Tamer from God. Because my life is in danger, I decided to leave the village and go on a journey!\n\nWhile on a journey I discover a monster that can be tamed! It’s just a weak slime, that can die with only a poke. Various things are scattered on the ground along the way. When I picked it up, it became something amazing.\n\nI’ll turn my life around and find a place to live peacefully!>"
