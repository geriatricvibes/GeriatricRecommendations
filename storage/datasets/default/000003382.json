	"description": "When she woke up, Nuonuo became a seventeen-year-old little escaped wife of a paranoid man in the book.\n\nThe male character was cold and indifferent.\n\nThe college entrance examination countdown calendar in her classroom showed two hundred days. She lowered her eyes and studied for the exam.\n\nUnder all circumstances, she just wanted to take the college entrance exam and leave him!\n\nHowever, it took a long time for Nuonuo to understand the truth.\n\nPeople who are loved by such paranoid men can never run.\n\nRun? You can’t run away in this life.>"
