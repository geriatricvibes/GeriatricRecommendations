	"description": "The story unfolds in another 'possible' modern age. The main characters are youngsters called 'Kildren', who are destined to live eternally in their adolescence. The Kildren are conscious that every day could be the last, because they fight a 'war as entertainment' organized and operated by adults. But as they embrace the reality they are faced with, they live their day-to-day lives to the full.>"
