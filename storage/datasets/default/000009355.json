And I don't have any money..\r\nIf that's the case, I gotta work hard at a part-time job again, like before! \r\n\r\nA normal person that returned from another world does a part-time job, eats food, sometimes runs into trouble, has close calls with the police, and ends up helping some people...Is what was supposed to have happened. \r\n\r\nA written record of a normal life that begins to deviate little by little, a person who himself wants to spend it leisurely in a normal manner, and the surroundings that inevitably start moving in a changing world.>"
