	"description": "It was already her eighth suicide attempt.\n\nEmpress Medea did not die again this time, but this time it was a little strange.\n\n“Memory loss?”\n\nEmperor Lyle was amused with Medea’s words.\n\n'You’ve been tormenting me terribly this whole time, and now you’ve lost your memory?'\n\nEven if I had postponed it, the appointed night of union came back every two weeks. It was useless.\n\nI didn’t even want to give it to you.\n\nBut if there was anything Lyle overlooked, it was that there really was another kernel in the shell.\n\nNamely, Oh Soo-yeon, an ordinary Korean office worker.\n\nAbsurdly, she died from drinking too much and entered the novel.\n\nMedea was an extra dying in the very beginning.\n\nSo what happened to the heroine Seira?\n\nOriginally, she should have gotten together with Lyle.\n\nThe couple’s night came amidst confusion.\n\nFor some reason, the mysterious fragrance of Medea stimulated Lyle’s heart.\n\n“Your lips can’t be this sweet…”\n\nAs of that day, His Majesty’s annoying obsession began.\n\nWas it really okay like this?>"
