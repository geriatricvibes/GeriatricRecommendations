Can I sit here?”\n\nSasaki Kento, a third-year college student who is always studying alone, meets Ito Natsuki, a beautiful woman who appears in the seat next to him. — Then, with Natsuki’s presence, Kento’s life gradually begins to change colors. \n\n“Have you thought about indirect kissing?” “Give me your contact information.” “I’d like to stay over this time.” “I want to be friends with Kento…..”\n\nNatsuki continues to approach Kento, who is awkward with women for some reason. Slowly but surely, the gap between them narrows—this is the story of a young boy who is clumsy and reluctant to show his kindness, and a beautiful woman who discovers his hidden kindness.>"
