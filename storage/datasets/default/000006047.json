	"description": "The greatest nation on the continent was the Kingdom of Terrosa.\n\nSouls were the beings that were discriminated against the regular folk of the kingdom.\n\nLesaric, who was the strongest Soul, fulfilled his responsibility as the chief commander and led the final battle to victory. He was then sentenced to death by the king.\n\nHe would have welcomed death if he had not been saved by the fourth princess, the most powerless member of the royal family.\n\n“Why did you save me?” Lesaric had asked.\n\nDelmore had shrugged. “I thought it would be unfair if you died that way.” She was vastly different from the other royals who lived terrible and corrupt lives.\n\nLesaric knew that she, being the director of the laboratory, was planning something dangerous without the knowledge of anyone else. He also knew that each time he saw Delmore’s beautiful green eyes, he felt something for her, something entirely new.\n\n“Use me,” he had told her. “I’m pretty useful when you need me to be.”\n\nDelmore had smiled.\n\nAnd there they were, the princess who longed for something greater and the knight that would let it all go for her. The two of them, together.>"
