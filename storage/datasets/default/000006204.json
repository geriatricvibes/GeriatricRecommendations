Could you please take a walk with me?”\r\n“Mother, I baked cookies myself. Try a bite.”\r\n“Mother, mother….”\r\n\r\nMy young daughter-in-law always follows me around, leaving behind the boy who will become her future husband?\r\n\r\n“Mom, I like Lily, but I like you better.”\r\n\r\nMy son, who was scared of me, whispered with a shy face.\r\n\r\n“Madam, how long are we going to use separate rooms?”\r\n\r\nMy husband, who was always cold, looked at me with honey dripping eyes.\r\n\r\n……Why is everyone acting towards me in such a way all of a sudden?>"
