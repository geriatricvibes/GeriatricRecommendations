	"description": "One day, Senelia realized that the world she lived in was a novel.\n\nAs a result, she fell into the trap of the tyrant emperor Cliff and had to make Benelucia, the male lead in the novel, love her.\n\nSo Senelia wandered around him for a year without saying a word, followed him for another year, and dated him for six years.\n\nEven if he met the original female lead, Senelia would appear in his mind.\n\nSenelia devoted eight years of her time to Benelucia for that purpose.\n\nWithout that much effort, she wouldn’t be able to steal the male lead from the original female lead.\n\n“You should marry me, Sally.”\n\nEight years passed by.\n\nFinally, the male lead started obsessing over her.>"
