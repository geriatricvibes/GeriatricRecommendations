	"description": "More than twenty years ago, two clones were made from excellent organs. Yet, the same physical parts made two very different beings, one being evil and one moral. Human cloning became a battle between ethical integrity and research progress. The Bai Bio-Research Group, an overnight success, battled the secret island-based Bio-Research Base. For two decades, the conspiracies never stopped, and the brutal live-human experiments continued, with Silver Warriors and pirates participating in the rivalry. As secrets were revealed, human nature was tested to the extreme.>"
