	"description": "Ducnoir, also known as Black Duke, was a title granted to those surgeons and physicians after passing the rigorous assessments from the Nationale des Grands Médecins. The names of the Black Dukes who had ever existed were recorded in The Asclepius List, as they gained certain privileges in society. Besides, they received nearly unlimited funding and resources from the country to support their research.\n\nWith the fate of humanity in the palm of their hands, these doctors pursued the greatest knowledge of medicine, and they were all skilled and talented to help those in need and save lives during the suffering of horrific plagues. They risked and even sacrificed their own lives to fulfil their duties. These unsung heroes had no fear of death – they are the Black Dukes!>"
