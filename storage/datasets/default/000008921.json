	"description": "As someone who died because of overwork in some super black company, before I knew it, I already reincarnated as a baby named 『Sefiria』 in a world of sword and magic.\n\n….. But, having been born in a poor village with no ability, God…. what are you trying to do?\n\nAs someone who’s forsaken by heaven, I’ve found some hope ——- that is the shocking truth about 「Magic Formula」 and 「Programming language」 resembling each other .\n\nThis is it, my story about crawling up from the depth of the abyss of 『Absolutely don’t want to work』\n\nNote: The protagonist is born as a boy in WN version and a girl in the LN version.>"
