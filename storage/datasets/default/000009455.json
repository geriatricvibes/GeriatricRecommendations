	"description": "How sharp can the famous General Yan Changqing’s sword be?\n\nWith a wave of his hand, he could split the hardest armour and cut a hair off with the smallest blow.\n\nWith force, he could chop off the enemy’s head cleanly.\n\nIn a rage, even without effort, the blade would have already cut through the other party’s clothes and pierced through their flesh and blood until it couldn’t pierce through anymore.\n\nFingertips trembling slightly, the silver sword landed. Immediately afterwards, Yan Changqing was strongly pressed into the corner.\n\nThere was nowhere to escape.\n\n“Baby, now you have two choices.”\n\nHelian Rongchuan pressed down on Yan Changqing’s struggling arm.\n\nHe bowed his head and kissed him domineeringly, yet gently.\n\n“Kill me, or be mine.”>"
