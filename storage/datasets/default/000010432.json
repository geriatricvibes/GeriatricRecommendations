	"description": "On her seventh birthday, Lilia, the daughter of a Duke, remembers something terrible. She’s been reincarnated as a villainess in an otome game. In the game, she was a queen candidate that abused her power, but in the end—after all her wrongdoings were exposed—she was condemned.\r\n\r\nI want to break this death flag somehow!\r\n\r\nShe insists on getting engaged to Clark, the son of a frontier count before she’s betrothed to the first prince. But what she didn’t realize is that Clark was a potential capture target…a tsundere who has grown up to be a splendid yandere.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Lilia—who believes that this world is an otome game—and Clark, who tries to fulfill her wishes.>"
