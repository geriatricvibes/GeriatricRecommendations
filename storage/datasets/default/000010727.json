	"description": "Someone had used Gu Feining, a nobody in the entertainment circle, to increase their popularity. The other party was a popular young actor. He was good-looking, rich, and even had a mesmerizing V-line. Don’t ask her how she knows! \n\nWhen the man grabbed her hand and pressed it against his well-defined abs, all she wanted to say was: It’s fine if you use me to increase your popularity, must you try to get close to me too? \n\nThroughout the five years since he debuted, Shi Xi was a very well-known 'straight guy' (hopelessly dense in romantic endeavors) in the entertainment circle. His fans say he might even stay single until he was ninety with that kind of ability.\n\nHowever, he tagged Gu Feining on Weibo one day, blatantly asking for her contact number. It was like he had carved the words ‘please date me’ on his face. \n\nThe fans: “Handsome, please stay still. We’ll help you chase this beautiful woman.” \n\nGu Feining: “Hey, can you control the comments on Weibo?” \n\nShi Xi: “Alright, when will you kiss me?” \n\nGu Feining: … The idol you guys thought would be single forever, with his courting ability, is actually someone who’s great at saying mushy romantic lines when it comes to pursuing someone he likes!>"
