My daughter is now a high school student and gets along pretty well with her childhood friend, Takumi Aterazawa. Maybe they’ll start dating soon? Ta-kun is a very nice boy and I’m rooting for him. Huh? “Please, give me your daughter” is what you want to tell me? Oh, gosh, you’re so formal-\n\n“Ayako-san, I’ve been in love with you for a long time. Please, go out with me.”\n\n“…You like me, not my daughter?!\n\nA woman that raised her sister’s daughter and a boy that was in love with her. This is the start of a romantic comedy of an extremely pure love in which pent up feelings will explode after years!>"
