	"description": "In the early days of my debut as an idol, due to my pretty face, I had to play the role of a ‘bottom’ in the coupling fans had pushed.\r\n\r\nBut because I resented such an image, I attempted to change it by growing out a beard, tanning, and even packing on muscles.\r\n\r\nAs a result of my transformation, an irreversible loss of fandom began…\r\n\r\nShocked by my appearance from cute to muscular, fans stopped their fanaticism one by one, and as if on queue, other members of our group, U-PITE, acted similarly foolish one after another as the group broke down.\r\n\r\nFive years later, I spend my days in regret having not accepted my role as a ‘bottom’ and wishing if I could go back to the past, I would be exactly what fans had wanted me to be.\r\n\r\nThen one day, as I had wished, I inexplicably returned to my early debut days…\r\n\r\nNow all I wished for was happiness! As such, I had vowed to become the ‘bottom’ of U-PITE in earnest and walk only on the path of success.\r\n\r\nHowever, a problem had arisen. The other members seemed to have fallen for my ‘bottom’ act.>"
