	"description": "“Dirty wench! You stole my necklace!”\n\n“Unless I knew where your necklace was, I wouldn’t have been able to take it.”\n\nAs an illegitimate child, Laritte’s biggest sin was being born.\n\nIn the year she became an adult, she was sent to marry the ghost duke who was rumored to be dead. Her miserable life seemed to get worse and worse, however…\n\nHer life changed when the duke came back alive.\n\n“Madam, how do you like it?”\n\nKind servants,\n\n“You have enough luxury to buy some residences in the capital.”\n\n“…no one will be able to look down on you anymore.”\n\nAnd the empire’s devoted and murderous duke.\n\nIt was already too late for those who tormented Laritte to regret it.>"
