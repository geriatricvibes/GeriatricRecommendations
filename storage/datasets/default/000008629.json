	"description": "She is the world’s most famous evil doctor.\n\nThe silver needle in one hand is superb, it is not only a tool to save people, but also a weapon to kill.\n\nWhen she wakes up again after being victimized by a conspiracy, she is no longer her.\n\n“Let’s divorce!” The man mercilessly threw the divorce papers at her.\n\nShe took it and smiled coldly, because at this moment Xia Yanxuan no longer exists, inside her is a ghost, her name is Liu Qinxi.\n\nShe thought that she was just a woman abandoned by her husband.\n\nBut when an odd necklace identical to the one she owns in her previous life that possesses supernatural powers appears.\n\nWaves of powerful and mysterious forces keep coming to her.\n\nEverything seems to have become less calm.\n\nThere’s a saying that if you do not become great in adversity, you will die in adversity.\n\nPeople with little insight know that it is better to offend the villain than provoke an evil doctor.\n\nIn response, she just smiled coldly.\n\nThose who insulted me will die mercilessly. I will not hesitate to break their bones!\n\nBut, but –\n\nThe more powerful she is, the more men chase behind her.>"
