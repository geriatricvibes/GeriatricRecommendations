	"description": "[Hello, host, I am the 'heart of loyal servant' system from the three thousand world, numbered A007.]\r\n\r\n'Hello, A007. My name is Mei Lu, a maid.'\r\n\r\n[The host is the one I found in the three thousand worlds that best meets the conditions of this system. As long as you complete the tasks assigned to you by the clients through the system and earn enough energy, in return, the system will realize any of your wishes. Would you like to bind with me?]\r\n\r\n'Bound to you, can you help me find the owner?'\r\n\r\n[Of course. As long as there is enough energy, all demands of the host can be realized.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
