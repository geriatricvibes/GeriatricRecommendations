	"description": "I was the red daughter of the great countess, and lived an admirable life as the most beautiful woman in the empire. I thought I got terminally ill, yet when I woke up again I had become a commoner maid serving a mansion. The mansion that’s my own house.\n\n‘What the hell is going on here?\n\nMy parents were dead and I was an illegitimate child born from my mother’s affair, not only that I had worked as a maid for 8 years?\n\nIs this some kind of parallel world?\n...Maybe I had possessed my own body in a parallel world of some kind\n\nIn this world, it was a plan by my uncle to steal her title that dishonored and persecuted Neria \n\n“Wake up. You are not a Valentis, and this place isn’t your home”\nI have decided that I would bring back everything that had been taken away from me.\n\nYou better be prepared, \n‘Cause I am not the Neria Valentis you used to know!’\n\nNeria’s mission for self-rescue, \nSalvation is achieved by oneself!>"
