	"description": "“I heard you have a fiancé? Do you love him?”\r\n\r\nOne day, Daniel comes to Iveka, who has lost her memories of working for the Bureau of Judicial Affairs, and arrives with an unexpected offer: marriage.\r\n\r\n“You must be busy, but it’s a simple matter of business. How about marrying me?”\r\n“Excuse me? Of all women, why me…?”\r\n“Of course, you can refuse if you don’t want to do it. You might not even like the queen’s position.”\r\n\r\nHowever, it won’t be like a fairy tale. He had not fallen in love with her at first sight. It was a proposal unlike any other, and a sudden fate as a queen. Will she be nothing more than just a queen to be taken advantage of?\r\n\r\nThe reason for this wedding is yet to unfold.>"
