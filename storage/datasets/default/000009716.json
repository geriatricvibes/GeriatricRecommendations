	"description": "‘I was sad just for being reincarnated with a dirt spoon, and now you're telling me I also have to marry because of a debt?’\n\nNot just that, but the person who will be my husband is the Heir Apparent of Duke Hessenweitz, the monster from all those horrifying rumors!\n\n“A monster doesn’t deserve good treatment.”\n\nHowever, in the castle of the duke, I saw my young husband being abused for being a monster. I felt pity for my young husband and since he was more like a younger brother to me, I tried to be a little nicer to him…\n\n“You are my miracle and my salvation.”\n\nOnly… I didn’t expect this kind of reaction at all?\n\nAnd not just that...\n\n“If I had a daughter who resembles my wife, she would be like you!”\n\nNo, why are you doing this to me? Even the father-in-law who had a bad temper?\n\nCan I survive this duke’s castle safely?>"
