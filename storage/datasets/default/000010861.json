	"description": "Serienne was a commoner maid who worked under Count Tremain. One day, her lost memories of the past 10 years flooded back to her. \n\nHer original name was Ashella de Ach. She was not a commoner, but a lady of the prestigious de Ach duchy, a household framed for an incident she barely escaped death from.\n\nAfter recalling her memories, she vowed to find her family and return to her beloved husband, the emperor of the empire, Lahadelt…\n\n“If you want to live, don’t say a word or even take a breath that I can hear.” \n\nHowever, he became a crazy tyrant feared by the entire empire.\n\nHe was definitely the cute scaredy-cat she had loved, so what in the world happened in the last 10 years? \n\n“There’s a rumor that the emperor lost his lover and went crazy.” \n\nThere’s no way that’s because of me, right?>"
