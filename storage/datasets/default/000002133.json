	"description": "The genius pharmacist transmigrated into a pitiful farm girl’s body. Ignored by her own father, abused by her stepmother, and bullied by her stepbrothers. Her “twin” brother was given to distant relative and she went as the “extra” to live under someone else’s roof.\n\nLuckily, she possessed incredible apothecary skills. Collecting herbs, plowing herb fields, formulating medicines and treating the ills, she refused to  live an ordinary life as she slowly uncovered the truth of her real identify.\n\nInadvertently, she saved a dashing man who was in reality a big, bad wolf hiding under the skin of an innocent little puppy. He pulled out all his tricks: I have no other means to return your favor of saving my life. How about I repay you by marrying you?>"
