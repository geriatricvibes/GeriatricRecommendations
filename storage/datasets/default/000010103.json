	"description": "The otome game world's villainess Millene's past life was a Japanese high school girl. When she was young, she was a naughty kid, and now when she met the sparkling 17-year-old Prince Rendor, her memories returned, but the 15-year-old animal lover Millene once again had her heart stolen by him, while seemingly sticky and full of misundertandings, she's trying her best to have a happy marriage, that kind of exciting and fairly sweet story.>"
