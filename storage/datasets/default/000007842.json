	"description": "Luo Shaoheng could never have imagined that the man he rescued in an alleyway that night would change his life forever. He was the one he had been searching for his entire life – his soulmate.\r\n\r\nWith him, he experienced the sweetest love, yet he also experienced the irrevocable pain of separation through death…\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, the lover he had thought had perished in that car crash ten years ago appeared in front of him once again. However, he had no memory of him nor the time they spent together…\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter. I’ll use this chance to make you fall in love with me anew.”>"
