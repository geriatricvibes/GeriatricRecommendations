	"description": "As a walking bug, Bai Tu will always extend a friendly hand towards vicious supporting characters and villains.\r\n\r\nThe supporting characters and villains were shivering in the corner. The heroine said she wanted to be good friends with us, but she turned her face and didn't recognize anyone in a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nBai Tu: 'Who agreed with you?' \r\n\r\nThe male god walked by with a kind smile on his face: 'I heard that you want to be friends with her?' \r\n\r\nEveryone: 'No, we don't want to.' \r\n\r\nMale God: 'She is mine! Mine alone! No one is allowed to take her away.'>"
