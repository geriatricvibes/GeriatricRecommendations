	"description": "“I was given a building as an inheritance?”\r\n\r\nFrom a nobody who does all kinds of odd jobs and lived a hard life, he was given a chance to become a landlord right in the middle of Gangnam!\r\n\r\nBut, the condition for this inheritance is to ‘operate a restaurant for 5 years.’\r\n\r\n‘Moreover, I can sense a chill down my spine thanks to the weird customers that came in for today’s store opening……Do I really just need to prepare food?’\r\n\r\n“So then...all the guests who came in yesterday…”\r\n\r\n“They were ghosts.”\r\n\r\nEvery night starting from 11 o’ clock until 1 o’clock, we will now be open!>"
