	"description": "“Welcome to a world of endless warfare.\n\n“You’re a blade. It’s your destiny to kill and conquer for God.\n\n“You must win every battle. Regardless of whether you’re a defender or trailblazer; whether you’re an impassive weapon or impassioned ammunition; whether your identity is a commander, soldier, or prisoner.\n\n“Remember that your merit is his merit, and your glory is his glory.\n\n“Victory or defeat, fresh flowers or a tombstone, you only have one end.\n\n“Walk through that door, and you are war incarnate.”\n\n“No.” He said, “I am victory.”\n\n–\n\nHe stood before the door. “One last question.”\n\n“Please, ask.”\n\n“How will he reward me?”\n\n“…”>"
