	"description": "Horus, the fifth prince of the Magref Empire, is considered useless because he can only use the magic of the sand attribute to manipulate the sand, and is banished from the empire.\n\nThrown into the scorching desert, Horus demonstrates his sand magic and builds a huge sand castle.\n\nRealizing that what seemed to be hell for others was heaven for him, he decided to live here leisurely.\n\nHowever, through the battle with the demons, friends of various races gather and gradually form a “kingdom” with Horus as the king.>"
