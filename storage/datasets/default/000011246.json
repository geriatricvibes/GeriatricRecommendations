When he checked his status, he found that he possessed a unique ability called Perseverance Makes One Stronger, an ability that could make him stronger the more he put in effort. Not rewarded even if he put in effort in his previous life, the youth rejoiced as effort wouldn’t fail him in this life!\n\nAnd in this life, he was happily spending time with his cute fiance, Lily, and his childhood friend and blacksmith’s daughter, Mayle. However, an evil clutch is approaching and—\n\nThe story of a youth who could infinitely grow through making effort starts now!>"
