	"description": "Ye Muxi opened her eyes and found that she slept with a man. She calmly looked at the man, sitting by the headboard, who called the wind and summoned the rain: “Don’t shout, I will take responsibility of you.” He chuckled and said: “Okay, I’ll wait for you to take responsibility. You don’t need a lot of betrothal gifts; just ten miles of splendid clothing and thousand miles of dowry is fine.” Ye Muxi looked at the few coins in her wallet and calmly withdrew her promise: “Forget it, let’s just be friends.”\r\n\r\nEveryone in the capital of Nanyan knew that in order to fly onto a branch and become a phoenix, Ye Muxi, the daughter of the Ye family, was a starry-eyed fool who only ran after men with status and power. But who knew the man who kept bothering her constantly was not like his appearance; he was a demon, black to his blood and bone! !>"
