	"description": "Grace, the third prince born in a country where force is used in a turbulent world, has been given a non-combat power gift called “World Library”.\r\n\r\nGrace tries to explain his usefulness by using the knowledge of “World Library”, but he continues to be ridiculed by being compared with his two older brothers who have excellent fighting abilities such as “Kensei” and “Masei”. After continuing, he was banished to the undeveloped land.\r\n\r\nGrace was forced to cultivate in a land full of demons with a few companions, but his fate changed drastically when he met a girl lying asleep in the ruins.\r\n\r\n“Is this a golem?”\r\n\r\n“I’m galatea … not a golem, a robot.”\r\n\r\nHe learned about the existence of knowledge from another world by touching a girl who calls herself a robot. As a result, He was able to know the knowledge of another world.\r\n\r\nIn this way, he mixes the knowledge of this world with the knowledge of a far more civilized world, mass-producing rifles, developing agriculture in ways that were unthinkable in the past, and the new Mythril alloy. He created metal and developed his territory at a non-standard speed, starting the “Industrial Revolution.”>"
