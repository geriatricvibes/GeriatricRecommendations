	"description": "Cheng Huan woke up and had transmigrated as the villainess female supporting character in a novel.\n\nThe female supporting character was very money-loving and used her own son as a chip to try and get into a prestigious family. Finally, the child died in an accident and the female supporting character also met her tragic fate.\n\nCheng Huan, who had been single her entire life, looked at the teary-eyed little boy next to her, let out a sigh of relief, and picked up the heavy burden of being a mother.\n\nAs the days went on by, the legendary child’s father showed up spontaneously!\n\nCheng Huan: I really don’t want to be the third wheel in your relationship!!\n\nThe spontaneously-appeared male lead: ….but there is nobody else.>"
