	"description": "It was said that imperial harems were living hard lives. The emperor had a thousand methods to make a harem die an ignominious death. Besides, she might die due to the countless frame-ups and schemes from other jealous harems. Eight babies in tens were dead before they were delivered. With respect to the lucky two coming to the world, one of them would die before he grew up, and the other one… It was firmly believed by Yun Cang, the emperor, that the other one would grow up to a pillar of the nation.\n\nHua Qingxin asserted in a loud voice, “No! The other one will grow up with a distorted heart!”\n\nThe emperor: “So is it the reason for you to go to Prince Yun Hai for shelter?”\n\nJieyu Hua: “Yes… I want to share my bed with a man with strong chest muscles!”>"
