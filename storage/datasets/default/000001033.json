	"description": "When he woke up, Zhong Ziqi found that he had transmigrated over!\r\n\r\nIt’s okay that his family is very poor, but unexpectedly both of his parents are dead!\r\n\r\nEven if both of them are dead, he is actually a Ger!\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t really matter that he was a Ger, but who could have thought that he was sold by his elder uncle’s family!\r\n\r\nEven if he was sold, he was sold to a fool!\r\n\r\nZhong Ziqi was calm on the outside, but inside he was screaming: Could it be any worse?\r\n\r\nBut since I can’t do anything to prevent it, I might as well sit back and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nHowever, having such a silly person to accompany him in this unfamiliar and strange world, it’s, actually…not bad too.>"
