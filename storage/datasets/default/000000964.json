	"description": "I transmigrated into an otome game… wait, mom, you also transmigrated? Dad too? And brother too? \n\nIn the body of the daughter of Count Northland, Amy, transmigrated. This is an otome game! And it seems like she transmigrated  along with the rest of her family. Her role is the villainess! There is only one way to turn down the position of ‘Third Prince’s Fiancee Candidate’ without creating a fuss, and that is to eat a lot and get fat (mom’s suggestion).\n\nBesides, now that she was able to get a new life, there’s a dream she wants to fulfill no matter what– she really wants to keep a cat!>"
