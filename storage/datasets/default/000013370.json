I swear!\r\n\r\nBut, they both share the same hobbies and are very compatible with each other.\r\n\r\nAs a result, everytime I go, I end up having to spend time with him. I was reluctant at first, but as time went on I realized that spending time together is much more fun than spending time alone\r\n\r\nThis is a story about an ex husband and wife who return to their youth and are attracted to each other again.>"
