	"description": "Daikichi Yoshikawa, a sophomore in high school, witnesses his childhood sweetheart, Akari Beniya, cheating on him. When he asks her about it, she simply admits it and leaves him.\n\nAkari tells him that he is not masculine enough, so Daikichi begins a two-week survival program on his grandfather’s deserted island to learn how to be a man.\n\nA few days before his time on the deserted island is about to end, he discovers a beautiful girl named Yukiho washed up on the beach. She is a national idol, but Daikichi, who doesn’t watch TV, thinks she is just a beautiful girl and helps her.\n\nThis triggers a confession from Yukiho to Daikichi. Soon the two start dating.\n\nThe relationship between Yukiho and Daikichi becomes known throughout Japan through national TV.\n\nNaturally, it catches the attention of Akari.\n\nThen, after all this time, she pressures Daikichi to get back together.>"
