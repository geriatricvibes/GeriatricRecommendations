	"description": "Even as he is burnt at the stake, the martyr roars out the truth.\n\n'The cycle of the celestial bodies is something that cannot be changed! The stars in the sky cannot be put away in a box! The world will inevitably acknowledge the truth of Heliocentrism! You, the self-proclaimed 'God' are merely a higher-level lifeform, not the omnipotent creator!'\n\nLearning wholeheartedly from their teachers, the scholars studying the natural sciences persevere unremittingly to inherit the knowledge passed on for generation upon generation. One day, even the so-called 'God' will lie upon the experimentation platform as a dissection specimen!>"
