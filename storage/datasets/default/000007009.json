	"description": "In a world that closely resembles earth.\n\nIt was a parallel world, but at the same time, it was a world of swords and magic.\n\nA world where dungeons appear and monsters terrorise people…\n\nReincarnated into such a world, former salaryman [Amano Taiyo] chooses the job class of [warrior] to succeed in this modern fantasy-like earth.\n\nEven if that job is ridiculed as the weakest job in the academy, and is treated with ridicule, he still doesn’t remove his warrior calling.\n\nHe dreamed of becoming the strongest adventurer by cultivating the job class that nobody would keep.\n\nNo, he had to become it.\n\nCan Amano Taiyo really become the strongest in a world with a job class that everyone calls the weakest?\n\nDungeons, an adventurer’s guild, and monsters… In a modern earth of swords and magic bearing an uncanny resemblance to japan, this is the story of a warrior, ridiculed as the weakest in the world, aiming for the peak!>"
