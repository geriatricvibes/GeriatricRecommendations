	"description": "Unwilling to accept a business marriage arranged by the family, Wen Ruan, the precious daughter of a wealthy family knew that she had to be independent, so she left home carrying a stack of credit cards.\n\nUnfortunately, she got entangled with a few human traffickers as soon as she stepped off the train but luckily she was rescued by a handsome man. Obsessed with pretty boys and captivated by his looks, she pretended to be poor, clung to him, and wormed her way into his house.\n\n“I am from out of town. I’m poor, lonely, and helpless and the traffickers are keeping their eyes on me. If you drive me away, I’ll be sold.”\n\nFu Zhihuan glanced at the limited edition red Hermes suitcase that Wen Ruan was carrying and fell silent.\n\nWen Ruan: Isn’t a five thousand dollar dress considered cheap?!\n\nWen Ruan: I only bought two bags this week……only two bags! !>"
