	"description": "He was an indifferent fiancé.\r\nNot knowing that his fiancée was abused.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he started taking care of me.\r\nHe separated from the abusive marquis and helped them become independent.\r\n\r\nWhy was the Duke of Seehorn Blair taking care of me by taking time out of his busy schedule?\r\nI foolishly expected that he might have come to love me.\r\nHowever, the result of my courageous confession was a callous refusal.\r\n\r\n“I admit that my words and actions were worthy of misunderstanding, but I don’t love you. It can never be. You are ‘the enemy who poisoned me’.”\r\n\r\nBefore returning, I was the villain who poisoned her husband.\r\nAfter the return, the Duke of Seehorn Blair only edified me to prevent a pre-planned tragedy.\r\n\r\nIf that were true, there was no place for me to stand here.\r\nIn the present reality, I did not kill him, but I was willing to disappear for the sake of the one I love.\r\n\r\n“…Thank you for that. I will never appear in front of you again.”>"
