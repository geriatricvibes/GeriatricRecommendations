	"description": "Late at night in the middle of my part time job at a convenience store, I had an encounter with a robber and was mercilessly stabbed to death.\r\n\r\nAs I was about to lose my consciousness, I thought about how much I wanted to do this and that when I heard a voice……\r\n\r\n『The wish to be summoned has been confirmed. Granting Unique Skill 《Jack of all Trades, Master of None》』\r\n\r\nRude words such as that were said. Jack of All Trades, Master of None? Don’t screw with me!\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts and wishes were for naught as my consciousness faded, when I came too I was standing on a green foggy hill.>"
