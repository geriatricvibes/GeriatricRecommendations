	"description": "Faritina, who was born into one of the richest families in the kingdom, looks back on a nightmare. \r\n\r\nI remember: wasn't my little brother born two years ago? I had forgotten, but when I went to visit him, he was so cute, and I wanted to protect this sickly little boy.\r\n\r\nIf the nightmare was a premonition, would she herself and the other siblings be caught up in the Dukes' downfall and die?\r\n\r\nAt least if we survive, we will be able to laugh one day.\r\n\r\nI will protect you. Your smile is our hope.>"
