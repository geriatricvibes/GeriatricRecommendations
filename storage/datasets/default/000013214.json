	"description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel only realized it at the end of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of the empire, Ian Dakendov, that she was nothing to him.... She was an inconvenient burden for him.\r\n\r\nIt was a master - servant relationship, but Rachel was confident that she would go anywhere with him if he wanted.  \r\n\r\nEven that day when Ian was fleeing for his life under threat, Rachel was willing to follow him. She didn't have the slightest hesitation even if it was a dangerous path. Because she didn’t want to leave Ian alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, death was the only thing that returned to her who was with him in the difficult moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's how everything ended, she thought. But Rachel returned to the day before running away with Ian. \r\n\r\n\r\n“I'm going to leave the Imperial Castle tonight. You should be ready too.' \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this life, she didn’t want to be hurt and abandoned. He didn’t need her and she didn’t want to look at him anymore.\r\n\r\nRachel ran away from Ian before the tragedy could repeat itself. To a place he didn’t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nIan wouldn’t find her, and even if he tried, he wouldn’t be able to find her in this vast empire. \r\n\r\nShe thought she’d never see Ian again..... \r\n\r\nHe came to the place where she escaped to. \r\n>"
