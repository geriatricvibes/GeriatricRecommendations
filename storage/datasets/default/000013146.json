	"description": "Katharina is a witch who can produce little mana by nature.\n\nOne day, she takes on a two-month-old witch. “What’s the name of this cute little girl?”\n\n“Name?”\n\nKatarina glanced down at her. Her golden eyes are relieved just by her eye contact. “…Gretel.”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I’m going to fatten you up and eat you, Gretel. I’m sure I’ll succeed this time.”\n\nBut there was a setback in her plan…\n\n“I’m a man.”\n\n“You…If you are lying to me, I’ll eat you….”\n\n“I’m not lying!”\n\nI don’t think she is telling the truth. That can’t be true. Witch can’t be a man. No, if you are a man then you’re not a witch in the first place!\n\nWill she ever eat Gretel?>"
