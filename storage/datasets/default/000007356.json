	"description": "A high school boy, Itsuki Tomonari, gets involved in a kidnapping and ends up taking care of Hinako Konohana, a young lady from one of Japan's largest conglomerates.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, Hinako seems to be a brilliant and charming girl, but in reality, she is a lazy girl with no life skills. However, due to family reasons, Hinako has to play the role of the 'perfect young lady' at school.\r\n\r\nWanting to protect her, Itsuki takes care of her in a very caring manner. Eventually, Hinako begins to fawn on Itsuki with all her might...\r\n\r\n'Now...if Itsuki isn't around, I would hate it.'\r\n\r\nThis is a love story that begins with a cute young lady with a gap that transcends the master-servant relationship.>"
