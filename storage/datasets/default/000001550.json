	"description": "In this first ever novelization based on the work of The New York Times-bestselling mangaka Jun Mochizuki, the elaborate, charming, and bittersweet world of Pandora Hearts is woven into short stories that peer into the houses of the four great dukedoms and reveal yet more facets to the seriesâ€™ beloved characters. Making each volume of this series even more special are the manga shorts drawn specially for the novelization by Jun Mochizuki herself!>"
