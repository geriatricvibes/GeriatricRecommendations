	"description": "It’s a harsh world for foxes to live in, so they have to become human.\n\nShe was my mother who died after saying that.\n\nI have to become a human as my mother said…\n\n“I have to seduce a man and swallow him.”\n\nAlthough I tried to seduce most men, they didn’t appeal to me.\n\n“Scholar. Can I borrow a blanket over there?”\n\nA blunt scholar who suddenly met in the middle of the mountain entered Yeon-hee’s heart.\n\n“Be prepared, because today I will send you to paradise.”\n\nThe man’s ears turned red at Yeon-hee's bold statement.>"
