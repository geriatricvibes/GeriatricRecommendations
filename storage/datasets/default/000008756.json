	"description": "Even the most capable people cannot escape calamity.  Zhang Ping, who dreamed of becoming the world’s best, voluntarily enters the palace to become a eunuch before his father has to resort to plundering and crime.  \n\nHow can a prince be so thin and bony, that was Zhang Ping’s first impression of Huangfu Jie. \n\nThe prince looks at the kneeling eunuch, the scars and wounds on his body not yet healing. \n\nZhang Ping’s eyes turn red—I curse your ancestors for eighteen generations!\n\nHe is just little uglier; weirder than normal people. \n\nAre ugly people not human?  I, Zhang Ping, swear to cultivate the world’s second best over here in the palace!>"
