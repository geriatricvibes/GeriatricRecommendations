	"description": "I was reincarnated in a Rated-19 horror novel. As the roommate who was horribly murdered by the crossdresser who commits a massacre from blackening due to his terrible childhood.\r\n\r\nWouldn’t the massacre be prevented if the man’s lack of affection was resolved?!\r\n\r\nSo I confessed to him.\r\n\r\n“I-I like you!”\r\n“….I’m a girl.”\r\n\r\nHuh? Oh, oops!\r\nBut, I still like you!\r\n\r\nThe milk has already been spilt. I worked hard to prevent the massacre in the original novel by sticking close to the crossdressing protagonist. Now, all I have to do is reveal that this person was a man….Won’t he ever get caught dressing up as a woman?!\r\n\r\n“Hey, you’re a man!”\r\n\r\n“….N-no. Don’t abandon me, Bree.”\r\n\r\nHe even burst into tears.\r\nWhy are you crying!?\r\n>"
