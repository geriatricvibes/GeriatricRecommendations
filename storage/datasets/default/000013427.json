	"description": "“Shiyu, my heart does not lie.” With these words of deep passion, Chu Mingyun inserts his hand back into his sleeve and pinches himself.\r\n\r\nSu Shiyu’s smile deepens all of a sudden. He squints his eyes and gently parts his mouth to say, “Are you sick?”\r\n\r\n“Lovesickness,” Chu Mingyun answers resolutely.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me.” Su Shiyu nods, turns his body and leaves.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe story of a person feigning  a cut-sleeve who truly became a cut-sleeve and a person who didn’t want to get involved with a cut-sleeve became the cut-sleeve first.>"
