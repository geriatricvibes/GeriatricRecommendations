	"description": "Everyone said that the S College’s school prince, Fu Shihan, was aloof and noble, steady and reserved. He never talked more than three sentences with girls. \r\n\r\nOnly Huo Yan knew how Fu Shihan hugged her under the Chinese parasol tree back then, greedily biting her lips. \r\n\r\nHuo Yan was gasping for air, begging him in a small face. Fu Shihan’s heart was pounding rapidly. \r\n\r\nThe adorable and comedic heroine vs. the aloof, noble, possessive, and black-belly devil.\r\n\r\n【The cold and aloof devil can sometimes be gentle.】\r\n\r\nHuo Yan said her first word when she was five. Even when she grew up, she was naive and clumsy. She was even slow in walking. \r\n\r\nOne day, she noticed a Rolls-Royce following behind her and was moving even slower than her.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\nFu Shihan clutched the steering wheel as he looked ahead with his fiery peach blossom eyes. \r\n\r\nHe faintly said, “Going on a stroll.”\r\n\r\nFrom that day on. Huo Yan thought that this man had a mental disorder.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she tried her best to let him have his way, trying not to trigger him.\r\n\r\nAfter they fought one day, Fu Shihan said, “Don’t be angry at me.”\r\n\r\nHuo Yan pursed her lips and said, “I’m not angry. Why would I be angry at a fool?”\r\n\r\nFu Shihan lit the cigarette in his hand, replying, “Then come over and let me hug you.”\r\n\r\nHuo Yan hesitated before gently hugging his waist. She said in a low voice, “Only for a little bit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
