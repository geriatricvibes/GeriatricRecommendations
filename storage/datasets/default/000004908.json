	"description": "“Say hello, Ravia. He’s going to be your brother.”\r\n\r\nA silver-haired man, whom my father brought in one day and called the son of a distant relative.\r\nHe was the man who would take everything from me.\r\n\r\nMy position, my family, and even my life. I am an extra, but I am desperate to regain what was taken from me, and I was destined to die for him.\r\n\r\n‘In fact, he’s not a distant relative or anything.’\r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter.\r\nAs long as he’s the male lead, there’s nothing he can’t do as he pleases.\r\nAll I could do was play as a sweet sister for me to survive.\r\n\r\n“I want to get along with you, Tidwell.”\r\n\r\nI was going to run away as soon as the male lead started suspecting me. But, something’s wrong.\r\n\r\n“Sister. Are you going to throw me away, too?”\r\n\r\nI thought he was just suspicious of me, but what is this obsession?\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have taken me into your arms if you were going to leave like this.”>"
