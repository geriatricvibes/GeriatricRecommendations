	"description": "Celestial Wind was the number one virtual reality MMORPG game in Korea.\n\nLured in by a large-scale update, Rhee Mujin entered the game after a long hiatus.\n\n‘Huh?’\n\nSomeone had already messed with his main quest. The moment he realized that, the entrance to the dungeon was restricted and was forced to turn away. He didn’t know who did it, but they wouldn’t mess with him so easily the second time around.\n\nHe’ll start from here.\n\n…Or at least that’s what he thought.>"
