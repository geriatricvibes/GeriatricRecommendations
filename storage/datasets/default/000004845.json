	"description": "Bailuo, our main character, has just gained a cheat system, an NPC who can help Bailuo navigate easily through any life he is presented with, gaining favorability points with minimal effort. Bailuo can then exchange those favorability points for anything he wants.\n\nThe trusted personal assistant who betrayed him and attacked him for the sake of his younger brother; the emperor who used him as a weapon to charm and seduce his prince brother in order to seize the throne; the admirer of his younger brother who used him as a substitute...\n\nBailuo: I'll just watch this show go down. Don't even need to say a word.\n\nSneakpeaks:\nIn the first arc, Bailuo is a cannon fodder ends up with all the scumbags. All the characters act very abusively, like a stepmother. Readers who like sweet pampering should start reading from arc two.\n\nThe second arc is Bailuo's comeback arc, with the same setting as the first arc but with Bailuo falling in love with the real male lead this time. He also goes around returning the abuses of some of those scumbags as well.\n\nAs for the third arc, well, the title will be self explanatory. Just wait and see...>"
