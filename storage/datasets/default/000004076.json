	"description": "　Kian, a former warrior monk in a religious nation, was the weakest despite his best efforts due to a constitution with almost no magic power. When Kian is expelled from his country for his weakness, he flees to a neighboring country, but even there he finds himself living at the very bottom of the heap.\r\n\r\n　One day, Kian, who found himself becoming an old man, was exiled from the Adventurers' Guild.\r\n\r\n　In his desperate situation, he obtains a mysterious magical tool, which awakens his ability to charm women and absorb magic power from those he has sex with, and turns his life 180 degrees from a life of a sloppy loser to a life of a dominant, aggressive, and victorious harem.\r\n\r\n　This is the story of a man who was despised by those around him but became stronger and stronger and rose to the top, sexually subjugates a girl who confronts him, and makes them a member of his harem as a sexual handler and magic power bag.>"
