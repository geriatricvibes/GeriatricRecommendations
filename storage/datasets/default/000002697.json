	"description": "As a new anchor of StarTV, Yu Yan’s ruthless trash-talk, natural rifle-shooting skills, and character of never searching houses earned him a big crowd of fans.\r\n\r\nHe felt like he was a good anchor who treated all fans of his stream equally—you can suck at the game, you can get knocked down, but if you want the gun in my hand, sorry, no way man.\r\n\r\nUntil he heard the voice of the streaming platform’s Big Boss.\r\n\r\nYu · ultimate voice-con · Yan: I’m not familiar with this game, swap my Kar98k for your Mini-14.\r\n\r\nYi · brand new noob · Chen: En.\r\n\r\nFriend: Daddy, I want to snipe too!\r\n\r\nYu Yan: I think this frying pan suits you very well.\r\n\r\nNot-a-very good gamer but dripping with money and looks Big Boss vs Cute, super good trash-talking gunslinger voice-con Anchor.>"
