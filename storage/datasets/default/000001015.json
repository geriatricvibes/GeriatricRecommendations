	"description": "Lou Jing was beaten half to death by his father, then forced to enter the Eastern Palace. Becoming the Crown Prince’s Consort meant that he was no longer the Duke’s heir apparent. His future was ruined! The only thing Lou Jing could do? Help the Crown Prince, and protect the kingdom…\n\nEmperor: “My Empress, please note that I’m technically the husband here.”\n\nLou Jing picked up the person dressed in Imperial dragon robes and laughed, saying: “I know, I know, this loyal subject definitely won’t tire your Majesty out in bed!”>"
