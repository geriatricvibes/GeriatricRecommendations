	"description": "Xu Yangyi, an 18-year-old high school student, for the reason that his older twin sister eloped with her girlfriend on the wedding day, was forced to be the surrogate bride by his own father. As a result, he became the wife of the man who should have been his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“You’ve gotta look at me carefully. I’m a man.” Xu Yangyi glared at He Jingyan, who was still getting fresh with him though he already knew Xu Yangyi was indeed a man.\r\n\r\n“Man?” He Jingyan fiddled with Xu Yangyi’s face with his big hand and gave him a sly smile, “You look identical with your sister, so it doesn’t matter!”>"
