	"description": "Seiichi Takeda who yearned for a free life was given a chance to reincarnate into a different world. Since he has little trust in others (no, he is not an edgy MC. He is normal), he chose the lowly job (seen in high society aka Aristocracy) of a porter, the only job that has a storage skill (there are magical bags tho). \n\nThis is the story of a man conquering a different world with his low amount of mana utilizing things like skills, equipment, and drugs.>"
