He successfully repaired the sect's supreme technique, the Secret Manual of Space and Time, and became its spacetime descendant.\r\n\r\nAfter three months, players officially logged into the Mystical World game. Mu Yu was already the pride of South Sky.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, when the players had grown up, Mu Yu had already become the most dazzling Saint under the starry sky.\r\n\r\n….\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Misty Cloud Mountain, a young girl in a white dress nestled in Mu Yu's embrace as she cried, 'I, Nalan Yanran, would rather die than marry that young master of the Xiao family. I only wish to marry you in this life.'\r\n\r\n'Ding!' You have successfully triggered a 3-star mission! to help Nalan Yanran go to the Xiao family to end the engagement! '\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute, this script isn't right. Can't we just not do it?' Mu Yu felt like crying.\r\n\r\n'Either way! Either die! ' The System pulled out a 10m long broadsword.\r\n\r\n'Stop, can't I do it...' Mu Yu submitted.>"
