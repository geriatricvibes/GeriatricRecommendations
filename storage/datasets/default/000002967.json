	"description": "In front of Se-yeong was Baek Je-ha, who was full of life and just turned twenty years old. Nevertheless, nothing had changed from when she first met him, a 17-year-old boy who was full of youth, in front of the music room.\r\n\r\nBlatant interest, favoring, affection. None of it had changed. No, it could be said it deepened during the time she did not see him.\r\n\r\n“I want to hold hands, go on a date, and kiss Senior. I saved all my firsts to do with Han Se-yeong.” \r\n\r\n“Then… do it. With me.”\r\n\r\nSe-yeong pressed her lips as if she were stamping them. Even though she was pressing on his lips, Je-ha was so madly happy that his breath became rough.\r\n\r\nJe-ha instinctively pushed his tongue inside. As if very delicious honey was hidden inside it. \r\n\r\nLosing his mind, he took control of Se-yeong’s mouth, but he felt her hand hitting his back, so he stepped back.\r\n\r\n“Haa! Ha… Ah…!”\r\n\r\nSe-yeong, who thought she was about to be suffocated to death, breathed shallowly.\r\n\r\n“I’m going crazy. How can others casually do this as if it is nothing?” \r\n\r\nJe-ha smiled bitterly as he wiped his sore lips with the back of his hand. Even though the night air was chilly, she was sweating because of how much her temperature went up by a kiss.\r\n\r\nShe also wondered if what she did was a real kiss. If kissing meant being voraciously greedy for each other’s saliva.\r\n\r\n“Let’s do it again. I’ll do better this time.”>"
