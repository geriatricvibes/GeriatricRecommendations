	"description": "This is a tale of blood and tears about collecting pets.\r\n\r\nIn his entire life, the greatest ambition of the free-spirited little devil, Shooting Star, is to collect all sorts of beautiful pets.\r\n\r\nElves and angels are definitely on the list. Can legendary mermaids be included too? If so, how about a dragon as well?\r\n\r\nHowever, one should not bite off more than one can chew. When defeating monsters, one should not start with the Demon King first, so of course, one should not start collecting pets with a dragon.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to start the collection with this amber-eyed swordsman!\r\n\r\nShooting Star: I’m just an honorable, veteran member of the Appearances Association. Is wishing to collect beautiful pets against the law? Since when did I end up riding the luxurious, one-way train to doomsday? Can I still disembark right now?\r\n\r\nOh My GOD~\r\n\r\nEven if GOD says that doomsday is approaching, pets still need to be collected!>"
