	"description": "Yun Ling was invited to attend the public beta test of “Apocalypse Calamity.” In the end, she successfully survived a hundred days, and obtained the “Lord Token”, “Life Skill Level Retention” and “S Rank Skill” as rewards.\r\n\r\nThe beta ended, and she waited with anticipation for the opening of the game. But then the world became the game… …\r\n\r\nYun — life skill player — Ling thought, what could she do? Continue to drag out her ignoble existence.\r\n\r\nIntermediate Fishing, Intermediate Foraging, Advanced Sewing, Advanced Cooking. So many life skills in hand. She wanted to hoard grain, produce, recruit troops, build, and turn her land into an indestructible steel fort.>"
