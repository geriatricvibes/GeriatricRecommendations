	"description": "I was the same, but the world had changed. \r\n\r\n[You are the new constellation of realm #381jh051.] \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t enough to have entered the world of the novel, so I’m a constellation. \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the guy who was stuck in the elevator with me was the problem. \r\n\r\nThis guy was the enemy of mankind who turned black and destroyed the world in the original. \r\n\r\n‘Isn’t one of the reasons he turned black was because he wasn’t chosen by the constellations?’ \r\n\r\nNow that this has happened, I have no choice but to support Baek Tae-beom (백태범) and escape from here! \r\n\r\n[Skill: Activate support.] \r\n\r\n[Skill: Sponsorship has been canceled.] \r\n\r\n[The 10,000 coin sponsorship has been canceled.] \r\n\r\n[Reason: Lack of coins] \r\n\r\n[Current Coins: 0] \r\n\r\nWait a minute. \r\n\r\nI think I’m screwed. \r\n\r\n[In original text] \r\n\r\n“Don’t disappear in front of me again, Hyung.” \r\n\r\nBaek Tae-beom smiled with bright yellow eyes like a beast. I couldn’t help but stare at him as if possessed by his fatally beautiful figure. \r\n\r\n“Then I really don’t know what will happen to me.”>"
