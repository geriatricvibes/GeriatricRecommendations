	"description": "This is the story of a lonely young man.\n\nThis young man comes from wealth and prestige, is well-endowed in both appearance and temperament, is a warlord by profession, and has no unhealthy avocations. In the opening of this romance, he is in the course of performing military service in some desolate dump, making a living from pillaging neighbouring towns and moonlighting as an opium dealer.>"
