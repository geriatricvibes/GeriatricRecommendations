It was a relationship that wasn’t meant to be, so she couldn’t tell him.\n\n“I’m actually pregnant with your child.”\n\nThen Islay’s grandmother came to visit.\n\n“10,000 derk. This should be enough for you to get lost.”\n\nBut now she had to protect the child she carried.\n\n“100,000 derk.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“If it’s not that much, I won’t break up with him.”\n\nThen she disappeared from the capital.\n\nSeven years passed.\n\nAnd Islay finally found his lost lover.>"
