	"description": "200 years after the world has ended, the laws of society have long been forgotten.\n\nCountless grotesque monsters now run amok on this the earth and Reavers who devour and massacre humans follow suit.\n\nIn this hopeless world, the devil hunters who have caused the devil to have gone extinct roam from place to place.\n\nBut in a world without the devils, for what reason do these hunters continue to mindlessly travel throughout the lands?\n\nMaybe it is to just survive.\n\nThe devil hunters continue on.\n\nIn this godforsaken world, the protagonist Zin meets a little girl named Leona, a girl whose entire life was nothing but pain, and search for the meaning of his life.\n\nThe threads of fate slowly come together.\n\nThe wheel of destiny continues to spin.>"
