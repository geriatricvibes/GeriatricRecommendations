	"description": "Unable to control his mouth, Lin Jian Yin scared away eight previous girlfriends and six previous managers thanks to his poisonous words. Finally unable to stand it, he goes to a strange antique shop recommended by his friend. The shop supposedly has something that can help him.\r\n\r\nEven though a Nintendo that plays cartridges is a bit outdated, and probably no one plays it anymore, isn’t it too exaggerated to place it in an antique shop to sell?\r\n\r\nAfter returning home with a Nintendo, Lin Jian Yin inserts the cartridge that the owner sold to him at a huge discount. Only then does he discover that this is actually a simulation game. The female protagonist isn’t a cute loli, nor is she a mature woman. Rather, with her old lady hair and blue-white slippers, she is such a frightening woman that calling her a Taiwanese babe would seriously be insulting Taiwanese babes.\r\n\r\nGods! His mission is actually to help this woman marry a perfect prince! How is that possible!!!\r\n\r\nWait, as the main guy protagonist, Lin Jian Yin actually isn’t the prince. Then, then, who exactly is he… No, “what” exactly is he?>"
