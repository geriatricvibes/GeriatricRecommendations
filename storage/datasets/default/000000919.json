	"description": "I possessed the cliché villainess.\n\nIt was Mary Conler, a villainess who was eventually exiled out of the country for harassing the female lead.\n\nBeing abducted at birth, once she returned from the orphanage\n\nShe was called the troublemaker of the Grand Duke Conler’s Family.\n\nBeing thrown away by her father and brothers who held no affection for her.\n\nI made a resolution.\n\nLet’s live as quietly as a dead mouse, then run away to a foreign country with some living funds.\n\nBut it’s weird.\n\nMy dad, who I thought didn’t love Mary, suddenly became a fool for his daughter\n\nMy brothers clung to me,\n\nOne of my goofy cousins was growling at my fiance.\n\nMy fiance, the prince, was angry at the idea of breaking off the engagement,\n\nAnd the original heroine asked me to run away with her.\n\nI guess I became a nuisance in a slightly different way?\n\nWhy the hell were they being so nice to me?\n\nMy dream is to be single!>"
