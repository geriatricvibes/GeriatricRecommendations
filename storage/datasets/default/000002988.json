	"description": "At the center of the world, on Mount Olympus, the King of Gods, Zeus, smiled and looked down on the realms with his Spear of Lightning tightly in his hand. Before him were a pantheon of deities.\n\nAt the Silver Hall in the north, Odin overlooked the world on his Almighty Throne, with Gungnir in hand. In his eyes were an endless field of wind and snow.\n\nOn the Nile River in the south, Amon who was at the helm of his sun boat cast his eyes toward the Aegean Seas, at his feet were a mountain of bones.\n\nIn the land of the two rivers, Marduk, the Lord of Light and Wisdom, held the eternal fire and gazed upon the Western Lands. King Gilgamesh, his hero, brought to Greece his oracle, and his ships covered the seas as far as the eyes could see.\n\nFinally, at Plato Academy, a youngster named Su Ye walked up a mountain and reached its summit.>"
