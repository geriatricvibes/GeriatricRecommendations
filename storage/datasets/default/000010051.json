	"description": "The king of assassins was reborn, mastering both alchemy and poison.  Sitting inside the space, there was a ghost that loved crying.\n\nBuying a sickly boy for a hundred gold coins, becoming the master of half a country for no reason.\n\nOn their wedding night.  She slightly hooked her jade finger, “Come here.”\n\nThe man tried weakly bargaining, “Can I redeem myself?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Can we wait for the bridal chamber tomorrow?”\n\nShe cast a cold gaze, “Give me a reason.”\n\n“I…..My period is here.”\n\nHer head was covered in black lines, “Do you think you would even believe that!”\n\nAfter four hours——\n\nShe weakly said, “I can’t go on anymore, wait until tomorrow.”\n\nThe man revealed an evil charming smile and turned her over before pressing down, “Want to run?  Too late!”>"
