	"description": "There is a town called Karin in a faraway land from the capital city of the kingdom of Clarith. There lived a military man named Yui Istats. ­Being solely known for his laziness, he lacks any motivation, completely not making any progress in the tasks assigned to him. Nevertheless there was a particular mission for him. Disguising himself as an inconspicuous person, he was advancing daily internal inspections in order to correct the decaying deeds of nobles. And before that kind of him appeared the princess Elise. From the strong sense of justice she tried to resolve the present state of affairs with her own hands, and was kidnapped by a sect that didn’t approve her actions. And Yui, who was called ‘good-for-nothing’ by Elise, came up with a plan in order to rescue the princess?!\n\nLackadaisical hero(?) is sent, the tale of a hidden hero! Unique military history fantasy, part one!>"
