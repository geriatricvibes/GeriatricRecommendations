	"description": "Shen Shuyun had never understood why the young prince of the Ning family would fall in love with an ordinary person like himself at first sight and never forget about him.\n\nWhen Ning Wan put the divorce agreement in front of him, he finally understood.\n\nFrom start to finish, it wasn’t him that Ning Wan loved, but his pheromones.\n\n—-\n\nNing Wan had once told Shen Shuyun: ” Whenever you’re tired of walking, just turn back…I would be right there.”\n\nHowever, when Shen Shuyun really needed Ning Wan, he turned back and there was no one behind him.>"
