	"description": "“I can’t promise you love, but I’ll have no other woman but you.”\n\nI thought it would be okay. Even if he didn’t love me, I thought my love would make our marriage happy. But that naive wish was soon shattered.\n\nBecause Lizzena, Raymond’s first love, came back with a kid.\n\n“Lize is trying to make her child be the First Prince,” he told me.\n\n“Let’s get a divorce.”\n\nI decided to abandon him.\n\n***\n\n“What?”\n\nRaymond’s eyes shook violently as if he didn’t understand my words. His agitation, seen for the first time, for some reason made me feel relieved.\n\nI opened my lips to him again with a soft smile: “I want to leave you. So Raymond, let’s stop now. Divorce me.”\n\nIt was the end of a long unrequited love.>"
