	"description": "What is love?\n\nLove is a wound that is unable to be exposed merely from pictures;\n\nLove is a sorrow that is unable to be expressed solely by words;\n\nBut love consists of more than just pain and despair,\n\nLove can be exhilarating, it can also be blissful.\n\nEven if it’s ambiguous, it can still be mutually protected for life.\n\nIn this novel, there are many stories; some maybe vague, others perhaps clear.>"
