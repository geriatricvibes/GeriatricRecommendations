	"description": "I, Olga Rifald, have remembered the moment my engagement was canceled.\n\nI had died in an accident and got reborn as the heroine in the Otome Game “Princess Road”.\n\nThe end of this engagement signifies the start of the game.\n\n… And, if I’m careless, I will head towards the death route at full speed.\n\n… Eh? Isn’t that dangerous? Ain’t dying dangerous?\n\nI have already died in my past life, so at least here, I would like to live peacefully…!\n\n… That being the case, I will do my best to aim towards the slowlife.\n\n… Even though that was the plan!>"
