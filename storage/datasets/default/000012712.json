I'll protect you, Haruka!'\r\n\r\nTwo people born and raised in a certain town in a certain region...\r\n\r\nThey lived next door to each other and were the same age, a boy and a girl.\r\n\r\nThey smiled at each other and said, 'We're going to be together forever...' Their parents also smiled at them.\r\n\r\nSome time passed, and just one day after I entered the third grade of elementary school, such a routine came to an unexpected end.\r\n\r\n'Haruka-chan....I'm moving far away from here...'\r\n\r\n'What….?'\r\n\r\n'I’m sorry...Haruka-chan...'\r\n\r\n'Hiroto-kun, I don't want you to go...no...don't go...'\r\n\r\nThe last time Hiroto saw Haruka's face, it wasn’t smiling, but crying...\r\n\r\nHiroto and Haruka then grew distant.\r\n\r\nSeven years have passed, Hiroto and Haruka, who are now in their first year of high school in a faraway place, different from where they were born and raised, unknowingly meet again.\r\n\r\nThey meet again without realizing it, and the cogs of their stopped clocks start to turn once more.>"
