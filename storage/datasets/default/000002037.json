	"description": "Fourteen year-old An’ne Orihara jumped to her death in anguish because of bullying from her classmates. She wakes up immediately after dying and an angel appears to announce that she has a period of forty-nine days to decide whether she wants to go to Heaven or Hell. Now a ghost, she tumbles into the home of the supernatural-sensing classmate, Hiroto Sakaki. As they spend time together, she realizes her true feelings for the first time after death,  while on the other hand, the members who bullied An’ne are swallowed up one by one in mysterious incidents.>"
