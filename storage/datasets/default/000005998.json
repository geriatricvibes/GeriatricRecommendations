	"description": "On her way back from a training trip to a neighboring country, the beautiful wizard, Francesca Dumer, was attacked by strange demons and was in mortal danger. The one who summoned a spirit of fire and saved her was Lou Brandell, an enigmatic wizard with black hair and dark eyes. Francesca convinced Lou, an aspiring adventurer, to become a temporary teacher at a Girls Magic Academy, where she serves as acting principal. While Francesca was awed by Lou's vast knowledge and overwhelming magic, she was also strongly attracted to him.>"
