	"description": "“I will make you a princess.” \r\n\r\nSasha lived in an alley with pickpocketers. She was suspected of being Princess Anastasia who disappeared a long time ago, due to the sale of the necklace she had when she was a child\r\n\r\n“It will be a disaster if you turn out to be a scammer.” \r\n\r\n'I will take responsibility.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'Is my title not enough?'\r\n\r\nBuying time until the real Anastasia appears. That was the “deal” between the duke and her. \r\n\r\n'You said you'd let me go when we’re done. What if you really like me?'\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless, I will not do anything against your will.'\r\n\r\nBut somehow, the duke became sincere to her. \r\n\r\n'I'm already yours.'\r\n\r\nShe should disappear. \r\n\r\nThat way, she’ll live.\r\n>"
