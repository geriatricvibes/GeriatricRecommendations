	"description": "Ye Yisheng was not a confident person. The man she loved was too outstanding, and she lacked the courage to fight for this love. When faced with an outstanding competitor, she cowardly retreated. However, there was always one type of outstanding man, who wanted just one particular flower amidst the glorious garden. Thankfully, Yisheng met this sort of man. She desired too little, and he loved too deeply.>"
