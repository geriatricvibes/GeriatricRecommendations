	"description": "Chen Qizhao was reborn and returned to the age of 18 when he was still the wicked little overlord of the Chen family.\r\n\r\nAt this time, his brother hadn’t experienced a car accident while his parents were in good health and weren’t seriously ill. The Chen family was still the prosperous Chen family and everyone thought he was a good-for-nothing who was useless and easily taken advantage of.\r\n\r\n“He only knows how to quarrel with his older brother every day. He is arrogant and willful!”\r\n\r\n“He looks good, but unfortunately, he is an idiot.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he a useless person? Just serve him well.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity about that child of the Chen family.”\r\n\r\nThere were the group of scoundrel friends who were full of thoughts, the rats eyeing him covetously and the old, cunning people who were secretly scheming.\r\n\r\nChen Qizhao put on a mask of arrogance again. ‘Do you like acting so much? Why don’t we act together?’\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until later that everyone discovered that at the end of the play, they would either go bankrupt or be imprisoned.>"
