	"description": "Zhang Siyi comes back from his overseas studies in architecture and is looking for work. His girlfriend, however, is full of complaints, for Zhang Siyi never has time for her. She breaks up with him in a fit of rage while throwing coffee over him.\n\nZhang Siyi manages to dodge the coffee, but unfortunately, it hits the guy behind him instead. Just when he is about to do something about it, the guy dismisses him and leaves.\n\nZhang Siyi thought that would be the end of it, but who would’ve thought that the very next day, he will meet the man again… in a job interview. And being hired by him will be just the beginning.>"
