	"description": "'It was a regular day when Zhou Qingfeng chose to spend his afternoon watching a random movie he stumbled upon on the internet. \r\n\r\nIt described a mysterious and instantaneous collapse of all governments worldwide that plunged the world into a lawless Wasteland. Unsatisfied with the ending, Zhou Qingfeng boldly proclaimed that he could have handled the situation better if he had been the protagonist. \r\n\r\nTo his surprise, his rant was answered by the creator of the movie—a self-proclaimed “GOD''—who offered to magically transport Zhou Qingfeng into the world of the movie, just before the Catastrophe, so he could walk the talk. Armed only with his foresight and a few special skills granted to him, Zhou Qingfeng uncertainly stepped into a chaotic world of dangers and adventure. There he will have to make preparations and important decisions in a foreign land to have any hope of surviving the unforgiving Wasteland.'>"
