	"description": "The protagonist, Punk, is a cautious, cold-blooded, and ruthless Mage.\n\nHis goal is always his top priority, over feelings or morality. When unnecessary, he doesn’t like to act like pigs to eat tigers; there are almost no life and death struggles, sometimes risky but steady progress. No strong enemy everywhere, Instead, Punk is always a strong enemy of others.\n\nAnd he has a very keen interest in the secrets and teachings of the Netheril civilization.>"
