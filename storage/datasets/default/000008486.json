	"description": "Once transmigrated, facing the Emperor who claimed to hate him to the bone but overwhelmed him when he was not ready, Liu Yuzhen, as an Interpol agent, had only one thought in his heart, that is, to fight back, fight back, must fight back!!! However, the man is not only good at martial arts, but also has many peach blossoms (love affairs). He doesn’t want to be bent by this bastard. Out of thirty-six plans, the best is to get away at once (as long as one is not defeated, there is still a chance).\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Yan, a tangled fellow, pinched his chin and asked; “Yuzhen, how good is it to be the King? ”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to his fingers… “Let me think about it”.\r\n\r\nTurns out that the man whom Emperor Yan called ‘King’ was just his prime minister?!\r\n\r\nBastard, you’re tired of living. How dare you tease this policeman?!\r\n\r\nTsundere Criminal Police Vs Black bellied overbearing Emperor, the counterattack is imminent!>"
