	"description": "The youthful Qin Ye was born almost a century ago, but thanks to immortality granted to him by the ‘fungus of aeons’ he can pass for a high schooler.\n\nHe planned to live an eternal, reclusive life as a happy otaku, enjoying World of Warcraft and his favorite MOBA games, but Fate had other plans in store.  \n\nHell has broken down, and vengeful revenants stalk the mortal realms.  With ghosts running amok throughout all of Cathay, Qin Ye must reluctantly adopt the mantle of ‘hero’ and bring peace to both the living and the dead, while rebuilding Hell.  \n\nBut this, of course, isn’t something a mere Netherworld Operative can do.  For that, he’ll need to become more.\n\nKing Yama is dead.  Long live King Yama!>"
