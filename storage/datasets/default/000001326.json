	"description": "In her previous life, Zhang Yansheng wasted her life because of her scumbag father and stepmother—smoking, drinking, getting tattoos, and drag racing. Reborn back to high school, Yansheng, a rebellious girl, looks at the luxurious mansion and million-dollar cars at home… What's with being rebellious? Isn’t it better to inherit the family business instead?\n\nYansheng is now determined to study hard and be a qualified heir of the family.\n\nWhat about the stepmother and half-brother who are actually devils? What she wasn't able to do in her previous life was to win the fight. So, Yansheng puts an end to her bad demeanor and follows the right path this time.\n\nScumbag Father: I will listen to Yanyan!\n\nHalf-brother: Sister, I won’t dare!\n\nHalf-sister: My sister is the prettiest in the entire universe!\n\nGrandmother: Yanyan is the heir of the family!\n\nThe stepmother, with her precious son, cries bitterly, 'The eldest child is obviously a daughter, so why will she inherit the family's property? I gave birth to a son!'\n\nEveryone says that the prince of the Yue family, Yue Song, is a cold-hearted person, cold as winter. Until that day, someone has seen his gentleness to Yansheng, gentle as water. 'I want to talk to you about marriage between heirs of powerful families.”>"
