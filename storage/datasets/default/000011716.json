	"description": "When the end of the world arrived, our main character was on a ship…\n\nSirens that originally wreaked destruction and brought upon fear in legends, transformed into beautiful, benevolent mermaids in the minds of humans because of fairy tales. The reality was that they preferred to drag humans below the endless, turbulent waves… \n\nLiving in a post-apocalyptic world, there is no guarantee of survival. Waiting for death in a hopeless situation, just as Xia Yi thought that he’d be eaten alive by sea monsters, he encountered an unimaginable event.>"
