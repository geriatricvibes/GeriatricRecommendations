	"description": "She was a showgirl at a bar in modern times, making a clean and honest living, yet enjoyed playing a game of cat-and-mouse.\n\nOne morning she crossed-over, turning into a lamb waiting to be slaughtered at a brothel in ancient times.\n\nWhat a joke! Who is she! How could she get trampled on? With her skills, she ought to be the one doing the slaughtering.>"
