She only had one chance to capture the man in her sights.\n\nAt the Royal Ball, armed with a love potion that could manipulate body and mind, she aimed for a quiet and somber earl.\n\nAlas! \n\nInstead, the King, Ernest, drank the fruit wine she had dosed with the potion, and then confessed his love for her before the guests of the ball! He proposed to her under the spell of the love potion, and became rather forceful!\n\nIs what was to follow, a sweet married life, or was it to be tainted by lies?>"
