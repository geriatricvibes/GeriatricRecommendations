From the eighteenth liner artist, he became a transparent cannon fodder who was blinded and crippled and died miserably in the end.\n\nTo change his miserable fate, Yuan Xi decided to get some financial compensation for his traumatic experience and then planned to run away.\n\nHowever…\n\nYuanxi looked at the man standing in front of him and pulled the small bag around him.\n\n'Brother, just let me go.'\n\nSomeone looked down at the little guy who was about to run away: 'No.'\n\nThe male protagonist just got home: 'Brother, this person is cunning, devious and ruthless, please do not believe anything he says!'\n\nThe male protag’s brother smiled and glanced at his brother: 'Be nice, call him sister-in-law.'>"
