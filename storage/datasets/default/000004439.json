	"description": "Freak Xie Ao Yu originally had no way of cultivating battle qi but, by accident, he got a mysterious godly pellet and he received a supreme emperor blade. That changed his destiny and from then on, he felt the real meaning of life and he made original time and space related battle skills and decisively battled ancient, huge clans and hundreds of continental clans in the Qi Ao continent.\n\nClouds formed with a flip of a hand and rain formed with another flip. He left the strongest mark in tens of thousands of years of history and created glorious chapters about a tyrant’s anger, blood shed for thousands of miles, the skies hissing from mad blades, and the allegiance acknowledgement of all times.>"
