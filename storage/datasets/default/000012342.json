This guy was the one she had a crush on.\n\nBut who was he?\n\nHe didn’t exist yet!\n\nAlisa didn’t meet a boyfriend, she couldn’t even figure out any guy in her life. What if the next guy she met was the killer? It may be an accident or it may be intentional, but he could be the one to do it. She would never know! She didn’t even get the memories of her new life. Unfair!\n\nNow she had to lead a lonely life. She didn’t want to die!
