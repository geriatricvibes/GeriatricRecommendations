	"description": "I have been the Duchess of my quiet and indifferent husband for nine years, but all I received in exchange was contempt and indifference. Not just that, but I was even accused of having a love affair.\n\n'This is my limit of enduring this marriage. No matter how much you cry and plead the Emperor, I can’t stand it anymore!'\n\n'Yes. Do I sign here?'\n\n'So if you pretend to be poor like last time, this time … What?'\n\nI waved divorce papers on an indifferent day. 'I’m done. Can I go now? Oh, and you don’t have to talk about alimony and all that. Just give me back my dowry.'\n\n'What are you gonna do with that little money?' My husband, who had not cared what he had done for the past nine years, finally asked me a question.\n\nI laughed confidently and answered: 'I’m going to open a dessert cafe.'>"
