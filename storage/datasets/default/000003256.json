	"description": "Catching arrows, running up walls, crushing boulders and bending metal, these are but petty parlour tricks in the eyes of martial artists. But where can a genuine martial artist stand in an era where martial artists are nothing more than a myth?\n\nWang Yu, the most peerless martial prodigy the world has ever seen, elopes with his wife to escape an arranged marriage that was set for him as a child. Now aimless and living off his wife, Wang Yu explores the world of “Rebirth,” to seek a living. Rebirth is a world where dragons, demons and immortals are more than just legends, and Wang Yu is set to make a legend of his own.>"
