	"description": "After Ji Xiaotiao, an ordinary girl, was forced to run for a whole block by a handsome stranger, her life ceased to be ordinary.\r\n\r\nHer IQ was 179.99, but she was called a moron. She just wanted to live a regular life, but now it was full of drama. It was one thing to be treated like a maid, but to dress like a guy and audition as his assistant at his private high school? Well, she was so tough now she could deal with whatever happened when it happened.\r\n\r\nXu Moqi didn’t care about Ji Xiaotiao’s internal dialogue as he said, “One final thing you have to remember. Even if you forget who you are, don’t forget about this! Sakura and Maple Leaf are not far apart. We’ll meet again, but pretend you don’t know me!”\r\n\r\nXiaotiao rolled her eyes. Didn’t he just say to pretend to be his maid when they met again? Now they had to pretend they didn’t know each other? You think everyone wants to know you? I wish I could ignore you!>"
