	"description": "Ling Qingxuan, the elder of the cultivation world’s top sect, died. Dying in the most dubious way, she was bonded to a system that calls itself Hei Pizhu (Black-skinned pig- sounds similar to HAPPY pig). \n\n“Dear host, system number ZZ at your service, completing the mission will allow you to be revived~!” \n\nLing Qingxuan: “No.” She already lived for thousands of years, she was sick of living, can't it just directly destroy her body? \n\n“Ok host, let’s begin our mission~~” \n\nThe emotionless her who lived for thousands of years is now forced to accept the mission of un-blackening the villain. Thus, Ling Qingxuan started her journey on this ….increasingly more and more troubling path.\n \nLing Qingxuan: “ ZZ, why is the villain holding my hand?” \n\nZZ: “ The weather is too cold.”  \n\nLing Qingxuan: “ZZ, why is the villain hugging me?” \n\nZZ: “The weather is too cold.”\n \nLing Qingxuan : “ZZ, the villain pulled me under the covers, has the weather been very cold recently?” \n\nZZ: “Oh gosh! Villain, I'm warning you to be nice!”>"
