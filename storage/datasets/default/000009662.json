	"description": "Why was her fate so rough?\n\nEverything has turned disastrous.\n\nShe, a high-flying working girl, has transmigrated into black charcoal.\n\nIn addition, a completely unfavoured Empress!\n\nThat pervert Emperor can go to hell!\n\nNo matter what life, men were to lick her toes.\n\nWant her to serve a man? Dream on!\n\nBut, she didn’t expect the Emperor to be handsome and seductive.\n\nShe wasn’t interested in one moment but rolling with him in the next.\n\nBut his acceptance level is high, that he can chew on a piece of charcoal.\n\nAnd she doesn’t mind reciprocating since he is the meal.\n\nBut this ancient man sees her as a new toy.\n\nDid he think that by having her body he could have her heart?\n\nAlthough she is now an ancient person herself, she has long decided she would not spend the rest of her life in the harem.\n\nHow could she let herself become a poor woman waiting for a man to occasionally bestow her with his favors…\n\n—\n\n1st book in Yuan Yuan’s series 老梗也是梗系列之(AKA We were supposed to have died in a plane crash, instead we transmigrated). The stories consist of three modern settings and three historical.\n>"
