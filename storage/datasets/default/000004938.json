	"description": "She gets drunk in the bar and accidentally offends her husband whom she has rarely met throughout their two-year-marriage! Rumor has it that Young Master Rong Yan is a germaphobe and will never let any woman get near him. Why is she an exception? Rumor has it that Young Master Rong Yan is ill-tempered and whoever offends him, would be sent to meet Hades. But why is she still in one piece after provoking him? She would definitely make those who bully her and treat her unfairly, pay the consequences for their actions!\n\n\n“Little Custard’s Home Rules”\n\n\n“Rule No. 1: You may hug a pretty woman but you can’t get intimate with them!”;\n\n\n“Rule No. 2: If you’re displeased with me, you may raise your objections or make suggestions, but you’re not allowed to resort to violence!”>"
