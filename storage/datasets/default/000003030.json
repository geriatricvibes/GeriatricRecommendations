	"description": "In this world, there is the beautiful mutual and telepathy love.\n\n“I’ve been pursuing you for so long, what do you think?’\n\nXu Xu could feel her heart pounding in her chest; however what he said wasn’t logical.\n\n“You’re pursuing me?”\n\nJi Bai raised his black eyes looking at her quietly.\n\n“Every morning I exercised with you, personally taught you how to shoot, prompted the police team to call you sister in law… If this isn’t pursuing, then what is it?”\n\nShe took a deep breath stabilizing her heartbeat.\n\n“You don’t need to pursue me anymore.”\n\nJi Bai totally did not expect her to say that. His heart sank, coldly said: “What do you mean?”\n\nXu Xu looked into his eyes: “I also like you so you don’t need to pursue.”>"
