	"description": "Qiao Nan: Crap! I am your biological daughter, yet I am treated as if I was picked up from the streets. In fact, you treat me worse than that!\r\n\r\nMother Qiao: Qiao Nan, you are not as pretty or smart as your elder sister. You are not as blessed as her. You have no right to study, marry, or to have your happiness! \r\n\r\nQiao Nan: Why am I not allowed to study, marry, or to seek my happiness? I will find a man right now and marry him! \r\n\r\nQiao Nan is dumbstruck upon discovering that the man right beside her is a powerful figure in the quad—the person who has the most promising prospects to be the future Chief. \r\n\r\nQiao Nan stares at the well-built man in front of her. He has firm abs and cold, chilling eyes. She swallows the lump in her throat as she says her greetings, 'Good Morning, Chief!'>"
