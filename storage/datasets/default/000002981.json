	"description": "Xiao Qing makes a solemn vow in front of  her good friends. If she gets married,  it will not be with some hot stock with momentum just to rise rapidly. Rising so quickly will certainly not last long. \n            Neither will she marry an unpopular stock that has been falling. If you wait until all hair on your head had become white but still you have not risen, you will find that you have no qualms   to jump from the top of a building.\n                     \n Better to wait to find a potential stock with good and bright future prospects. However, it is very difficult to find a potential stock, so Xiao Qing has no qualms about wandering the world, marriage completely out of mind.\n\nOne day, she meets a potential stock who suddenly says he wants to marry her.\n\nXiao Qing says that marriage is just like dying. “I am still too young, I do not want to sleep in a tomb this early.”\n\nThe potential stock says,  “A person ultimately has to die once. Early demise, early reincarnation.”\n\nIn short, this is an out of line woman meeting a belly black (fu hei) male, an inevitable clash between opposing factions and an accident arising from many causes… first comes marriage then the love story.>"
