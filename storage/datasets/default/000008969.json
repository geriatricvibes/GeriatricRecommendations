	"description": "I possessed the ex-wife of the obsessive male lead, a duke who was without a successor.\r\n\r\nI had just planned to quietly pass my days and smoothly get divorced…\r\n\r\n…but a problem occurred.\r\n\r\n“I already said that I didn’t need these sort of things.”\r\n\r\nMy husband stared at me as he tore up our divorce papers.\r\n\r\nRaw emotions stirred from him, who always had a cold expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“For the sake of conceiving a successor, you should also start afresh quickly…”\r\n\r\n“Successor?”\r\n\r\nMy husband hugged me tighter.\r\n\r\n“Are you perhaps saying that you want to try sleeping with me, just once?”\r\n\r\n“But we’re already sleeping in the same bed...”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that.”\r\n\r\nHis gaze that skimmed over my lips was strange.\r\n\r\n“Right, the two of us, we’ve never slept together before, have we?”>"
