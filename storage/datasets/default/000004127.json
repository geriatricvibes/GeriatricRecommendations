	"description": "On the day before his college graduation, Bai Fan’s ordinary life took an unexpected turn. Every night, he would  possess an abused child from the past. Gradually, he found out that the child’s soul was still there, but the child would only regain consciousness during the day, and the two could not directly contact each other. They rely on writing letters to exchange information, and support each other to go through difficulties. In a blink of an eye, ten years passed, the former child had grown into the leader of the Black Moon Sect. They are still living the day and the night separately. Bai Fan doesn’t know that the mind of the former child who never met him is gradually becoming twisted.\r\n\r\nHe hates the injustice of God, he is never going to be able to meet the person he loves. Everyone around him can touch the one they love. He is the only one who has never heard his voice nor his smile. He can only suppress his jealousy. He can only know about him from other people. They are very close, but also very far apart, same as the distance between day and night.>"
