	"description": "The Panthernon's Emperor Jed ldnis was a monarch with an absolute imperial power which scared everyone with his fierce and cruel temper. However, for many women in the empire, it was a lifelong dream to be his woman. His harem castle was already full of such people. Then one day, a forgotten princess, who had been taken prisoner from a small kingdom he conquered, stared at him. The ordinary girl, who stood among those shining with gorgeous appearances, caught his gaze.\r\n\r\n -What is your wish?\r\n\r\n -To live. I wish to live for a long time.>"
