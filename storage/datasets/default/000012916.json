	"description": "I am, a mob character\r\n\r\n\r\nThe me who has memories of her past life got transmigrated into the world of an R18 otome game. The one I transmigrated into however, was no heroine nor villainess but a nameless mob in the game.\r\n\r\nI rejoiced not being the quirky heroine or villainess ends with death but, this world… is somewhat weird.>"
