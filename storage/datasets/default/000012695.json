She tried to love the people around her all her life, but she was betrayed and sacrificed to the devil. Thus, she suffered in hell for 600 years.\n\nAnd then, one day…\n\n'Do you want revenge?'\n\n'If you wish, I will send you back to when you were at your brightest moment.'\n\nThe devil’s whisper came. And, Estelle, who took the devil’s hand, returned back from hell. \n\nA lady of the greatest family of the Empire. \n\nThe Young Lady of Garnet will bring cruel ruins to all those who betrayed her.\n\n“I’ll take everything away from my enemies, and end them in the worst ways possible.”>"
