	"description": "Xia Xixi has a boyfriend named Li Quyin who looks exactly like the movie emperor Shen Bailou.\n\nHe and Shen Bailou are half-brothers from the same father but different mother. Their father does not love Li Quyin’s mother. So, their lives are particularly miserable. Shen Bailou never even mentioned that he had such a brother.\n\nXia Xixi felt that Shen Bailou was a dog in the human face, in fact a scum tr*sh.\n\nLi Quyin was different from him. He was kind, gentle and considerate. Although he was occasionally a little domineering and strong, he was a perfect boyfriend material.\n\nXia Xixi: My boyfriend is a little pitiful.\n\nLi Quyin (black card in my hand suddenly feels non-cost efective. jpg): Yeah √ I eat one meal a day. I’m really pitiful.\n\nXia Xixi: It is very hard for my boyfriend to move bricks on the construction site every day.\n\nLi Quyin (change into construction site suit.jpg): Buy this construction site, I will move bricks from tomorrow!\n\nXia Xixi: I hate Shen Bailou the most, that tr*sh!\n\nLi Quyin (I’m wronged I’m wronged.jpg): Yes, I hate that tr*sh Shen Bailou the most.\n\nReal . Li Quyin . Shen Bailou (smoking melancholy. jpg): Did I just made fun of myself again ?\n\nLi Quyin: Yes √>"
