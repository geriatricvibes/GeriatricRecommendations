	"description": "A modern Japanese man reincarnated into a game as Welner von Zeavert. Though he reincarnated as a noble’s son, he is neither the main character nor the hero of this world. He become someone who didn’t even appear in the game.\r\n\r\nPlus, with only [Spearmanship] as his skill, he can’t even join the hero party to clear main story.\r\nHis small advantages are the fact that he became the hero’s friend and his father’s rather high status. He’s nothing but a supporting character of the story.\r\n\r\nHe noted the game story that he knew from his past life, used it, along with his authority and influence as a noble, to survive from demon king army.\r\n\r\nBut, without realizing it, the knowledge from his past life and his memories of the game story affected the world. He saved people that should have died and took care of events that didn’t appear in the game.\r\n\r\nWith that, he carved history of this world\r\n\r\nThis is not a story about the hero. This is a story about struggle and effort of a young noble.>"
