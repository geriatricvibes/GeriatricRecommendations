	"description": "Living for the forest, I’m happy when glory approaches. Living for precious herbs, I’m lavish when brandishing greens.\r\n\r\nEven if I’m a root of a small herb, I do not need to be envious of the big imposing tree, towering to the sky. I can still grow vibrant.\r\n\r\nA Druid’s mind, that is my nature.>"
