I am breaking my engagement with you.'\r\n\r\nIt seems that villain girls are meant to be left alone, after all.\r\n\r\nI've always liked him, His Highness Charles, since before.\r\nEven if I knew he was just a game character, I still thought of him as someone precious.\r\nEven though I didn't want you to deny this feeling at least.\r\n\r\nThe reason for breaking the engagement was 'true love.'>"
