	"description": "Cecil Rheinett, the daughter of the Earl Family with silver hair and ruby eyes.\n\nShe always gave a cold impression to people, but a lot of people were attracted by her beautiful appearance and her personality, and because of that she was popular among the social circles. This person had a twin little sister.\n\nThe little sister had peculiar black hair and conspicuous glasses.\n\nShe had a very cute face, but her body was weak since she was little. Therefore, she did not have the chance to be in social circles many times. She became an introverted person and had no friends.\n\nThat person hated her elder sister who was popular in the social circles but was being talked from the back (that was what she thought).\n\nHer elder sister was just a stimulus for her complex.\n\nAnd the one who comforted the little sister was the fiancé of the elder sister, Michael Milohite, and her real mother.>"
