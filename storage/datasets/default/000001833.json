	"description": "Xia Liang remembered the first time they met, she nodded to him but he coldly turned his eyes away.  But after she had heard his voice, she helplessly became his diehard fan. Song Qiyan remembered the first time they met, she nodded to him but he tightly held his sweaty palms and turned his eyes away. He feared that she would be burned by his gaze.  He thought that it was time to act after waiting for a year. In Xia Liang’s eyes, Song Qiyan was first known as “Bei Yan Dada”.  After she interacted with him, she had to add additional new labels: quiet, caring, stubborn, reserved...Then after they started dating: thoughtful, loyal, occasionally naïve, childish...\n\nThis is the story of a lesser internet CV (Character Voice-over) who meets a big idol in the professional voice over circle.\n\nNote: 大大, “dada,” is web slang for “the great”.>"
