	"description": "“This world is actually an otome game.”\r\n\r\nOn a certain day, Shiori was told an outrageous fact by her cousin, Kazuto. It turns out he has memories of his past life and his little sister then had played this certain otome game. The heroine in the game would capture hot-looking guys one after another in the school Shiori’s attending. And it turns out Kazuto was one of the capture targets! He asks Shiori to stop the heroine from capturing him.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Shiori runs left and right in the academy since the very first day, searching for the heroine’s whereabouts and her next movement. However, it seems Shiori is also triggering events one after another just like the heroine…!?>"
