	"description": "Many people thought that the sweet-looking second miss of the Gu Family must be a gentle, kind and soft person.\n\nYet sometimes, the truth was in the hands of the few.\n\nThis is a story of a tyrant flower in the guise of a delicate flower and a seemingly sickly but extremely long-lived and infatuated emperor.\n\nThe infatuated emperor’s each day: spoil the tyrant flower, and take care of government affairs along the way.\n\nIn truth, this is a sweet story.>"
