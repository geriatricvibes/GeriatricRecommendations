This is my 10th life!”\nShe’s an illegitimate princess who was misunderstood for having the same blood as the enemy country and got killed early. After nine tragic repeats, she finds out who her father is. Phaeon, a war hero and the strongest knight on the continent who defeated the devil.\nHe had me during a forbidden love with the princess and left me!\nIn order to survive the harsh life of the Royal Palace, I decided to take advantage of this ill-tempered father and throw him away after. Don’t you think I’ll be like your heir, the caretaker that watches over your health, and the knights who follow you like a puppy!\nI’m going to become the strongest and escape this sick country as soon as possible!\nLeo, the son of the enemy country’s king, whom I met while growing up. I wasn’t eluding my dad, but he was pitiful for living confined as a hostage.\n“Asha, you shouldn’t be engaged to anyone.”\n“What? Why?”\n“I have to take responsibility for you for the rest of my life.”\n“What?”\n“We’ve been together for the night.”\nWhat is this prince talking about…? The prince of the enemy country tries to commit a forbidden love!\nCan the unlucky princess change her fate?>"
