	"description": "I’m a combatant for an Evil Organization. I was ordered by the top brass to seduce our enemy, the hero. But I’m just an underling? And it’s absurdly scary to be in contact with the hero!! \n\nCan the combat android made by an Evil Organization, Hiroto, safely (?) lure in the hero who boasts of overwhelming strength, Akkad? \n\nAt the end of the day, this is a Mad Scientist plot. The world’s actual state is…\n\nHero of Justice X Evil Organization Underling. I accidentally made this a story about the not-too distant future. The story proper is in the perspective of a carefree bottom, but there will also be the top’s perspective of the serious underlying situation. The top’s perspective may have your heart hurting, depending on the person. \n\nI just stuffed in everything I like, so I’m sharing it with everyone. Take a look if you’d like.>"
