	"description": "Midnight, the moon is bright, the stars sparse, and all is quiet.\n\nA lone pear blossom is in half bloom before the window, its covert fragrance gushing with words unspoken.\n\nThe wind is cold. The eyes of the one in the yard are also cold.\n\n……\n\nI wanted to perish together, yet who would’ve thought we’d return together, hand in hand.\n—\n\nReturn Together is the last book in Yu Xiao Lan Shan’s Jianghu/Strategy series. It takes place right after The Bandit’s Strategy, after the gang has settled into their new lives in the Imperial Capital. Lu Zhui is the protagonist. Each book is standalone, but there are character cameos and mentions that don’t disrupt the flow of the main story of each book. >"
