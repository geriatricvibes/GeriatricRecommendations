	"description": "'I have not committed a single crime. And I think I can prove that I am innocent.' \r\nA letter was discovered in the room of a suspect after he had been released from juvenile prison. And shortly following this discovery,  a message was found written on the wall at a crime scene: 'I am innocent.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at an editorial department for the gossip magazine Last Week Weekly, the editor-in-chief Rui Otonobe - alias Otsuberu - is approached by a mysterious, daunting man with a scar running across his face named Yukihiro Kisa as a new reporter for the magazine company Iibane Publications. As the two try and find the latest scoop, Kisa and Otonobe find themselves in the web of serial killings and corruption.>"
