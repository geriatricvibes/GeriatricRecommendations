I'll give this body to protect you.'\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, I am going to help the innocent Duke adapt to Korea......\r\n\r\n'Are you going to abandon me now?'\r\n\r\n'Who's throwing you away? You must have adjusted here now, so you should move out.'\r\n\r\n'What did I do wrong? I'll correct everything. Please, give me one more chance.'\r\n\r\nThe duke, who said he had to go back to his world, suddenly became obsessed.>"
