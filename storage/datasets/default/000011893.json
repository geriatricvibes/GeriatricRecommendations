	"description": "Mahiro is the prince of the Mismarca Kingdom, he won’t study nor learn swordsmanship, he is a lazy prince who only plays around. His Royal Guard Pariel would always scold him for his behavior.\n\nAnd towards that Mismarca Kingdom an elite squadron of the Gran Marsenal Empire is approaching. Their leader is Lunas, a warrior princess, the Third Imperial Princess.\n\nAll of Mismarca’s vassals voiced their will to fight to make a last stand. But, there is one man who cowardly asks, “Why don’t we have a talk with them?”\n\nWhat kind of fate awaits the Mismarca Kingdom and its useless Prince, Mahiro?>"
