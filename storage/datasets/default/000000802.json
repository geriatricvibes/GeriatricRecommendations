However, due to an uncommon mistake on my part, I returned home in a hurry and heard a loud noise coming from my room, so I hurriedly entered my room. I entered the room to find the two of them talking about something different than usual, like 'Insects...' and so on. I was too carefree to notice anything, but Kanade sensed the discomfort clearly.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a childhood friend and best friend who betrayed me and another childhood friend who saved me.>"
