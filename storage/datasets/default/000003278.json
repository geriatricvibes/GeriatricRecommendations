	"description": "Peach farmer Toru discovers a sweet-smelling, golden peach. It's a peach sprite who's fallen from Heaven. It turns into a beautiful, golden-haired boy, whom Toru decides to call Momo, and enjoys a naivee life in the world below. Toru looks after him, awkwardly, clumsily, but gently, and the pure-hearted Momo manages to get their feelings to connect, but theirs is a forbidden love-- Includes their after story, and the heart-wrenching love story of the unripe peach sprite Komomo, who falls in love with Lord White Tiger.>"
