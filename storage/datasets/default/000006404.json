	"description": "She fell into a novel.\nIf she can find true love, then she’d be able to have a happy ending.\nHowever, after the story reached its end, what greeted her was death.\nAnd when she opened her eyes once more, she returned to the very same beginning.\nShe fell in love yet again,\nBut the ending was, still, death.\n\nPoison… strangulation… illness… falling… being crushed… burned alive… starved to death…\n\nAs she welcomed her 117th birthday,\nCarynne Hare decided to become a murderer.>"
