	"description": "Xia Xingcheng, with average acting skills and appearance, had been a small star in the entertainment industry for six years. But one day, a famous director invited him to act in a gay movie titled “Gradual Distance” with numerous award-winning movie emperor Yang Youming. In the movie, they had a sweet love; out of it, there was polite coldness. In the movie, they had a sad ending; out of it, there were ambiguous feelings. The contrast between what was in the movie and what was outside of it often made Xia Xingcheng unable to find himself. Because of Yang Youming’s guidance, he had stepped into the ranks of actors, but also because of Yang Youming, he couldn’t distinguish between what was reality and what wasn’t.\r\n\r\nXia Xingcheng didn’t expect that the movie would finally push him into the abyss of pain and happiness.>"
