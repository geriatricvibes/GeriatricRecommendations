	"description": "Most female leads in historical romance novels live through miserable experiences. They’ll always be misunderstood, betrayed by their family, misunderstood by their lovers, bullied by their mothers-in-law, framed by their rivals… \n\nThey’ll always be kind, forgive those who betray them, fall in love with someone who repeatedly hurts them, treat their evil mothers-in-law and their rivals’ children as their own, before finally obtaining their happy ending.\n\nWhen Su Yuan became the female lead of such a novel: I have something to say… I’m not sure whether it’s appropriate or not.>"
