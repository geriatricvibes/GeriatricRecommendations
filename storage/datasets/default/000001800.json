	"description": "I entered my favorite romance-fantasy novel, which I have read many times. \n\nThanks to the body of a wealthy commoner, I bought the status of a fallen aristocrat, attended a noble family’s gathering and observed the romance of the characters in the original novel. \n\nI wanted to return to the real world after witnessing the ending. \nBut somehow, even after the ending, I was not freed from the body I possessed and remained living in the original novel. \n\nAs a result, I acquired the stories behind the scenes that I refused to comprehend. \n\nMy favorite sub male lead, Caelus, has died.\nLiving impoverished in the original work without him, I eventually fell ill and died. \nNow, I wanted to return to reality. \n\nHowever, the irony of fate has returned me to the end of the novel overnight. This is definitely… to save my beloved, right?>"
