	"description": "The world I reincarnated in is a relatively modern era where wars are fought with line infantry.\r\n\r\nAs a Commoner Second Lieutenant, I'm labelled as a 'Death God' and ostracized, and posted to the all women Sixth Special Brigade to serve as a Strategist.\r\n\r\nThe Brigade Commander with hidden intentions, and the clueless Sergeants are all women. Naturally, the troopers are all girls.\r\n\r\nIf this goes on, everyone will die in battle. I need to do something... But what exactly?!>"
