He is amazed that his little body can jump a few meters with a casual leap. One day, when System is having fun in the forest, a leaf falls from its branch. Autumn has come, and System's time is ticking away. \r\n\r\nSystem needs to lengthen his short lifespan and survive in the Forest of Leyte. Luckily, he finds a way to manipulate an army of ants and now they are at his disposal... to fight bigger prey.>"
