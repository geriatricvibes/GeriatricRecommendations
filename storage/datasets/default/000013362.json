	"description": "He is a strange and suspicious man.\r\n\r\nHe is the Director of the best advertising company who dominates the field and is famous for being known as an absolute powerhouse.\r\n\r\nHe is a man with an unrealistic appearance, enough to make people go crazy. His low and husky voice also added to his charm.\r\n\r\nBut why is such a man who has never been tempted by women, making such a proposal to me, an actress who has stayed unknown for 8 years and could hardly get cast in an audition.\r\n\r\n“So now… Are you offering to be my sponsor?”\r\n\r\n'Isn't this a desperate situation for you now?'\r\n\r\n100 days of living together. A relationship is a must. The price is guarantee of success.\r\n\r\nA sponsor offer that is quite obvious to anyone.\r\n\r\nBut why me?\r\n\r\n'You're saying I'm your type?”\r\n\r\n'Why can't you believe me?'\r\n\r\n'I can't believe.. you of all the people would have your eyes on a woman.'\r\n\r\n'What's wrong about my eyes?'\r\n\r\nIt's clear that he's not interested in the opposite sex and his clumsy reasons are even more incredible.\r\n\r\nI wonder who this suspicious man is.\r\n\r\n'If I tell you the truth... Will you believe me?'\r\n\r\nUnbelievable words came out from this suspicious man's mouth which changed my whole life...>"
