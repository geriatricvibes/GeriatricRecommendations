	"description": "As a grand duchess with a body like glass, I lost my life in a severe seizure. \n\nNo, rather, I thought I had lost it. \n\n“…I want you.” \n\nThen, I was reincarnated as a woman who looked just like me.\n\nHowever, isn’t this woman’s body too healthy?\n\nThe joy of having a healthy body is brief, everyone says this to me this.\n\nBecause this woman is my perfect husband’s mistress.\n\nI attended my own funeral in order to hear the truth.\n\nI saw a handsome man there, crying even more than my own husband, as if the world had suddenly collapsed.\n\nWho is that man, who I’ve never seen before?\n\nAnd actually, this woman…\n\n…Is she my husband’s mistress?>"
