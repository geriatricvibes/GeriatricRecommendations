	"description": "In the year 2041, a miraculous instrument emerges, known to professional insiders as the Projector. \n\nIt can link to a human’s thoughts, project the complex thoughts into a bizarre actual space. This space can be stable or unstable. All laws of physics are meaningless; all weird things can happen. \n\nAccordingly, a whole new type of psychologist appears. Using the altered space, they put themselves into the thought projection space, going in depth into the origins of the patient’s illness amid dangers. \n\nAccordingly…this is a cheerful adventure story.>"
