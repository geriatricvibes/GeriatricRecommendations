	"description": "Before the novel's ending, I possessed a supporting character. Now, I am the younger sister of a villainess soon to die, two months until the execution. While visiting my elder sister, I often visited the rest of the villains.\n\n'Didn’t you get better?'\n'... What?'\n\nIn the prison I often visited to see my sister, the novel's villains started looking at me.\n\n'I'm asking if this wasn’t acting. Answer me, Margaret Eilish.'\n\nThe man's words were beyond my expectations in such a dangerously intimate atmosphere.\n\nI looked at the man from afar.\n\nGet a hold of yourself, Margaret.\n\nNothing good will come out of revealing my illness in front of the guard.\n\nI whispered back with a little confusion, pretending to know nothing.\n\n'... Tell me what you mean. I'll listen to you calmly.'>"
