	"description": "The only thing scary about someone with hemophobia is a vampire with hemophobia. \n\nAs a skilled Emergency Department doctor, Doctor Shang meets a series of abnormal non-human races such as a werewolf with pet allergies, an elf who sings out of tune, a highly myopic celestial master, an incubus who doesn’t like girls, a baby dragon who is afraid of heights, and a vampire with hemophobia.\n\nHe opens the door to a new world, heals and saves people, subdues demons, eliminates devils, and every day his only goal is to get his boyfriend to drink blood. To help his domestic vampire overcome hemophobia, Doctor Shang has thought of many ways: bottles, blindfolds, handcuffs, and food coloring.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these solutions worked.\n\nSo – in the end, Doctor Shang could only chase after his vampire, bitterly rolling up his sleeves at him, “Try biting me one more time! Just one bite!>"
