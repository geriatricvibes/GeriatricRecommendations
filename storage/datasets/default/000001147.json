	"description": "Third Master Jiang is known to bring misfortune to his wives. All his fiancées were not spared from mishaps. In Gu Xiang’s case, it's worse because she registered the marriage with him right away without getting engaged. Surprisingly, her life is smooth sailing after the marriage and she is extremely favored by all members of the Jiang family. Everyone from the family is fearless. Yet, their only fear is that their daughter-in-law, who joins the family after much painstaking efforts, would escape. On a certain night after washing up, Mr. Jiang says to his dearest wife, “Darling, I want to become a father.” \r\n\r\nSeeing the look of anticipation on Doctor Jiang’s face, Gu Xiang hesitated and replies with much difficulty, \r\n\r\n“Daddy!” \r\n\r\n“…” \r\n\r\nIt is not always so peaceful between Gu Xiang and Doctor Jiang. In order to repay gratitude owed to her stepfather, Gu Xiang agreed to an unusual deal. Just like this, two complete strangers, who are at odds from the start, are forced to live together. Amidst all their squabbles and pressure from the elders to conceive a child, they find their relationship evolving as they care more for each other.>"
