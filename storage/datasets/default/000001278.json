	"description": "A novelization of the game, Zero Escape: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, with some slight difference.\r\n\r\nThe story follows Junpei who was abducted and placed aboard an empty, sinking cruise liner along with eight other people. The cruise liner resembles the RMS Titanic, a ship which killed over 1500 in the early 20th century. The nine people were forced to participate in the 'Nonary Game', a deadly game which involves numerical bracelets, small bombs in each player's stomach that will detonate and kill them if they disobey, exploring the ship and solving escape-the-room puzzles in order to survive and escape before they drown in 9 hours. The players also attempt to find out why they were kidnapped.>"
