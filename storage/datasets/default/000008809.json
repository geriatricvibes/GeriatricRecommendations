	"description": "Inutil, who is abused by her mother Harvey daily, refuses to view the outside world.\r\n\r\nShe is rescued one day by Roshan Samuel, who appears to be her biological father, and is given the name Lucia Samuel.\r\n\r\nLucia gradually stopped refusing to see it in front of her as she became familiar with a new world she had never known before.\r\n\r\n'Lucia Samuel is your name. I'm not sure what was named previously, but I keep forgetting everything and having to start over.'\r\n\r\nI've never had such a tickling feeling before.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I was tickled as much as I was thrilled when I first saw her mother's gorgeous smile.\r\n\r\n'Please don't deny my feelings...' \r\n\r\nArne, who protects Lucia and shows unknown feelings, and those who are walking the path of regret in the past they are unaware of.\r\n\r\nWill she have the opportunity to choose a happy ending in this life?>"
