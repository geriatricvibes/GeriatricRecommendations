	"description": "All Yukari Morita wanted to do was find her father on the little island where he disappeared to - an island where they frequently test rockets. Suddenly, though, on a path in the forest, a strange man in strange vehicle picks her up, saying it's dangerous there. One thing leads to another and Yukari finds herself forced to become an astronaut for the Solomon Space Agency.>"
