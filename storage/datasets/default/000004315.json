	"description": "[Just as your birth didn’t inspire me, your death won’t mean anything to me.]\nJayna reincarnated as a supporting character who was born as mixed blood of human-dragon and died miserably after being neglected. \n\nShe is branded as an unclean entity and was abandoned by the dragons.\n\nAnd the first time she met her father, the lord of the tower, Diamide, he just looked at her coldly, as though he didn’t feel any sense of intimacy to his daughter as described in the original.\n\n“Is that the one you called my daughter?”\n\nJayna flinched as he approached and lowered her sight.\n\n“Blue eyes… but that’s not a proof that she’s my daughter. You could have brought me a child born with another human.”\n\nAnd so he went back leaving her alone and Jayna was living in the shabby warehouse of the tower.\n\nRather than making vain efforts to get into the eyes of her father, the lord of the tower, she decided to have a small luxury that she had never experienced even in her previous life before her death.\n\n“You don’t have to think of me as your daughter. I won’t call you ‘Father’ either.”\n\n“…”\n\n“Tower lord?”\n\nSo why is the father, who should’ve been indifferent, starting to get obsessed?\n\nFather, can you just leave me alone?>"
