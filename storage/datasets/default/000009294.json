	"description": "She became a mermaid after getting stuck in a game?!!\n\nIn order to see the end of the game, I must marry the prince…\n\nBut if the prince is gay, what the hell do I do?\n\nIn the midst of constant game overs and seemingly endless regressions, the woman who had become a knight stepped into her 6th round.\n\n“Please stay still, little brother.”\n\n“…”\n\n“Is it because the swordsman arrived so soon? At this rate, I’ll think I’m actually gay.”\n\nA man who is, in fact, not gay, and a woman who is growing weary of repeated deaths.\n\nIn a world finally advancing towards its completion, a romance fantasy where a true ending can be witnessed.>"
