	"description": "Is this person living?\r\n\r\nOn the day of highschool enrollment, her maturity amidst the common people had left a deep impression on me.\r\n\r\nTo possess an extraordinary presence that hardly anyone in the big city would be able to ignore, however none could think of touching that girl—- Mayu Kurosaki.\r\n\r\nIn the process of preparing for the school opening ceremony, by chances, my several chat with her served as a turning point.\r\n\r\nKurosaki little by little began to integrate into the entire class.\r\n\r\nYet just as before, inside her existed a gap, a shadow that we had yet to realize….\r\n\r\nBut I, still wished for the time that I can be at her side.>"
