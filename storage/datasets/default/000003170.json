	"description": "The mountain was once home to a dragon with fiery red eyes and a red mane.\n\nIts breath scorched the forest, its claws cut through the rocky skin of giants, and its fangs devoured even devils with horns and wings.\n\nOne night, the soul of a sobbing child wandered to the dragon and settled on it.\n\nThe dragon, with its power approaching that of a god, is undaunted and will not yield to anyone.\n\nHowever, the red dragon knew nothing of how to protect those who were much weaker than it, or how to hold on to the life that was dying. >"
