	"description": "A Kingdom under war.\r\n\r\nThe 8th Princess of Roymonde, Zelleine, escaped in time amidst the chaos\r\nbut she woke up in a bird’s body instead of a princess’s?\r\n\r\n‘Gweeckkk’\r\n\r\nWhat is this? What is this animal’s sound?\r\n\r\nEven worse, the bird she was “transmigrated” into is the messenger falcon of the bloodless and tearless General ‘Valhayle’.\r\n\r\nShe starts a journey for her country and to find her real body but she keeps getting involved with the General and a red warning sign flashes in her life.\r\n\r\nHuman or bird, life is hard.>"
