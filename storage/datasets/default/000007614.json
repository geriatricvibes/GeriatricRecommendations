The exchanging of anonymous fan letters with his favorite author was his only joy, but...\n\nHe had a workload that never seemed to diminish and a very coldblooded and strict Chancellor.\n\nA cousin, that was a Duke who threw away his common sense and temper and always got into trouble.\n\nThe strongest knight of the North that fell victim to the Duke’s fervent love.\n\nAnd a flippant prince of a neighboring country that was dragged to the Kingdom only to be the Duke’s floormat.\n\nWill His Majesty be able to break through all these obstacles and succeed in both fanboying and dating with his favorite author?\n\nA bestseller romance novel author that is like a snow rabbit and the straightforward but pathetic Emperor. The two single-all-their-life’s romance story!>"
