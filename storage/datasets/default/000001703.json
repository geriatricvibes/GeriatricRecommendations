	"description": "In this country, there was a man called the 【Hero of Rodell】 before. He overwhelmed his enemies with a strength not unlike a fierce god, and it was said that no one can match his sword skills. However, the man unexpectedly concealed his whereabouts and disappeared from the center stage――― then, five years after that.\n\n『I do not plan to wield a sword ever again. I also do not want to kill people. Whatever you expect, it has nothing to do with me.』\n\nWhat appeared before the Crown Prince who put on a mask called 『lie』 to falsify himself is the excessively foul-mouthed 【Hero】.>"
