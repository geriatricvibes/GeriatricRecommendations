	"description": "“I’m the only daughter of Marquis Ian Horissen, right?”\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I found myself inside a novel…not as the female lead, but as a supporting character. \r\n\r\nWho said only the main characters got a happy ending? I’ve decided to choose a new path and take the male lead for myself! \r\nIn the original novel, it would take two and a half years for me to meet him, but I can’t wait that long.\r\n\r\n“Bring me a pen and some paper.”\r\n\r\nI’ll write a letter to him instead. There’s no time to waste—I’ll make sure the sweet and caring male lead is mine!>"
