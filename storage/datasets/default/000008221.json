	"description": "In a quiet corner of the world, the mortal delight you indulged for me is my most romantic of my eternity.\n\nA never-isolated city I received, a mini forever I shall return.\n\n\n                                                          +\n\n\n“Gifting You With a City That Will Never Be Isolated details the romance between an awkward, quiet, introverted and socially handicapped female lead and a good-natured and sweet male lead.\n\nTheir romance, in fact, is a steady stream that flows unnoticed slow if one doesn’t pay attention.\n\nThis novel isn’t the most exciting, nor the most captivating – but it’s a sweet, lovely novel detailing the sweet and ordinary love between two common folks, and perhaps best expresses what healthy, ordinary relationships should aim to be like. It’s a story about growth, about trust, and about how a healthy relationship can really help one to change for the better.”>"
