	"description": "Our protagonist was one day summoned to another world.\n\nThe summoner was a slender young girl who could use magic.\n\nHowever, the fate that awaited him there was not a heroic tale overflowing with hopes and dreams.\n\n“Do I perhaps have the blood of a hero destined to save this world?”\n\n“Bzzt! Nope. Wrong answer! You are a toy with the purpose of being tortured!!”\n\nA story of a slightly dangerous 너 (You)\n\nand a slightly strange 나 (I)\n\nmeeting in a slightly lonely place (Asylum).>"
