	"description": "I accidentally changed the whole world, the resurrection of the dead, genetic variation, recovery of the qi, mountain and seas reborn, land and seas expanded and evil spirits have started to appear.\n\nGhosts are now commonplace. Some people now have three heads and six arms. Some people have obtained martial arts techniques and ordinary people are now just cannon fodder.\n\nFortunately, I have acquired an ability which can make various items mutate. \n\nbooks into martial arts or cultivation manuals,\n\nfruits into precious treasures of heaven and earth or poison that you can only imagine and...\n\nweapons, that can split the earth or gain sentience!>"
