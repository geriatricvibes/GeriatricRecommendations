	"description": "Tatsuya Endou is an ordinary high school student. Speaking of how he is different from people, it's to the extent that he has a non-Japanese grandparent.\n\nOne day, however, it appears he became able to see statuses.\n\nLike that, Tatsuya peeked at the secrets of his classmates, became intimate with his girlfriend, attempted to date, and enjoyed himself in his club activities.\n\nAlthough sub-humans, skills, and magic appeared, he decided to not risk it. There weren’t such things like crises of the world.\n\nA gentle and slightly lewd story.>"
