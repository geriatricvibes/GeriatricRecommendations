	"description": "The female protagonist crossed over to become the Venerable Woman Kingdom’s Crown Princess. That’s right, that’s right, holding power and authority and handsome men!\r\n\r\nWhat? She’s has the body constitution of trash and is unable to practice martial arts?\r\n\r\nHaving finally set her eyes on a good looking man, he turned out to be a snow wolf. Isn’t that just so sad and depressing….. Having captured a good looking man, a certain woman laughed sinisterly. “Remember this. You are already mine, so you have to remain chaste for me. If you do not obey, I will then reject the goods.”\r\n\r\nThe handsome looking man was stunned with his mouth agape. “You….. You’ve gotten it completely backwards!”>"
