	"description": "I possessed an extra whose name wasn’t even mentioned in the romance-fantasy novel I was reading.\n\nTo be precise, it’s the Commander of the Imperial Knights under the direct control of the Emperor and the youngest daughter of the Alfrez Ducal family, she is an extra that has no shame in her wealth, status, and appearance.\n\nI was quite satisfied with possessing such a character, and it was when a boy who seemed to have lost his way in the Imperial Palace started chasing after me.\n\n“Mom.”\n“Pardon…?”\n“Mom! Why are you pretending not to know me!”\n\nI’m sorry, but I’m not your mother…?\nDo I look like this child’s mother?\nAnd his dad is the notorious Evil Duke in the novel?\n\nIt seemed as if a storm suddenly swept through my peaceful daily life.>"
