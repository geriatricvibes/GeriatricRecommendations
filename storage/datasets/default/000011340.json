	"description": "I woke up as the orphaned princess Amelia in a novel! My lovely aunt Lucinda, who suffers from raising me alone, is as kind as an angel.\r\n\r\nThough it doesn't appear so in the eyes of my uncle, tyrant Emperor Tess Illuminas.\r\n\r\n'Auntie, trust in me only! I'll make you walk on a flower path!' Amelia enters the imperial palace only for her aunt. But this uncle doesn't seem like the tyrant in the novel at all? Rather, it just seems like there's a lack of affection?\r\n\r\n'I can't help it! Amelia will make everyone happy!' Nowadays, children play matchmaking as a hobby, right? I'll try it out.>"
