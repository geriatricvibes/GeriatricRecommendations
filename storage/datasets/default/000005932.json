	"description": "A middle-aged engineer who was weary of life ended up being reborn into a different world as Zack, the son of a frontier feudal lord. Once there, he received a mission from God. He was told to prepare himself for the task of “guiding the future hero of the world”. With that in mind, Zack not only trained himself in swordsmanship and magic but also committed himself towards reforming problems in hygiene and education. After developing a new local product, Zack was reminded of his once forgotten dream: brewing alcohol! As he resurrected his long lost passion, it was the beginning of his “Dream Life”.>"
