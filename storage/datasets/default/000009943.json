	"description": "Pei Shiyi, who had been dead for hundreds of years, was suddenly resurrected. He was poor, homeless and was an unregistered resident. In order to settle down, Pei Shiyi took over a cat cafe.\n\nThe cat cafe was poorly managed and on the verge of closing down, there were only two to three real kittens.\n\nPei Shiyi fed the kittens and set a small goal for himself: for example, first, become the best cat cafe in this city. So a year later, a cat cafe called Xian Chan rose to prominence.\n\nThe Jin Hua cat that practiced Daoism for hundreds of years became a fat orange cat.\n\nThe Bi An came here and became a golden British shorthair.\n\nThe lively and active leopard cat was a real leopard.\n\nIt also came with a fluff-obsessed, non-human Director of Administration. After sniffing* the fat orange cat, the leopard cat and the ragdoll, he even began sniffing* Pei Shiyi.\n\nThe fluffy Pei Shiyi, who was a real phoenix: Do you want to die?\n\nDirector Bao: Sniffing cats is fun, sniffing you is addictive.>"
