	"description": "When I finally awoke, I had been reborn as a rabbit.\n\nCarnivores, the enemies of herbivores, didn’t live in my little forest. That’s why I became careless. Carnivores weren’t the only threat. \n\nOne day, all the rabbits in the surrounding forest disappeared, leaving me all alone. Not just the rabbits, either. The entire forest seemed to have vanished,  all the trees and lush grass disappearing without a trace. Only small traces of vegetation were left, scattered around the hole leading to my den.\n\n「A rabbit in a place like this…？」\n\nAs I sat confused, I was picked up by a passing stranger. Tall, tanned, with hard muscles and a tempered body…A huge man picked up a little black rabbit. \n\nHuge! His face is of ikemen class but his eyes are sharp and scary like a carnivore!\n\nA loose love story between a scary, carnivore-looking, mofu-mofu loving king × the black rabbit whose only redeeming feature is its mofu-mofu!>"
