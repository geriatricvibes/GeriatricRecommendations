I will give you money! Am I still allowed to?\n\nThe villain’s lips are smiling, his eyebrows are gentle, and he whispers softly in her ear, “Yaoyao, you must only like me, otherwise I will punish you!”\n\nJi Yao: I…I can not only use money to support you, but I’m also willing to donate my liver!>"
