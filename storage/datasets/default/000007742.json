	"description": "After his death, the business giant Su Rui not only left his business empire to an outsider, but also entrusted his beloved daughter to that person. Su Lingxin really didn’t understand what is so good about that man named Gu Shaoxuan? Domineering, arrogant, and unreasonable, not only did he took everything that was supposed to belong to her, but also acted as if she is part of his possessions! On what basis did he have the right to do that?!>"
