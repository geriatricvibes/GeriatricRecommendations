	"description": "You were simultaneously my most difficult problem, and the one that I wanted to solve the most.\n\n“Why did you have to appear in front of me?”\n\nI summed up my questions about you to one short sentence.\n\nIt was a short question, but it was one that I pondered over constantly. What did I have to do to not know you. What was I supposed to do to know you and not fall for you.\n\nIt was a short question, but I poured countless worries into it. What should I have done to not know you? What should I have done to not fall in love with you, even after knowing you?>"
