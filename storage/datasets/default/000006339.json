	"description": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Rabukome wa Machigatte Iru is a romantic comedy which revolves around antisocial high school student, Hachiman Hikigaya, who has no friends, no girlfriend, and a severely distorted view on life.\r\n\r\nWhen he sees his classmates talking excitedly about living their adolescent lives, he mutters, “They’re a bunch of liars.” When he is asked about his future dreams, he responds, “Not working.” In an attempt to fix Hachiman’s twisted personality, his teacher forces him to join the volunteer ‘service club’, where the only other member happens to be one of the school’s most beautiful and smartest girls, Yukino Yukinoshita.>"
