	"description": "Heeran, the granddaughter of Mazon, lived a life of luxury and enjoyment. One day, she was brutally murdured by her stepmother.\n\n‘Fortunately, I came back.’\n\nA tooth for a tooth. An eye for an eye.\n\nShe dreamed of revenge for her stepmother, saying she would have her pay for her life.\n\n“I’m happy because of you!”\n\nBut she gave up revenge for the nanny who truly cared about her because she thought she wouldn’t be touched if she just lived quietly.\n\nShe believed she could keep this little happiness.\n\n‘But…’\n\n“I guess I looked to easy, nanny.”\n\nHeeran smiled faintly, turning her back to the grave.\n\n“Now it’s time to go back to being a wicked villain.”>"
