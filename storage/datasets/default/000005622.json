	"description": "The Empire’s one and only princess. \n\nShe had everything within her grasp from the moment she was born: a keen intellect, superior talents, even the position as the heir to the throne. One day, before her twentieth birthday, she begins to have dreams. These dreams show her the events that are to happen dozens of years later. She believes this foresight is a blessing from the heavens and is thankful for it. \n\nHowever, the more she dreams, the stranger they become. The future Sienna envisioned was nothing like this. The half-brother she despised has retaliated. Her mother, who Sienna had believed to be her absolute ally, has a hidden agenda. And finally a man who has great influence over her, both in reality and in her dreams, appears before her. \n\nSuddenly, everything around her begins to change, transforming her in the process.>"
