	"description": "　Isn't it sad that I'm in high school and I've never kissed?\r\n \r\n　I'm proud to be a perfectionist and aspire to be a doctor, but I, Kotaro Kuroki, am struggling.\r\n \r\n　Is kissing necessary for a perfect life...? No, love and kissing are confusing to me!\r\n \r\n　Then I met Hino Koyuki, a classmate rumoured to be 'the girl who kisses everyone,' and by chance, I ended up playing a certain game with this girl.\r\n \r\n'Hey, how about I kiss you if I lose?'\r\n \r\n'Geez!'\r\n \r\n'Haha, Kuroki, that's funny... So do you want to?'\r\n \r\n'Who needs a kiss?' I thought, but I couldn't take my eyes off her.\r\n \r\n　I'm sure she has something that I don't, yet why does her smile seem so sad sometimes?\r\n \r\n　--There are many kinds of people in this world: unrealistic, slu*ts, shady, and b*tches.\r\n \r\n　In this world, there are people who suffer from 'being abnormal.'\r\n \r\n　But who in the world has the right to call it a disease?\r\n \r\n　A coming-of-age romantic comedy that goes back to the basics and prescribes for all the misfits!\r\n\r\n>"
