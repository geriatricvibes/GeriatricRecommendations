	"description": "It is said that the ancient mythical beast overlord Pixiu will ward off evil from your home and has an insatiable appetite. Once a thing enters its mouth, it will not come back out.\n\nThe young master of an antiques shop, Du Ziyu, surprisingly has had non-stop luck ever since he obtained the ink jade Pixiu, and also picked up an additional ” x-ray vision” ability, making him rich.\n\nHowever, everything comes with a price. The Pixiu also needs to eat, but it’s spitting out gold, silver, treasures, and jewels. It will only be full from “eating” people.\n\n****************\n\n“If Pixiu don’t eat human food, what do you eat? Real gold and silver?”\n\n“There’s two conditions.”\n\n“There’s conditions for you to eat gold, silver, treasures, and jewels? Under what conditions would you eat stone agate?”\n\n“No…”\n\n“Then what is it?”\n\n“If you’re not here, I’ll eat both gold and jade. If you’re here, I’ll only eat you.”>"
