	"description": "A sudden ‘realization’ renders this little debater speechless.\r\n\r\nQian Wei has been a member of the debate team for two years and has participated in a total of three debates.\r\n\r\nThe first time around, he was so nervous that when he stood up, streaks of light flooded his vision, and he wasn’t even able to get a single word out.\r\n\r\nThe second time around, he was so ‘intimidated’ by his opponent that when the other debater glanced at him, his brain short-circuited and his speech was interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe third time…\r\n\r\nThe third time around, he was so excited he was given the title: “Most Excited Debater.”>"
