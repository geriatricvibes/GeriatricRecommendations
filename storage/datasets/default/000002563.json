	"description": "He cherished her and said, “Silly girl, I will protect you in the future. No one can bully you.”\r\n\r\nHe was the young master of a wealthy family with the legendary royal bloodline passed down through thousands of years. He was like a jade tree, elegant and noble. \r\n\r\nSuch a cold and unfeminine her was the only person he put on the tip of his heart and loved her more than his life.\r\n\r\nShe was a disguised all-rounder Cinderella. Notorious and framed by her sister, she was betrayed by her fiance and plotted against by her family.\r\n\r\nShe was rescued by him in a desperate life or death situation. From then on, her old life ended and she embarked on the road of a peak legend.\r\n\r\nSince disguise couldn’t achieve the peace she wanted, she became a bloodthirsty black-hearted lotus. No longer forbearing, she was beautiful and wild. >"
