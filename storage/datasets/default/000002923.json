	"description": "After transmigrating, Chi Muyao was locked in a ‘small dark room’ aka a cave, with the main villain Xi Huai. The demonic cultivator’s body was chained up and his spiritual energy sealed.\n\nChi Muyao’s situation was…awkward to say the least. He needed to dual cultivate to the Foundation Building Stage in order to lift the restriction on the cave so they could be rescued.\n\nHowever…he’s a male disciple of the He Huan Sect ahhhhhh! Who was he supposed to cultivate with, the main villain??\n\nEveryone who’s read the book he transmigrated into knew that the cannon fodder who used Xi Huai to dual cultivate died an exceptionally terrible death.\n\nRun! He had to skedaddle as soon as the restriction was lifted!>"
