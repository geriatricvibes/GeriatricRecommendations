	"description": "The strongest force in battle x the man on the supreme throne\n\nThis was an era where artificial intelligence determined the direction of human life. The most infamous enemy to the Federation, the supreme commander of the Navi Military Command, Adrian Yate, and the youngest representative councilor of the Supreme Council, Zhong Yan, were matched up by the AI as the most optimal marriage candidates to each other.\n\nIf they reject the AI’s optimal recommendation, they had to pay the fine.\n\nAdrian: Why should I pay? I don’t have money, so scram!\n\nZhong Yan: I don’t have money either.\n\nAI: If the fine is not paid within the time limit, congratulations to your unification.>"
