There were even rumors of her not being a virtuous wife and having illicit affairs with other men. However, she had no such memories. \n\nAfter waking up from a heavy fall and knocked her head, she is now polite, treats people in good faith, and tries her best to get on her husband’s good side. No matter what she did, the past could not be undone and despite having no memories of it, Feng Ning calmly accepts her fate and slowly tries to mend things back. But why must fate be cruel to her? What did she do in the past to deserve this? In the first place, how did she end up in this sorry state?>"
