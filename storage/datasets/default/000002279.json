	"description": "A spinoff alternate universe light novel from the universe of Blazblue. Technically takes place between the third game in the series, Blazblue Chronophantasm and Blazblue Central Fiction, explaining the new character Naoto Kuroganeâ€™s background.  The release dates coincide with this viewing order as well. \n\nThere are two parts, but it is treated as a separated single volume, chapter numbers carrying over between the two novels.>"
