	"description": "Life is just like a tragic comedic drama. After living 23 years in comedy, I suddenly found that the remainder of my life would be lived in tragedy. This all started out in the morning of my first day to work. I warmly greeted that raging leader. After that, my life took a rapid and dramatic change for the worse. Since then, I either accompanied my boss on match-making dates or kept him company on his journey to get blind dates.>"
