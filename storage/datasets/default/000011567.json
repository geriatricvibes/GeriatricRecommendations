Perhaps it was because of this that Jae-chan woke up again 6 years ago...\r\n\r\nThe person I wished to lean on and rely on was such a young person.\r\n\r\nWoo-jin was much younger and more beautiful than he remembered. Jae-chan made a new plan, this time to become someone who helps Woo-jin and other important people.\r\n\r\n[SUCCESS PROJECT]\r\n\r\nJae-chan has succeeded in all projects except for his love for Woojin.\r\n\r\nWill he be able to complete this project successfully as well?>"
