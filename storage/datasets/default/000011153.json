What they thought was a safe marriage, quickly turned into a problem.\r\n\r\n“...Am I the only one embarrassed in this situation?”\r\n\r\nWhat she sees in the morning is the beginning of a new world’s situation of a man and woman that returned to being grown ups.\r\n\r\nWeren't they supposed to not touch each other?\r\n\r\nWhat will be the end of this contract marriage?\r\n>"
