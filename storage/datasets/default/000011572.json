	"description": "Liesel Crow was executed by the Crown Prince, Ulysses, who was supposed to be her lover.\r\nThis was all because she was framed by the evil saint.\r\n\r\nWhere did I go wrong, and what did I do wrong?\r\nI never want to live like this again.\r\n\r\nLiesel thinks about this in her fading consciousness, but before she knows it, she's back to her six-year-old self!\r\n\r\nI'm not going to make a mistake this time. I'm going to live a peaceful life! Determined to do so, she continues to choose a different path from the last time, but...\r\nThe saint's childhood friend, Gideon, a duke, gets involved for some reason.\r\nI'm trying to keep my distance from you!\r\n\r\n“Liesel, help me quickly!”\r\n“Do I have to help you......?”\r\n“What are you talking about, ......? Of course you do! Come on!”\r\n\r\n　Also, is it only me who feels that the personality of the crown prince is strange this time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
