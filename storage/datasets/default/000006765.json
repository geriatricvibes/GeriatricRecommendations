Being made to reincarnate to a certain planet by a mysterious young man, this is a tale of how he conveniently uses his overflowing abilities to go on a simple journey. Although he is the strongest protagonist, he does not realize his strength.\r\n\r\nThis is not a story where a cute girl comes out. There is no harem. There is not a single element of romance.\r\n\r\nThis is the life in another world of a young man who, along with his unique comrade, continued on a journey while collecting raw materials. And so~ometimes fights.>"
