	"description": "They call this place Edgetown—a small mountain village overlooking a vast, blazing wasteland. They say that no one could survive beyond this point, but young Noi could see the faint outline of a mountain in the distance. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone really know what is on the other side, or is it just that no one has ever dared the perilous journey? \r\n\r\nNoi, refusing to accept baseless rumors, waits for nightfall to begin his journey…\r\n\r\n“Edgelands”, set in the same universe as “Rainlands”, is a testament to the yearning of a human soul.>"
