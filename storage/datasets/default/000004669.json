	"description": "Chu Ci couldn't help but smile: 'Han Yue, I'm about to die. You should be happy, why do you look like you're about to cry?'\r\n\r\nHan Yue paused, coldly replying with a question after a while: 'Your death should bring about much joy to many people, how would there be a person who would shed tears for you?'\r\n\r\n'...That's true.' Chu Ci sighed as he nodded, 'I don't wish for you to shed a single drop of tear for me, dirtying my road to reincarnation.'>"
