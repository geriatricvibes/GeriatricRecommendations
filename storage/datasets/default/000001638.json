	"description": "In the most popular 3D keyboard online game “Tomorrow”, an ordinary player, Zhang Zhiyin had a less common hobby–that is to visit Dr. Y, the ultimate boss – giving him gifts and hugs.\n\nAs a game-produced NPC, the other side had, naturally, no response, but Zhang Zhiyin still insisted on visiting him rain or shine for 363 days. Until, one day, he decided to give up the game as a result of being hit by a car.\n\nSince then, he had been dreaming every night in which he would cross into the realistic world of “Tomorrow” and return to the magical journey of normal life during the day.\n\n****\n\n“From the moment he had fallen in love with this person, he had chosen insanity.”>"
