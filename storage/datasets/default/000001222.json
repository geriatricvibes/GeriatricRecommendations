	"description": "There are some people you hate at first but end up liking more and more the more you interact with them.\nThere are some people you love at first, but the more you come to understand that person, the more helpless you feel.\n\nThe Great Film Emperor, Ji Mian thinks that Young Master Xiao Jiashu is an arrogant, poison-mouthed, spoilt, rich snob who exploits his strong background to ruin people’s lives on a whim. But when he somehow obtains the ability to read minds, Ji Mian comes to realise that Xiao Jiashu is probably the most adorable person in the world.\n\nThis is a story about the rise of the acting-fanatic, Xiao Jiashu, as he silences his haters and wows the world with his magnificence.>"
