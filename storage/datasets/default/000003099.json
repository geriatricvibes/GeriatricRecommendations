	"description": "The sequel to God’s Left hand.\n\nTheir average age is around 20, the oldest is only 30.  But they all have forever left their names at all the major international competitions and all the professional forums.  In Chinese, in English, in numbers, or just a nickname, they are all legends without any reservations.\n\nThey deserved to be legends because they have written the history of the whole esports era.\n\nAnd this era will never end:\n\n“Our dreams had died long ago, but all the experiences and glory will be renewed once again, from this moment onward.”>"
