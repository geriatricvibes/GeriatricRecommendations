	"description": "Sophie, a low-ranking spiritist, set up a drugstore using money she stole. While enjoying the tranquility and peace in her drugstore, she treats a patient severely bleeding in the middle of the night. He was the lieutenant of the Duke of Arthur, who was also suffering from insomnia. Sophie serves the Duke tea with medicinal herbs to her regret. A few days later, Arthur returns to the drugstore.\n\n“How on earth did you do it?”\n\nIt was insomnia that could not be cured with any medicine, and that day, he drank Sophie’s tea and slept in the carriage.\n\n“Did you put me to sleep with magic?”\n\n“… I just served you tea.”\n\nAfter that, Arthur accompanied the knights to visit the drugstore every day to bother Sophie, and to make matters worse, Prince Valentis, cursed by the dragon, also visited the drugstore.\n\n“Please go to the Imperial Palace with me!”\n\nWill Sophie be able to maintain a quiet drugstore life?>"
