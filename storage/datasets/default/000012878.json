	"description": "When hens were on the edge of extinction, roosters had a hard time finding a mate. Humans were on the verge of losing baby chicks…..and eggs to eat!\r\n\r\nBut luckily, ABO hormones appeared. The later generations of chickens were able to continue to multiply. Chickens laid eggs; eggs hatched into chickens.\r\n\r\nThe useless, skinny, little Omega chicken didn’t receive a warm welcome for the reason that it was hard for him to get pregnant. Until one day, when he met a fat and blind rooster.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, they became the world’s most handsome Alpha chicken and the world’s most fertile Omega chicken.>"
