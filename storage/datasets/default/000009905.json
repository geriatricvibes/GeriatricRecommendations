	"description": "Senior Brother said, “Immortal cultivation is a very long and painful process… Huh? How comes it only took you three months to form a golden core?!\r\n\r\nMy answer, “Because I have mastered all skills, I thought of trying some cultivation shortcuts and cheats.”\r\n\r\nThe Demon King said, “After consuming you, I will collect your yin to replenish my yang… Hey! What are you doing? What are you grabbing? How can you grab my thing like that?!\r\n\r\nMy answer, “Because my in-game character’s race was a demon. Your collecting yin techniques better make me come!”\r\n\r\nThe Devil King said, “If humanity was to possess paramount power, it’s bound to become ugly from greed… Hey! Did you hear what I say? To possess so many mystical beasts with no rim or rhymes, having the whole world inside your palm won’t be a problem. But how can you do nothing and just sleep all day?\r\n\r\nMy answer, “Because my dream is to attain the peak of the realm of full-time sponger.”>"
