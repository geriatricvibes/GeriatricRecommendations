	"description": "For others, apocalypse means running away, killing zombies and upgrading. \n\nFor Shi Lingxi, it means not only running away, fighting zombies, and upgrading but also public display of affection!!!\n\nIt’s not that he is weird, but that he has a weird system that requires him and his forcibly bound target to reach a certain love index of sprinkling dogfood. In order to survive in the apocalypse days, he can’t not do it. \n\nShi Lingxi: Dear Lou Yuan, come here, muah~~\n\nLou Yuan: Muah~~\n\n[[The SYSTEM A236 reminds the host that the daily task reward has been issued and the repeated completion of the same task is invalid. ]]\n\n\nShi Lingxi: What’s wrong with me showing my love for Lou Yuan? Hmph.>"
