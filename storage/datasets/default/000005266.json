	"description": "— “I like you. I’ve always liked you.”\n\nA sudden confession made at an idol handshake session. This was not an unusual scene. However, Yorito’s fate began to change drastically after this confession.\n\nThe next day, the girl sitting next to him, her eyes hidden by her bangs, changed her attitude completely. Up until now, they had only greeted each other lightly, but for some reason, the girl with hidden eyes was watching Yorito.\n\nWhen Yorito returns from lunch, he finds a cute envelope with a letter in it in his desk. The envelope and letter had no name written on it, just a request to come to the rooftop after school. Yorito went to the rooftop as stated in the letter.\n\nAnd what was waiting for him there was the girl sitting next to him.>"
