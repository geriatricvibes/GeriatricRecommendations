	"description": "Yo, Hi! I’m Frank, I made a deal with a demon to pay me some money for receiving a guest for a few days every week.\n\nI had no idea about what I have done.\n\nOn May 1st, Conan ‘the God of Death’ came to my house. I was forced to let him in and we get involved in a criminal case.\n\nOn May 8th, Bruce Wayne ‘Batman’ came to me. I was forced to follow him to fight crime.\n\nOn May 16th, Hannibal Lecter, The Silence of the Lambs, came to my home. I can only say that I really can’t stand my guests.>"
