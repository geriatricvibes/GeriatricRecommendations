	"description": "[As you probably already know, I'm leaving you this letter only to keep my promise.]\r\n\r\nElisha, the Archmage of the Cardion Empire, and the fiancee of Emperor Erich wrote.\r\n\r\n[The prince-no, Your Majesty, always said, 'I'd rather die than marry you!']\r\n\r\nOne day, she suddenly disappears, leaving only a letter to her fiance.\r\n\r\nBut contrary to what Elisha expected that he wouldn't try to find her,  Erich immediately starts looking for her.\r\n\r\n'Whether it's inside or outside of the Empire, find her.'\r\n\r\nWhen you find her and bring her back to me, then…\r\n\r\n'We'll make a new promise.'\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty.'\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, Elisha couldn't let Erich find her, but soon after, she found herself straining against the grip on her hand. \r\n\r\n'Please.'\r\n\r\nErich shook his head and opened his mouth again. The hand that was holding Elisha's wrist went down and took her hand.\r\n\r\n'Don't leave.'>"
