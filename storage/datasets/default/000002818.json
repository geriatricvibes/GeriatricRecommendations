	"description": "A seafood chef inexplicably transmigrated into ancient times. Even though he landed in a family with a noble rank, and theoretically was supposed to be rich, the most valuable thing in the house is a grey donkey…\n\nSu Yu stared at the sky helplessly; in order to support the family, he could only take up his old profession and go out to sell fish.\n\nUnfortunately, the royal family selected concubines from both genders. Even as a poor noble, he had no choice but to attend…\n\nDISCUSSION TOPIC: Will I be selected if I display my fish-slaughtering skills?\n\n“Meow!” His Imperial Majesty shook his tail.>"
