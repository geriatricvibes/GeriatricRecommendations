She held on to her handsome and rich husband, refusing to let go, devoting herself to protecting and pampering him. She worked hard to become stronger so that she could stand shoulder to shoulder with him. \r\n\r\nBefore her revival, Qin Shu believed the words of her younger sister. She hated him, blamed him, and devised a thousand ways to run away from him. \r\n\r\nYet, he loved her deeply, pampered her with all his heart, and allowed her to behave atrociously.>"
