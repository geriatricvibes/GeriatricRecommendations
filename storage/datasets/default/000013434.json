	"description": "Emi Nikokado, a very ordinary female office worker, received an e-mail from her father (60), who had gone missing without her knowledge.\r\n\r\nAccording to his message, he was currently living in another world with an elf.\r\n\r\n'No way!' She then double-checked everything, and it was confirmed to be true.\r\n\r\nWhile she did feel concerned at the idea of a beautiful elf and her father cohabitating, Emi worked tirelessly for the sake of her only living family in her present world.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, Emi then proceeded to read a lot of light novels and sent packages to the other world via Ama**n.\r\n\r\nAnd these are snippets of Emi's struggles and her father's second life in another world.\r\n>"
