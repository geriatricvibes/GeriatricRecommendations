	"description": "Sylvia Skyrose, daughter of the Duke of Skyrose, could not stand to let a commoner who can only use rare magic attend the Royal Magic Academy alongside her. “I, Sylvia Skyrose, will be honest with you: there is no place for you in this time-honored Royal Magic Academy! You should leave at once!” She had thought that the words of such a high-ranking noblewoman would convince the commoner to do just that but–\r\n\r\n“Lady Sylvia, please be my Mistress!”\r\n\r\n“Mi-Mistress?”\r\n\r\n“I will do anything for you if you become my mistress.”\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a Duke’s daughter who ends up swayed by a Heroine who wants to be oppressed by her noble and proud Mistress.>"
