	"description": "She conspires and provokes the most powerful young master in Beijing! They sign a contract and with his every call, she has to go anywhere and do anything his bidding. When their contract ends, she smirks and said, “I’ll take the money and you can leave. We don’t owe each other anything.” \r\n\r\nHe is Young Master Ya who rules Beijing. He controls the business empire during the day, and he is the strongest king at night. He is cold and women are merely playthings to him. With his power, the women he has eyes on have never been willing to leave him, yet she is an exception. She loves money, like all the previous women, but she is never shy of showing her greed. And he never realizes that he will ever grow a heart for such a promiscuous and cheap woman… \r\n\r\nHe points a gun straight at her heart. “Die with me, or accept my love—which one do you choose?” She pouts and turns around, before she pushes an adorable child into his arms. “Here, there’s your answer.”>"
