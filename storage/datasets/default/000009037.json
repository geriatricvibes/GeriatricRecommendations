Because of that, he was known as the eternal rank E, third-rate adventurer.\n\nOne day, Luke was hired for cheap by a hero’s party to do odd jobs, when he was forced to bear the consequences caused by the hero’s mistake, and was left behind in the labyrinth of a difficult-to-clear dungeon.\n\nLuke was prepared for death, but his [Repair] skill evolved during his survival from the brink of death, and Luke managed to escape.\n\nNow that Luke had returned alive, he decided to stop doing dangerous jobs and turned over a new leaf.\n\nUsing his evolved [Repair] skill, Luke opened up a weapon shop for adventurers in a village with a small dungeon.\n\nHe aimed for a slow life with his second life. His second life, where he lived quietly and comfortably!\n\n……at least, that’s what he thought, when a major incident shaking the entire country appeared before Luke’s eyes…..?>"
