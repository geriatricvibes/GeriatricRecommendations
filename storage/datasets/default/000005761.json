	"description": "“Please let my husband love me, even in his death.”\r\n\r\nUpon the statue that grants wishes, Renier wished for the love of her cheating husband but then died at his hands.\r\nWhen she opened her eyes again, Renier had returned to the moment she made a wish.\r\nOf all moments, it just had to be the exact moment she spoke the word ‘husband’.\r\n\r\nWishes could not be changed, lost, or stopped in the middle. In the end, Renier made a wish as soon as it came out of her mouth…\r\n\r\n“Please let my husband… Please be my husband!”\r\n\r\nShe was wondering if this wish would come true since she asked the statue to be her husband.\r\n\r\n“I, Veldemer, am your husband from this moment on.”\r\n\r\nThe statue shattered and an incredibly handsome man came out.\r\nNaked too.\r\nRenier’s gaze follows his dangerous and overbearing face, and the well-defined abs under the wide shoulder, with firm thighs and his manly…!\r\n\r\n“Your wish has come true, so why are you not happy?”\r\n\r\n“I, It’s because you’re not wearing clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Why do I have to? You are now my wife…”\r\n\r\nHe whispered as he drew closer to Renier, not wearing a single thread.\r\n\r\n“You are free to watch as much as you want.”\r\n\r\n‘If he asks me to see it, then I’ll see it… \r\nbut Sir Veldemer doesn’t seem to know that I have another husband, so he is my second husband.\r\nOn the day this is revealed, guess I will have to go to prison and rot for 10 years.’\r\n\r\nBefore that happens, one of the two houses must be dealt with.\r\nThere are two ways.\r\nDivorce with her cheating husband, or seal Veldemer back into the statue.>"
