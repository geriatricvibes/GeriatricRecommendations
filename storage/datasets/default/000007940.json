	"description": "When she reborn, she finally understood; men can never be relied on.\n\nThat being the case, she can only rely on herself to win, that splendid brilliance she yearned for, in this lifetime.\n\nTo my scheming stepmother and ruthless sister, I will destroy all your backings, pull off your wings, and step on your arrogance! As for grandmother whom speaks kindly but has a snake-like heart, and a father who is hypocritical and exploits advantages; I will tear off your pretense and cut off your hope! Let’s see how you can still scheme against me!\n\nWitness her splendid fight against her stepmother, punish scum men, and create havoc in the imperial court, as she soars with the wind and rises above the water!\n\nBut as for that man who still stands! How dare he play with my heart?>"
