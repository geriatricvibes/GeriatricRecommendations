	"description": "One day, I picked up a person who lost his memory. He is very big and he has a devilishly beautiful face, but he behaved like a seven-year-old child. I thought he was abandoned because of his condition. I brought him home and took care of him sincerely. At first, he caused many accidents like a troublemaker, but he became more precious to me day by day.\r\n\r\nAs their bond grew stronger, a man chasing after the whereabouts of the child appeared in a small county estate. In a desperate attempt to escape and in order to save the child, he pays the witch a price to save the child…\r\nAnd so, the child’s identity was exposed as the ‘cursed prince’.\r\n>"
