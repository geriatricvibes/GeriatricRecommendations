	"description": "《I’m sorry, I only thought of you as a cat》\n\nOn the third day after the death of his beloved cat, Guaji, the heartbroken He Yunzhou picked up a man on his doorstep.\n\nYes, he knew that the other party was just a neighbor who lives upstairs.\n\nBut before this day, he couldn’t have imagined that there really was such a person so similar to his Guaji……\n\nIt was probably because of this that he couldn’t help but raise this awkward, wayward, and troublesome man.\n\nAs for the industry elite; the dashing, rich, outstanding, wanderer, Huo Zheng,\n\nHe wouldn’t realize until much later,\n\nThat as it turns out, the man treated him so well wasn’t because he wanted to have a partner,\n\nBut because he……is just a substitute for a dead cat.\n\n……\n\nHuo Zheng: Every day I fall in love alone and rely on my own imagination to the ups and downs of love, sadness, joy, and parting……(he’s really a gong that thinks a lot)\n\nMeanwhile, He Yunzhou: Cook with your heart and feed the one that looks like his cat on his dining table. Love? What is love? (bewildered)>"
