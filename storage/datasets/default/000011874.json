	"description": "As a human and devil hybrid as well as the House of Phenex’s fourth son, Tenraku faced pressure as great as a mountain.\n\nHe couldn’t study magic, nor awaken the bloodline of the phoenix. As such he became the Underworld’s famous waste.\n\nBut none of this mattered. He had his 【Sacred Gear Plunder】!\n\n【Gauntlet of the Red Dragon Emperor – Boosted Gear】, 【Light Wings of the White Dragon Sovereign – Divine Dividing】, 【Holy Grail of the Secluded World – Sephiroth Graal】\n\nSo what if you’re an angel? So what if you’re a devil! Even if you’re a dragon god, so what!? Anything I want, I plunder! Plunder! Plunder!\nEven plundering the Heavens!>"
