	"description": "In the eastern frontier of the continent there was a house Telsia and a knight who served them for many years. Age had taken its toll on his body, and knowing that the last of his days grew ever nearer, he retired from his service to his lords, surrendered nearly all he owned, and set off on a journey–a solitary journey that he might taste all the curious foods and see all of the interesting sights that this world had to offer. What he did not realize, however, was that this journey was but the beginning of a tale that would be told in the continent for many years to come.>"
