	"description": "I am Lilianne Abenstar, and I have been reincarnated into an otome game.  The elder sister of the beauty of a man, knight-type capture target, and fiancee to the cool-type Duke's heir capture target, I'm extremely busy doing bad things... though that's a lie.  I actually haven't done anything at all.  After the conviction of the felonious aristocratic ladies, I'll properly pay for my sins, so please allow me to pass my time peacefully until then.>"
