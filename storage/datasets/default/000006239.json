	"description": "I, Kaya Minafuchi, a Japanese high school girl, was summoned to another world by its god, in order to protect it. Their god had summoned me to defend this world, and to the people that summoned me, my reply was of course:\r\n\r\n“I don’t care about that. It’s your world, so do something about it yourselves.”>"
