	"description": "<i>This city has its secrets.</i>\r\n\r\nWhether it's comfort or chaos, rain or shine, everything is dependent on a single person. People who live here don't get sick, nor do they get hurt. Once they enter, however, they can never leave. Unless they pay with their life…\r\n\r\nTang Shan wakes up, only to find himself in an unfamiliar house.\r\nA stranger tells him that he is his lover— Li Yuanyu. He says that Tang Shan has been in this city for quite some time. Tang Shan doesn't believe it, because he's obviously not gay, so how could he fall in love with a man? But there's Li Yuanyu's affectionate and attentive care, the artwork in the attic, the nostalgic warm smell of Borscht...\r\n\r\nMemories of the past begin to resurface, proving that both of them were in love.\r\nThat is, until he discovers the message he left for himself before he lost his memories, telling him he has to escape, no matter what it takes...>"
