	"description": "When a living person takes up a position in the nether world, they’re known as “Impermanent”. \n\nLan He managed to squeeze into the entertainment circle, but wavered constantly around the 38th tier because of his lack of background.\n\n At first, knowing that he has to work part-time as an Impermanent and live off of the Nether World, he rejected it, until he realised... Why did working part time in the Nether World help him become famous in the Over World? \n\nLan He: “It’s me, the darkest rogue in the Nether World, the hottest star in the Over World.”>"
