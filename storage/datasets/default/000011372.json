	"description": "It was the Great Age of Pirates, surging forward with their thousand sails unfurled.\n\nOne young man from earth ate the Goro Goro no Mi (Rumble-Rumble Fruit) and joined the Marine.\n\nJustice vs Evil, Freedom vs Tyranny, the colliding waves between them would never cease.\n\nBut all of this…..”I couldn’t care less about!!”\n\nAt the summit of the war, surrounded by ten thousand people, Rowen held a thunder halberd in hand and walked forward with strong steps.\n\nRivals meet face to face, but only one could become the King.>"
