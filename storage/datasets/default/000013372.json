	"description": "Bianca de Blanchefort. \r\n\r\nThe wife of Zachary de Arno, thrown out of Arno family after his death due to her self-indulgent, frivolous, and immoral behavior. She had nowhere to go, the Blanchefort family having already fallen to ruin, and was more or less kicked to a convent out in the border. A woman who ultimately met her end on a cold stone floor. \r\n\r\nA villainess with no honor.\r\n\r\nThat was Bianca’s life before she went back in time. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“Is this truly reality? Did I really travel back to the past?”\r\n\r\nThis was neither a dream nor a hallucination. This feeling of hunger, fatigue, the vivid sense of everything around her…\r\n\r\nThis was all real. \r\n\r\nIf this was indeed reality… If God truly gave her one more precious chance…!  \r\n\r\n‘I’m going to carry out a business. A marriage is a business in the end. Zachary’s child will be the perfect source of financial support. I’m sure my dowry will remain safe too. I won’t have to lose the Blanchefort or Arno territories to that damned viscount either.’\r\n\r\nThen whether it be through seduction or persuasion, she needed to give birth to her husband, Zachary’s child. \r\n\r\n“How much was my dowry exactly?”\r\n\r\n“400 calves, 900 pigs, 100 units of silverware, 300 rolls of silk, 2 crates of jewels, and a portion of a territory… Equivalent to a two-year budget for the Arno county.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think you should compensate for that?”>"
