	"description": "Su Ming entered the VRMMO game  and received a strong talent at the very start.\n\n[Grace of Life]: Eternal Tier Talent. When healed by its healing skills, you will randomly receive a layer of permanent buffs that cannot be removed….\n\n“Frost Breaker” “Dragon’s Blessing” “Infernal Dark Flames”\n\nEventually,  Su Ming had stacked up thousands of layers of buffs that, when added, amounted to hundreds of thousands of buffs.\n\nWhen the Mythical Boss had spawned, Su Ming effortlessly tanked all of the Boss’s earth-shattering skills. With just a spell, he landed tens of billions of damage on the Mythical Boss in a matter of seconds.\n\n“WTF is this?! T-this is a Priest?!” \n\nAll players stared at the scene blankly.\n\nAll priest players cried envious tears after witnessing his feat. They were Priests too but why was there such a huge gap between them?>"
