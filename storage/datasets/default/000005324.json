	"description": "Super troublesome!\n\nSince when was being pregnant easier than buying fresh vegetables? Alright, alright, she did admit herself that she had been muddleheaded, but this man really does not have any sense of commitment.\n\nAs the host of the night club, not only is he bad at servicing others, his ‘skill’ turned out to be deadly worse.\n\nIt pained her to death, and by that time her mood had already turned sour.\n\nShe will absolutely report this to Customer Association.\n\nBut… but… he wasn’t a host after all!\n\nFurthermore, to her surprise, the worse thing that was to transpire was that she had become pregnant with his child!\n\nThe next chronology is big. The most misfortune thing was that she was his only antidote.\n\nHu hu hu, someone tell her, what should she do in order to free herself from this big dilemma?>"
