	"description": "I, Ulysses Addinson, suddenly remember my previous life, and realize I'm the villain in the smartphone game 'Flowers of the Royal Palace ~A Shrine Maiden Held by Roses of Seven Colors~'. But I remember far too late, and there are only seven days remaining until the in-game event where I'm to be convicted.\r\n\r\nIt's much too late by the time I figure it out, but this is the story of a struggling young villain.>"
