	"description": "There was once a hero.\n\nUnique black hair. Excellent eyes. Contrary to his delicate features, he who had abnormal strength was called the Otherworldy Hero.\n\nAt the hero’s long adventure (up to the point where his wooden sword that had been kindly granted to him by the king was replaced by the holy sword blessed by the holy maiden) he saved the prince that had been kidnapped by the demon king, and so the kingdom was swept by worry.\n\nThe hero’s strength that could fell the demon king was deemed too dangerous to leave unrestrained.\n\nOne advisor spoke up. Why not marry him to royalty?\n\nThe king thought that was a viable option. Family, to an alien from another world would be the best of chains. There was one problem. The king was abundantly blessed with sons and had princes galore, but not a single daughter.\n\nHo, and it wasn’t like I could marry off two boys.\n\nAt a burst of inspiration the king slapped his knee.\n\nThat was it!\n\nYou just had to turn a prince into a princess!\n\nAnd so the hero ended up in a position to be marrying a man.\n\nThis story, is a tale of the aforementioned otherworldly hero, and his bride, the former-prince-now-princess and their ridiculously hilarious marriage.>"
