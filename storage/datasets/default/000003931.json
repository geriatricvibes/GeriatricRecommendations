	"description": "I met the male lead in prison.\n\nOkay. I get that I transmigrated into an R-19 tragic romantic novel, but why is he like this?\n\n“Bark! Bark! Bark! Grrrrrr…”\n\nI can’t believe this guy is held by a curse that makes him act like a beast…And that’s not the end of it, because when he returns to normal for a moment.\n\n“I-i-if you aren’t g-going to take responsibility for what you did to me, th-th-then don’t t-touch me!”\n\nAt any rate, I felt relieved that I probably wouldn’t have any sort of romantic interactions with this guy.\n\nA year later...\n\n “Th-th-the day I leave this place, please…m-meet up with me!”\n\nWell it wouldn’t be a big deal to meet him once. But, then, when I was released from prison…\n\n***\n\n“Welcome back. My lovely younger sister.”\n\nThe day of my release, a man approached me. Turns out, I’m the villain’s sister.\n\n“You must have suffered going to prison in my stead. I waited only for you.”\n\n…F*ck. My brother’s the male lead’s sworn enemy?\n\n***\n\n3 years later, I met the male lead. He looked totally different than when I last saw him.\n\n“It’s been a while, Iana. I’m going to kidnap you now.”>"
