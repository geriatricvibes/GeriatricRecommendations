	"description": "The two opposing families, with generations of feud, received an order from the king:\n\n“The two families must become in-laws to bury the hatchet and start anew.”\n\nJu family’s youngest daughter, Ju Ha-young:\n\n“Do you think I want to get married to you? I don’t like you either.”\n\nYeon family’s second son, Yeon Mu-eun:\n\n“Would you prefer to die rather than be the daughter-in-law of the Yeon family?”\n\nThey held presumptions about each other based on the rumours they heard, giving rise to misunderstandings between them. In time, their feelings slowly changed for each other.\n\n‘It’s strange.’\n\nCan there be no smoke without fire? Ha-young could not understand the bad rumors surrounding her good-natured husband.\n\n‘You’re mine.’\n\nMu-eun felt an overwhelming joy as he looked at his wife’s dear smile. He desired that smile.>"
