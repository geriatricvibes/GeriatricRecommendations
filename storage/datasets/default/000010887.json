	"description": "'I like you.' The man suddenly looked up and said to the opposite man, very very sincere.\r\n\r\n'……I do not accept.'\r\n\r\n'I really like you, Xiǎoxīn. I have liked you since I was a student. I like you is not the kind of impulsive like, but really treat you as a lifelong lover.\r\n\r\n'I said ah, Xué dì, can you...'\r\n\r\n'I like you! I like you very much! I can't live without you in my life. I can't live without you, just like a fish can't leave water, a bird can't live without the sky, and a zhái nán can't leave a computer. Xiaoxin, I really like……' (Otaku)\r\n\r\n'So I said, Xue di...' the man opposite sighed.\r\n\r\n'Don't you accept it, Xiaoxin? Is it because I am not good enough? If this is the case, I can change it... I can...'\r\nThe opposite man finally couldn’t help it.\r\n\r\n'I said, Xue di, the question is not whether I accept it or not ... but do you think this situation is suitable for thinking about such things?'>"
