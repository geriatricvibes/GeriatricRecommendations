	"description": "‘I’m sure I was……dead.’\n\nAnnette Bavaria, a woman from the most prestigious noble family in the Deltium Kingdom, returned back to the day of her wedding.\n\nThe groom’s face was fierce as they entered the hall for the ceremony. He clutched her arm tightly because he hated Annette terribly.\n\nNow they were going to have a hellish marriage again, hurting each other.\n\n                                       ***\n\n“Don’t do this, Rafael.”\n\n“Shh, Annette. If you really want me to stop, please don’t open your dirty mouth. I’m going crazy right now because I want to squeeze it right in.”\n\nShe looked at her husband tearing her clothes with tearful eyes.\n\nHe was still horribly mean, arrogant, and a beast who only coveted her body.\n\nIf she didn’t want to die again, she had to tame this wicked beast somehow.\n\nThere was no other option.>"
