	"description": "The Gong is called Qiong Dafang. The Shou is called Zhen Xiaoqi.\r\n\r\nHahaha, from their names you can already tell their personalities.\r\n\r\nGong is poor but generous. The moment he gets his salary, he will treat others or loan money out and finish his salary in half a month.\r\n\r\nShou was really stingy. He would calculate even up to one cent. His hobby was to go to the supermarket to snatch discounted eggs and vegetables with old aunties. Even if the Gong wanted to eat duck, Shou would not bear to buy duck meat. Instead, he bought cheap duck bones to boil soup.\r\n\r\nIt can be said that the two secretly had a crush on each other but they did not know about each other’s feelings. After being together as friends for many years, because of an opportunity they finally realized.\r\n\r\nQiong Dafang and Zhen Xiaoqi are really a pair made in heaven.>"
