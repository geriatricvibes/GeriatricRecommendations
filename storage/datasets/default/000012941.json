	"description": "Edel possesses her favorite novel and marries Liena's older brother.\r\n\r\nI thought we would naturally become a family, but that's just my imagination.\r\n\r\nI asked for a divorce because I was tired of my cold husband, who only cared about his younger sister, and couldn't be separated from her.\r\n\r\n'Divorce? Absolutely not. Wasn't it good when we were in a relationship?'\r\n\r\n'Sister-in-law, think about it again!'\r\n\r\nUnlike in the past, I am determined now.\r\n\r\n'Then, can I get the mine back, which is my dowry?'\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, sister-in-law.”\r\n\r\nThere's no need to think about it again.\r\n\r\nBut my husband comes from a powerful duke family.\r\n\r\nI need the help of the villain from the original story.\r\n\r\n'Who on earth gave you a hard time?'\r\n\r\nIsn't this man too precious to be hurt by Liena......?\r\n\r\n“The only person I want to have by my side is you, Edel.”\r\n\r\n......by your side?>"
