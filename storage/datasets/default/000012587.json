On the brink of committing suicide, she was stopped by a mysterious old man who nagged her about youth and life and then later on gave her a suspicious address claiming it is where she can find job. Eventually, it led her to the residence of a wizard. Then she just found herself under a life contract sealed when the wizard named Brylle Zaffiro kissed her. And the job is for her to be a housekeeper, cook, errand girl, research girl, and maid!>"
