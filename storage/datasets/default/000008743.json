	"description": "An Junyue, a modern-day cultivator who got thrust into another world when the time-space fabric ripped during a duel between his Shifu (master) and Shibo (master-elder uncle).\r\n\r\nLiu Li, a thousand year old fox who wanders the world searching for his lost sister.\r\n\r\nOne is a handsome and elegant youth with a gentle appearance like that of jade, but whose personality is actually reserved and composed.\r\n\r\nThe other is a beautiful and seductive fox demon with a fiery temper that can bring down cities.\r\n\r\nWith no previous connection between them, their fates intertwine when they decide to raise a toddler together.\r\n\r\nA corrupt monk, a fake Taoist, a carefree prince, a warm-hearted rabbit demon…. Every incident binds the two of them together, unable to unravel the thread.\r\n\r\nHow does the love-struck Liu Li ensnare the slow and unwary An Junyue?>"
