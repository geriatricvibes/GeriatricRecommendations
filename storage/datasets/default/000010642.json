	"description": "The exchange condition was to become god’s toy.\r\n\r\nIn return for helping her younger sister, Kusunoki Hinami was sent to this world. In this world, gathering ‘points’ and helping god was her role as a toy.\r\nBeing weak in combat, Hinami receives god’s blessing and lives on this world.\r\nFortunately, she had the rare talent of a ‘chemister’. With that skill and god’s blessing, she creates top-quality potions and succeeds in growing herbs that no one has managed to raise before.\r\n\r\nThat Hinami also goes on adventures with her friends…… this is a heartwarming manufacturing type fantasy.>"
