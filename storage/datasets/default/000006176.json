She returns four years later, only to be caught in a job with Li Shaoling, her stepsister’s fiancé-to-be as her boss.\n\n\n***\n\n\nJi Weixi was holding up a certain body part of the child and aiming it at the toilet.\n\n\nThe tot’s brow eased amidst the gushing. “”Comfy…””\n\n\nLi Shaoling’s gaze was overwhelmingly icy. “”You are not allowed to touch him there!””\n\n\nJi Weixi stared at him as if she was staring at an idiot. “”By what right?””\n\n\nLi Shaoling glared at her. “”You are only allowed to look at mine.””\n\n\nNever!!!”>"
