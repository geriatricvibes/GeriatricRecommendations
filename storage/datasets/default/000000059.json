She gets the house and the savings, but not the car.\n\nOh! And her son and daughter.\n\nShe had been a single woman in her 30’s in her previous life, and now she’s a mother?\n\nHow exciting is that?\n\nShe searched her memories. Two million dollars in savings. How much is two million dollars in the 90s?\n\nWhat’s a husband? The other woman can have him. I’m taking the money and my instant son and daughter to go and enjoy ourselves!>"
