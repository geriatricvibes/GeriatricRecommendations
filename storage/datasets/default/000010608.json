	"description": "He is someone who would reply to every one of Qing Kong’s Weibo status updates, as well as sit in front of his laptop waiting in the Qing Kong channel with other people to listen to every one of Qing Kong’s songs at the fan gathering time, he would listen to every audio drama that Qing Kong participated in and then he would write a very long review under the audio drama post.\r\n\r\nHe may do all of that but he would never knock on the other man’s door to say: “Hi, Qing Kong-sama, I’m your number one die-hard fan!”>"
