	"description": "One day, Julianne, the daughter of a marquis, suddenly regained the memory of her previous life. It caused her to reflect on her behavior in that world.\r\n\r\nWhile living lavishly, she would often bully her siblings and stalk her fiancé. So far, all her effort had been dedicated to wrongdoings. Both her horrid personality and her overweight appearance were like those of the villainous noble ladies she had read about in her previous life.\r\n\r\nA bleak future was the only thing waiting for her. If she wanted to avoid her demise, she needed to cleanse both her body and soul. With that in mind, she started doing her best to rekindle her relationship with her family and to go on a diet—\r\n\r\n“—For the sake of my family, I’m going to make it big, ohohoho!”>"
