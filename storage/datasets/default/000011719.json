	"description": "After going to the great beyond, Hirano Bonta was reincarnated as an Evil God. Descending upon the Demon Lands, he came across his follower, the 108th Demon Lord, the  Drake.\r\n\r\nA fortuitous omen…thought Drake, who had suffered a great defeat in battle, leaving him with only 200 underlings. On top of that, pursuers were hot on his tail; he was between a rock and a hard place. But the genius strategist Drake was not ready to give up just yet. Despite the crisis, he still held the ambition of unifying his nation once again.\r\n\r\nThe history-geek Hirano was super excited and was determined to support Drake as an Evil God, but as a newbie Evil God there was little he could do…just how will they get through this together?!>"
