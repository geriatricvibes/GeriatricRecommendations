	"description": "When the apocalypse came, everyone struggled to survive. Yang Hao, a dorm caretaker, was forced out to find food. During the crisis, he found out that he could pick up attributes dropped by zombies to strengthen himself.\n\n'You picked up the strength attribute, strength +1.'\n\n'You picked up the agility attribute, agility +1.'\n\n'You picked up the mutation attribute, blood awakening.'\n\n'You picked up a red envelope, obtained three bottles of mineral water!'\n\n'You picked up the silver treasure chest, obtained titanium pike!'\n\n'Beauties, food, and the vast lands, they are all mine!' Yang Hao loudly shouted as he looked at the densely packed zombies.\n\nFrom then on, corpses of mutants, evolved beasts, and ancient warriors piled up under his feet.>"
