	"description": "A good-for-nothing, blockheaded rich young master was thrown into the military by his family to teach him a lesson. In this rural, lousy place where nothing was accessible, Young Master Bai called for help in vain, and was forced to accept his fate tearfully. Enduring tough training as well as the daily bruising of his pride was already torturous enough for him, so why did he have to meet a jinx that was always giving him trouble and always coveted his butt? This jinx looked decent and proper on the outside, but was filled with wickedness. Young Master Bai would never surrender to him!\n\nThe novel is a story about a weakling of a little willow who, through the military, was guided into becoming a valiant and heroic little poplar. Watch how Young Master Bai takes one step after another to grow into an acceptable soldier of the republic!!>"
