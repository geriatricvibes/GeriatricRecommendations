(b ᵔ▽ᵔ)b]\n\nSayun, going crazy after being forced to play the villain, kidnaps Han Geonjoo, the key to escape the system.\n\n“What’s your motive?”\n\n“Recruiting talented people?”\n\n“By kidnapping them? I guess you’re from a gangster guild.”\n\nIt’s the key to escape the system, “The Resistance” and Sayun is trying to activate it by maintaining a close relationship with Han Geonjoo by raising him to an S-Class.\n\nSayun complimented Geonjoo and raised his stats to the fullest.
