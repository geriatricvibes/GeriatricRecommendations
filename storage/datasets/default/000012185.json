	"description": "Yan Leyang was an ordinary beastman—a typical corporate s*ave.\n\nOne day, he transmigrated and became a coquettish and b*tchy cannon fodder in a sci-fi novel.\n\nThe type that dies a tragic death and gets eaten alive.\n\nYan Leyang looked at the ‘race’ section on his ID card. His original/beast form was a ginger cat?\n\nYan Leyang who transmigrated: ······\n\nAlthough he looked tremendously weak.. Although he was also a small kitty…\n\nBut he was a big Siberian big ginger cat.\n\nAKA; an Amur (Siberian) tiger. \n\nThe little kitty that has ‘王’ [King] stripes on its forehead and has the ability to demolish a head with one bite…\n\nTransmigrated to the character’s closing story but didn’t die. Asking online for help, what to do next?>"
