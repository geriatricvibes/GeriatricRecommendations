	"description": "In the Ming Dynasty, the distinguished Luo family suffers a downfall and wanted to solve the crisis through a marriage arrangement. \n\nThe intelligent and introverted the 11th Lady was chosen, and she rose from a lowly concubine’s child to become the much-coveted madame of the Yong Ping Duke Manor.\n\nFacing the complicated web of the relationship as well as the distrust of her own family, the 11th Lady uses her kindness and purity to win the Xu family’s trust and respect; while her love and tolerance eventually won the respect of the people who used to look down on her. \n\nThe 11th Lady also uses her intelligence and wits to help her husband Xu Ling Yi to put forward plans and ideas, saving the Yong Ping Duke Manor from peril situations; and also improving the lives of the people.\n\n When the country faced invasion from external forces, the 11th Lady and Xu Ling Yi work together to lead the army, emerging victorious in their battles. Their relationship also deepens in the process.>"
