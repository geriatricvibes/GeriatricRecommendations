	"description": "Lin Xiao was addicted to reading Qidian novels. He always fantasized that he would have a day when he could transmigrate and then embrace beautiful women all over the whole world, becoming the strongest person in the mainland.\n\nAfter he really transmigrated, Lin Xiao stubbornly always believed that he was a protagonist until he met Ling Luo.\n\nOnly after being killed by Ling Luo did he know that he was only a cannon fodder villain in a novel.\n\nWhen he restarted his life and hatefully wanted to oppose his fate at least once, he was ruthlessly crushed again.\n\nOkay then… since a protagonist was determined to be like this, he wouldn’t oppose a protagonist anymore…\n\nThe two of them were similarly straight guys…\n\nWhen he restarted his life again, Ling Luo unexpectedly suffered a Love Herb’s poison…\n\nLin Xiao internally cried as he looked at a certain person who tied him onto an obelisk in the back and thought, who could tell him what this was all about?>"
