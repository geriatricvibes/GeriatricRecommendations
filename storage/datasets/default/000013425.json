	"description": "“I think my mom became a monster”\n\nIn the crowded and unpleasant morning rush subway, this sentence suddenly popped in to Xiao Jinyu’s mind.\n\nThe early office workers dozed off, the people in the crowded train swayed with the bumps of the subway.\n\nThe train continued to run, and without anyone’s notice, in the inescapable train, there was only two people left.\n\n“Ding Dong! Arrived at White Garden station.”\n\nThe world suddenly became quiet-\n\n“Does the Zhongdu metro have a stop called White Garden station?”\n\nFrom this moment on, Xiao Jinyu’s world became bright and colorful.\n\n“I hope with this world, it will rise from a huge and absurd logical fallacy”\n\n“In the meantime, I will give you the name-”\n\n“Fourth Perspective”>"
