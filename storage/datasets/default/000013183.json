	"description": "Morishita Yuu is a senior high school student who was placed in Class X due to a drastic drop in his scores, failing terribly in his junior high school results. Class X is one of the last in the grade. \n\nAlthough it might seem like a normal class, from what the others students have said, all the students from there are unapproachable, and the class itself has been nicknamed the “Isolated Classroom”. \n\nThere, Yuu meets the class monitor, Takamaru, along with many others. Only, as he discovers their individual personalities, he realizes that they are all absolute freaks! From this day on, Yuu begins his everyday life with a bunch of freaks.>"
