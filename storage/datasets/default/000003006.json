	"description": "“I don’t sleep with men. And don’t bring Yeonwoo into this.”\r\n\r\nKeith Night Pickman. The person who affected my life the most, but doesn’t care about me at all. Or he likes me a little, just that I have no place in his heart.\r\n\r\nI worked as a secretary for such a person. But one day, at an orgy party he hosted. Surrounded by alphas, I was traumatized. Rather than listen to the man’s abuses and faulting me, I resigned from his company.\r\n\r\nAfter one week, for some reason, Keith came to me on his own accord and asked me to return to the office...\r\n\r\n“Are you asking me to come back?”\r\n\r\n“Well, isn’t that what it looks like? ...Tell me, anything you want.”\r\n\r\nYou. I bit my lips, barely managing to suppress that word. There are many other ways to die.>"
