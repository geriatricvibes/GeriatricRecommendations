	"description": "Hello there dear customer, here is Juliana’s workshop, may I ask what do you need? The choice of goods here is for you gentlemen to pick, they have reasonable prices and I won’t deceive either youngsters or old folks. If you need a customized product and have the patience, I will also offer it to you with both hands as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOh? Do you want something a bit more special?\r\n\r\nThat would be even better.\r\n\r\nThe humble me, Juliana, is an alchemist who can make everything you can and can’t imagine…\r\n\r\nAnd I also love a career that is refining heroes, overlords, queens, saints, devils…\r\n\r\nWhat kind of person do you want to be then, dear customer?\r\n\r\nThis’s the story of a perverted old woman who has no love.>"
