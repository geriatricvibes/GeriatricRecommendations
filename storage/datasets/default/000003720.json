	"description": "My childhood friend Gio, who grew up with me in an orphanage, became a hero. \r\n\r\nIt was said that Gio, who successfully defeated the demon king and returned, will become a member of the noble class and marry the princess! \r\n\r\nIt seemed that I, who had been running the orphanage since the death of the old director, had been judged to be an unsuitable friend for Gio in the future. \r\n\r\nThe princess offered me gold coins and said, \r\n\r\n”You promise you’ll never see Gio again, right?”\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
