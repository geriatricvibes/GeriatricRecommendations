	"description": "'Can you be useful to me?'\n\n'I... I can be...'\n\nThe first time they met, she knelt trembling before him, begging for shelter. The slave caught his interest, and he brought her back to his palace.\n\nShe could've never imagined that in one night she'd go from a spoiled little slave princess of a defeated kingdom, to becoming a powerful prince's pet.\n\nHe kept her by his side... spoiled her, cared for her, loved her, and gave her meticulous care and high status. Whatever she wished... she could do so under his name.\n\nBut, she angered him and chose to run away. He captured her within a day.\n\n'Don't forget, my little dearest, everything I have given you can be taken back...'\n\nIn a spur of anger, she hit him, her feeble hands striking against the flesh of his cheek. Gnashing her teeth in anger, she said, 'Do you have the ability to take my child back?!'>"
