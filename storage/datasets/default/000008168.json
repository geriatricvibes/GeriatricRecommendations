	"description": "Hasami Tatsuro and Yashiki Ai, two ordinary teenagers, experienced an earthquake while on the way home from school.\n\nThe earthquake cracked space and transported the two to another world.\n\nLanding in an unknown forest, the two initially began to grieve. However, unbeknownst to them, a system had installed itself into their bodies, granting them the ability to gain skills and statuses.\n\nHasami Tatsuro obtained the “Level Eater” skill. “Level Eater” allowed the host to devour others’ levels/skills and make it his own.\n\nYashiki Ai obtained the “Valkyrie” skill. “Valkyrie” allowed the host to obtain and use any offensive skills from different classes, without the need to specialize.\n\nWith their cheat skills and teamwork, they managed to venture out of the forest and explore the new world.\n\nThis is a story of two ordinary kids.\n>"
