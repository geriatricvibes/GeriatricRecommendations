	"description": "Before being sold as the Crown Prince’s concubine, I proposed a contract marriage to the Duke.\r\n \r\n“Will your father allow you to marry me?”\r\n“Of course not. So there is only one way.”\r\n \r\n“We have to make an accident.”\r\n \r\nIt will taste better when I break that molester’s head.\r\nI could shoot a gun at the alley gangster. Even the prince of the neighboring empire was also knocked out by me.\r\n \r\nThe man snorted.\r\n \r\n“You’re so arrogant as the captive subject. I never knew that Count Bornes would be a jerk to his dog.”\r\n \r\nI said with a smile, “Our mansion didn’t have a dog. Because the owner of the mansion is already a dog.”\r\n \r\nThis is the story of Arianne Bornes, who seemed to be a villainess but not a villainess. \r\n>"
