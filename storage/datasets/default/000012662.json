	"description": "ーーーIs there any blunt weapon shining in your heart?\n\nI’m Hanna Falsett, an ordinary girl who dreams of becoming an adventurer.\n\nBut, because I’m so slow and clumsy, my classmates and even the chairman made fun of me. I was even kicked out of the school.\n\nI found a construction site when I was driven to the point of starvation. I picked up a hammer I found there, and suddenly, my talent bloomed!\n\nNot only useful for blacksmithing and building constructions, but my【Blunt Weapon】skill I got was also useful for fighting. With this skill, I’ll show you that I’m also able to grow splendidly!\n\nDefeating dragons, building shops, saving the countryー\n\nThe adventure of me with blunt weapons, using blunt weapons, for blunt weapons, begins!\n\nActually, I want a sword though…….. but I promise, I won’t say it again!>"
