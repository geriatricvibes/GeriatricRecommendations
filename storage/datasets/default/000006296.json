	"description": "The aristocratic juvenile claimed to be less evil, and the people met and fled. A momentary accidental contact with the FireWire caused the destruction of the family to death. If there is no teacher to send a guardian, life is not saved. Five years after the injury was frozen, the memory was lost and lost. For the confidant, he went to his hometown in thousands of miles. When the Nengnai boy found his memory, he knew he had betrayed his own family and his family had been destroyed. His parents were still dead, and he was already a treachery. What is wrong with the pro? Innocence! Just because of lack of strength, hands without power, inability to protect their homes, they are bullied so far, and they can't speak out! For the newspaper's ruined family and dead hatred, the oath of death and revenge! But for all my enemies, he must be killed in the day, and blasphemed and destroyed!...>"
