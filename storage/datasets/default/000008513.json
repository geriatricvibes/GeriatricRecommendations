	"description": "He crossed, crossed to a world parallel to Earth.\r\n\r\nThe technology here is synchronized with Earth.\r\n\r\nThe difference is the entertainment industry here is inferior compared to Earth.\r\n\r\nThere are no great poets like Li Bai and Du Fu, and without Li Bai and Du Fu, there’s no great talent like Su Dongpo.\r\n\r\nWithout Su Dongpo’s ‘When will the bright moon come’ poem, there is no Zhi Hu Zhe Ye, the four hit singles.\r\n\r\nThere are no gentleman confessing Yangtze’s love poem, ‘You live near the river’s source, and I where it has run its course”.\r\n\r\nThere are no godly singers like Jacky Cheung or Eason Chan.\r\n\r\nThere are no great folk artists like Dao Lang.\r\n\r\nCompared to Earth, the entertainment industry here is underdeveloped.\r\n\r\nIt all started at his ex-girlfriend’s wedding — let’s see how Ye Huan rise to the top in this world.>"
