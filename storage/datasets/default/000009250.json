	"description": "The Great Cultivator, Chen Fan, had failed to ascend during his Tribulation period, but after a dream, he returned to Earth five hundred years ago, back when he was younger.\n\n“In my past life, I had reached the apotheosis of the universe. I had looked down upon the myriad of worlds, with no one accompanying me. In this life, I wish for both.”>"
