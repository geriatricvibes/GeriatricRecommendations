	"description": "He Chi Yuan’s childhood was not all flowers and happiness; his parent’s divorce led him to swear off any type of romantic love. As a result, all the women who encountered him said the same thing: that he was a cold and heartless man. But who knew that such a cold person could change so much after getting married? After getting married to Ye Wei Yin, a girl average in everything—looks, family status, and achievements—He Chi Yuan fell in love. Plus, even though Ye Wei Yin had predicted that her feelings toward her ex Lin Mu Nian would come to nothing, Lin Mu Nian returned to her side to prove her wrong. \r\nLove has no first come first serve, and so even though He Chi Yuan met Ye Wei Yin later than Lin Mu Nian, his love for her is deeper than what anyone would have predicted.>"
