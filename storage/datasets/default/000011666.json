	"description": "I was reincarnated as a main character in a novel and married to a villain.\r\n\r\nA duke family who was driven away by debts owed by his immature parents.\r\n\r\nThere are people in the book waiting for me…… Alexander’s family, the villain of the original novel who has terrifying rumors, was waiting for me.\r\n\r\nI was planning to properly tame him and then escape when I paid off all my debt, but his reactions were a bit strange.\r\n\r\n“If one of us has to go, let my brother go! Sister will live with us!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t go, sister……”\r\n\r\nThe villain’s younger brother and sister grabbed the hem of my dress and leaned toward me.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know what I liked, so I bought you a craftsman. Do you like it?”\r\n\r\nEven the big-hearted villain’s parents.\r\n\r\nAnd…….\r\n\r\n“What should I do to make me look good on you?”\r\n\r\nAlexandian’s cold eyes also began to change.\r\n\r\nIt seems that they have no intention of letting me go!\r\n\r\nNote: Current MC is reincarnated as the Original Female Lead of the novel.>"
