	"description": "When I woke up after banging my head on the road, I possessed a novel I enjoyed reading. Although not a single line about her appeared in the original, she is the only daughter of a wealthy family with enormous wealth.\r\n\r\nI was embarrassed for a brief moment but later thought that this was a great opportunity. This is my favorite novel, and I can finally meet Locus, the villain of this novel.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this is my only chance to save Locus!\r\n\r\nI clenched my fists as I made up my mind. As long as I’m here, Locus’ life will end happily without any shortage. Especially without being pushed aside by the main characters! I will paint his path with gold!\r\n\r\nTo do that…\r\n\r\n‘Locus had an unhappy family history since childhood.’\r\n\r\nI have to erase this one line from the novel.\r\n\r\nReally, this is ridiculous, why does my baby have to be a villain in the first place?>"
