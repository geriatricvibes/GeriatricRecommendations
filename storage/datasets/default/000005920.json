	"description": "Subjected to a tragic accident, Azora Yuuto passes away only to find himself reincarnated in another world. Being reincarnated as a Hero destined to save the world… would have been preferable. Instead, Yuuto is reincarnated as a High King that rules over demon-kind.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, he’s equipped with 9,999,999,999 HP, 9,999,999,999 MP, 99,999 ATK, 99,999 DEF (and so on and so forth) – total cheater specs that would send anyone running for the hills. If he so desired, he could wipe out the world as a whole. Nevertheless, Yuuto is determined to become a virtuous High King that wouldn’t even hurt a fly.\n\nBut is that even possible…?>"
