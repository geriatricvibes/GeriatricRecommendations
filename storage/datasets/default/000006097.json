	"description": "I possessed the wife of the hero of the novel. Well, so to be precise, as a villainous supporting character and extravagant wife who died at the hands of the hero. \r\n \r\nBut if I treat him nicely from when he was young, wouldn’t he divorce me nicely later?\r\n \r\n**\r\n \r\n“Divorce…?”\r\n \r\n“His Majesty seems to want you to marry the Duchess of Lancaster, and The Empress….She wants it too…I’m just going to be someone in your path, and I just can’t help myself.”\r\n \r\n“So if I give you a divorce, you will run to Noah and cajole him?” \r\n \r\n“What?”\r\n \r\n“Don’t be ridiculous. I didn’t struggle on the battlefield for my wife and brother to fool around. I’m sure you had fun while I was away.”\r\n \r\nWhy did his brother’s name come up?\r\n \r\n >"
