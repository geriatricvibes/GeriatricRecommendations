After being released from prison, the only thing that greets her is her mother's tombstone. Seeing the asshole and bitch getting happily along together like one big family with her birth father and step-mother, she sets out to die together with the asshole and her step-sister in fiery flames. \r\n\r\nThe moment she opens her eyes again, she finds herself back on the very day she was framed. Resolutely jumping out the window and climbing next door, she seeks refuge from the man occupying the room there. But who would have guessed that the man is the brilliant hunk she has always admired from afar in her past life? \r\n\r\nShe vows to rub her eyes clean and be more discerning of people. She wants to make everyone who owed her in the past to pay her back! \r\n\r\n'Young Master Han, can you let me hug your other arm too?' \r\n'Actually, I have one more, do you want it?' \r\n'…'>"
