	"description": "A love of the century produces a rare marriage between the witch Hanella and the holy knight Tarotte.\r\n\r\nHe is an excellent husband who loves his wife and will do anything for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe so too, and everyone envied us.\r\n\r\nUntil I found out about his relationship with Rosearin, his stepsister...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How could you do this to me?! How could you…!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t even think about divorce. Only when I have you, can I stay with Rose like this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, I turned to using forbidden magic to punish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Burn the witch Hanella Reeve Ariel at the stake!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s how my life ended. No, it's definitely over...….\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I went back to before I met Tarotte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this life, I decided to live a new life avoiding the unpleasant ties of the past,\r\n\r\nBut the endless tenacious obsession of the Thearin siblings continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I will be a wicked woman with no blood or tears for you two.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why do I keep getting unnecessary attention from men I have never seen in my previous life?\r\n\r\nFrom the Crown Prince of the Empire, to the next Commander of the Knights,\r\n\r\nTo Ron, the Norwen's commissioner, and even to Igrim, the monster collector maniac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Hanella, who had no choice but to become a wicked woman.\r\n\r\nIn this world, there's no such thing as a wicked woman for no reason.\r\n\r\n>"
