	"description": "Tendou Aoi was a normal girl who liked playing games. She was playing VRMMO『Genesis Frontier』when she found a quest to cut down a giant tree. The tree was too big for a person to cut. It took her about a year to clear the quest. The quest that no one thought could be cleared (even the game administrator). The enormous amount of Exp and Titles was granted to her as a reward. In one night, she suddenly got the same power as the top players in the game. But she was really confused, didn't know what to do. Because until now, she had only been focused on cutting the tree down for one year. Thus she forgot how to play the game normally>"
