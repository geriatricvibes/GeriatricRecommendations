	"description": "Before entering the palace, Gu Yundai got trapped in the kitchen by the crown prince. \r\n\r\nAfter entering the palace, Gu Yundai wanted to use her cooking to eventually incapacitate this jerk. But while none of the crown prince's concubines could even get pregnant, she ended up giving birth to his son. \r\n\r\nGu Yundai hoped to rely on her son's high standing in the palace to get by quietly, and live a leisurely life as his mother once he grows old enough to become the emperor. \r\n\r\nBut after one of the emperor's brothers rebels and many of the royal descendants are killed, her son becomes the only royal descendant... \r\n\r\nAs the position of empress comes closer and closer to her, Yun Dai suddenly feels that helping her son ascend the throne and casting that jerk aside to become the empress is the most satisfying thing to do in life.>"
