	"description": "I got to possess the body of a villainess, whose life was limited to end soon.\n\nThat’s okay, because I can cure the disease!\n\nThe goal is a life, where I can do whatever I want to!\n\nFirst, I decided to educate the characters of my favorite novel. However, the reaction of the people around me, who called me a villainess, were strange.\n\n“How can you laugh like that even though you’re dying soon?”>"
