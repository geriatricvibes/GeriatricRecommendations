	"description": "During my engagement procedure with Nezar, the crown prince of the Caval Empire, I remember my past life as a seventeen-year-old girl.\n\nI cried and clung to Nezar even though he didn’t like me or wanted the engagement.\n\nSince I do not want to spend my later years with him feeling unloved and left alone, I have no choice but to find a lover for him so that I can break off the engagement!\n\nIt’s the only way!\n\nSo why does it keep going in a weird direction?\n\n“Bring the man you like in front of me. I won’t accept you running away. I’ll go all the way to the end of the continent and find you until my blood runs dry.”>"
