	"description": "Cen Sen left for Australia to develop his overseas business market during his first year of marriage with Ji Mingshu.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned home after three years, Ji Mingshu threw a divorce contract to his face in an attempt to end this widowed-like marriage.\r\n\r\nThe man closed his eyes, pressed the sheets of paper down for three seconds in silence, before throwing them back onto the desk. “Mingshu, I respect your decision, but I think I should remind you what was on our prenuptial agreement,” Cen Sen said with a calm expression. “After our divorce, you might not be able to collect the exclusive Birkin handbags, ride a private plane to enjoy Milan’s fashion show, or auction a Sri Lanka 15 karat Padmaraga Sapphire diamond ring so easily…” He continued.\r\n\r\n“Hold on!” Ji Mingshu suddenly realized the error in her judgement. “I think… I can tolerate this marriage a bit longer.”\r\n\r\n--What a pleasure it will be for me to be your most faithful companion for life.>"
