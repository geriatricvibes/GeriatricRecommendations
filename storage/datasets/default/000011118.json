	"description": "He was truly curious about who that soul was, and why he indescribably had such a favorable impression towards her… \n\nWhat made him even more confused was that, in the ten thousand years he was cultivating, he had never seen a single trace of her. \n\nIt was like she had never appeared before, like she didn’t exist in any corner of this world.\n\nGently twirling the jade ring on his thumb, Xie Fei quirked the corner of his lips. He could feel that they would definitely meet again.\n\n He would absolutely catch her then.>"
