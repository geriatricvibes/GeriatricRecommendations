	"description": "I, Wu Qingsong, a world traveller.\r\nI arrived in a world ruled by elves and full of cute beastwomen.\r\nElves should be beautiful and elegant creatures, but the cruelty and indifference of the elves in this world completely overturned my wonderful imagination of them.\r\nAnd those fluffy beastwomen were forced to endure their tyranny.\r\nNo, I cannot just watch while all these things happen right in front of my eyes!\r\nI must lead beastwomen to stand up and bravely resist!\r\nSoap, gunpowder, fertilizer, hot air balloon, steam engine, Master Sun’s Art of War, financial war, faith in God… elves have magic, while I have the knowledge and wisdom of the earthlings.\r\nScience vs Magic, Beastwomen vs Elf, who will win?\r\nEven if I am caught and get tortured by elves, I still have to shout out!\r\nWe will never be slaves!>"
