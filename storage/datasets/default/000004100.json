	"description": "That night she was plotted against by her best friend. Her dazed self was pinned underneath a strange man’s body with endless demands… A night with tumultuous emotions, she thought she lost only her innocence and a former friend she was joined at the hip with. She didn’t think she would also have to pay with her lifetime of happiness! From a company health checkup, she unexpectedly found out she was pregnant at two months. Holding her pregnancy results, Bai Yan Liang tasted a bolt from the blue for a second time. Besides being pregnant out of wedlock, she even doesn’t know who the baby’s father is and hasn’t decided if she wants the child. Another unexpected, destined coincidence happens. She finds out the person who was with her in that hotel room turns out to be the company’s chairman! Liang Xi Cheng! He is A City’s most unapproachable and arrogant, esteemed son of a conglomerate group! His grandfather was a brilliant and well-known respected director, and Liang Xi Cheng is an even more legendary business leader. Of course the most important part is: he is the brother of her former best friend! This awkward relationship gets worse: because her stomach has that unexpected mishap, she suddenly is her ex-bestfriend’s future sister-in-law…>"
