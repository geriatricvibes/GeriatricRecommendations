	"description": "Fii was the first princess of the rural nation, Déman.\n\nOne day, she became engaged to King Roy; an icy king with both beauty and ability, whose management ability was perfect, and who would be perfect save for his coldness towards women.\n\nThe engagement was not really anything for her to celebrate though.\n\nWhy? Because her younger sister with both beauty and fame, whose personality was great, who held a mysterious power and who was a soothing miko had gotten into a marriage of love with said king. And Fii, her twin, had just come along with her as a set bonus.\n\nShe was treated as a stain on the fairy tale, but after a certain event, Fii decided she didn’t care any more.\n\nShe didn’t care about this lifestyle where she never saw her husband even once, where she would spend the rest of her days rotting away in a royal villa.\n\nShe was going to live her second life!\n\nThat was the decision she came to.>"
