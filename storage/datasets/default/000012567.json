	"description": "A fake saintess born by misconstruing the oracle.\r\n\r\nThe evil woman who was abandoned by the deceitful family who deceived the empire and died while committing all kinds of evil because of envy towards the real saintess… That was my role in the original novel.\r\n\r\nAfter learning what happened in the book, I decided. I can’t live in this country because it’s dirty and rude. The only answer is asylum! There should be no criminal charges for a life of adventure, so I’ll just live a good life aiming for the flowery path. Nobody kills anyone, nobody is jealous…\r\n\r\nHowever, something is strange.\r\n\r\nEvery day I hear news about accidents happening to the extras who mocked me and originally died at my hands. But I didn’t do it this time…??>"
