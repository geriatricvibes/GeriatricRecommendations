	"description": "“No…Mama, don’t die.”\n\nIt’s already my 10th life.\n\nI’ve seen my mama’s death nine times, but I still can’t get used to it.\n\nThud. Thud.\n\nI heard footsteps in the distance and hurriedly drew a magic circle.\n\nThen, I finally succeeded.\n\nI’m finally free from the Emperor who abused my mama and me!\n\n“Who are you?”\n\nA handsome man as if made in the image of God.\n\nIt was exactly who I was looking for, the Grand Duke Avelon.\n\n“I made it in time. The search is over. My papa candidate!”\n\n“…What…? Papa candidate?”\n\n“Yes! Please take care of my mama and me!”\n\nIt didn’t matter that he looked at me as if it was absurd.\n\nHe’s the one I picked to be my papa.\n\n“If you do, I’ll make you emperor!”\n\n“Ha…?”\n\n“Because I’m strong!”\n\nYou’re going to need me.\n\nSo take care of us!>"
