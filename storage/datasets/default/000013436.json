	"description": "When Cozette turned five years old, she was given a job she had never heard of \r\n\r\nSlime is such a weak monster that it can be exterminated with little effort.\r\n\r\nHow can I contribute to the territory with this?\r\n\r\nAs Cozette sleeps, at a loss for words, she meets a woman named Chiyo in her dream.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chiyo, Cozette is an evil person who disturbs the main character in the story.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Cozette is accused of lying about her profession and her entire house is destroyed.\r\n\r\nCozette made up her mind. \r\n\r\nIf she was going to be destroyed for pretending, she should not pretend. She should be able to master this unfamiliar profession. She had heard that she could use a sword and some magic. If you're strong, you're good.\r\n\r\nHere was born the daughter of a mobile fortress who trampled everything that stood in her way and left nothing behind after her walk.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Cozette, a lovely young girl who would later become infamous for her infamous names such as 「Princess of All Killers 」, 「 Demon Lady 」, 「 Dragon Slayer 」, 「 One Man Army 」, and 「 Head Collector 」.\r\n>"
