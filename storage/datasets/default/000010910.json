	"description": "My first love was my cousin's beautiful older sister, Aijou Chizuru. But because I moved away when I was in elementary school, I couldn't confess and separated away.\r\n\r\nA few years later. Due to my parents' job transfer, I was sent to my aunt's house to live with Chizu-nee and her sister, Mai.\r\n\r\nBut, when I reunited with Chizu-nee again...\r\n\r\n“I'm not being lazy! I'm just in charging period!”\r\n\r\nShe wasn't the Onee-san I'd always admired, but became a bad Onee-san!\r\n\r\nChizu-nee had made a spectacular debut as a writer for a high school girl, but then she hit a wall and lost her confidence.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to repay my debt to Chizu-nee, I'm going to be her caretaker. ......?!　\r\n\r\nA love comedy about living with my first love and taking care of her!!  >"
