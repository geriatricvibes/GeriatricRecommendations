	"description": "Tosaku Yukikazu was a student in peaceful Japan but during his break, he and his classmates were suddenly summoned to a different world to be warriors.\n\nWhile hearing a mysterious voice the country that summoned Yukikazu and the others explained the world was in crisis and asked them to fight for them offering them a good life in exchange. Due to the words of his classmates, however, Yukikazu was given the opportunity to think about how he should act going forward so he leaves the castle to learn a little bit more about the world.\n\nAnd the result……? He volunteered to become a soldier, hoping to build his own track record and become an adventurer through his own merit rather than be given preferential treatment.>"
