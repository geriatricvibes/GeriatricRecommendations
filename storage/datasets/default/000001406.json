	"description": "Keith Blackhound was expelled from his Order for selling voyeur photos. After that, he wandered around doing random business by making weird magic items, occasionally scamming people by selling his failed products.\n\nOne day, after being discovered selling fake love talismans, he was chased by Temple Knights, ending up lost in the Elven Forest. Happening upon several elves being attacked by a basilisk, he went to help them, expecting food as reward.\n\nHe successfully repelled it with another one of his weird product and, as wished, received food as a reward from an elven girl’s father.\n\nThe father turned out to be an influential person in the kingdom and took a liking to him.\n\nHe was recommended to be Court Magician by him and was accepted.\n\nHis first duty is to teach Elven Princess Naia, who despite being an elf, is unable to use magic.>"
