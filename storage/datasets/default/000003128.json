	"description": "Transmigrating into the world of a supernatural otome game as a phantom. Unwillingly turning into the familiar of an onmyouji and becoming the villain who interferes with love. On the other hand, the heroine happily lived her life without knowing anything. As an ordinary girl who possesses just a little bit of a mysterious power.\r\n\r\n… Until the final day, when that tiny body disappears.\r\n\r\nThe heroine holds the disappearing body in her arms, and makes a resolution.\r\n\r\n―― I’ll take you back no matter what.\r\n\r\n―― For that, I’ll repeat this no matter how many times it takes.>"
