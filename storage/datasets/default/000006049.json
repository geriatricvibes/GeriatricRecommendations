No, no, I’ll cook!\n\n“I’m fine by the corner,” …Come here!\n\nThere’s something you want, but you can’t be selfish? Don’t worry, I’ll buy it for you with the money I worked for!\n\nI don’t know what’s been going on with her, but I’m going to have to keep trying until she opens up her scared little girl’s mind!\n\nNo, really, my girl is too cute!\n\nHey, you kids, stay away from my daughter!>"
