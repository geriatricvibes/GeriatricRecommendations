	"description": "Huang Dan’s sensation of pain is innately different from ordinary people. The littlest tear in his skin can cause him to sweat all over his body in pain, to the point where he is unable to say a word.\n\nSomehow, he began to cross through different worlds, following Mr. System to complete tasks…\n\nIn the first world, Huang Dan realizes what it means to be in such pain as to die, live, and die again.>"
