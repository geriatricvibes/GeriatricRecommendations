	"description": "My favorite internet personality was confiding her interpersonal troubles on SNS. Even though I want to help, I don't actively interact with others, to begin with, and without being able to give any useful advice, my friend Maaya invites me to her house.\r\n\r\nMaaya has a cute younger sister named Miai, but since she usually stays in her room and when I try to talk to her, she runs away.\r\n\r\nHowever, whether it was the cause of an accident that happened today or some other factors, her appearance was different from her usual appearance, and I got involved with the beautiful Maia. Furthermore, does her voice sound familiar...?\r\n\r\nIt's a story about how the relationship between the main character and her friend's younger sister gets a little deeper as they both want to get along better.>"
