Even so, are you alright with me?”\n\nWhen we were done with the marriage, those words I nonchalantly tossed at her. For a moment, she made a face of surprise, before smiling as she assented.\n\n“That’s fine. It’s only a matter if I can get you to fall before that, right?”\n\nHer challenging words somehow made her out as a gallant warrior, making me open my eyes wide for a second. And within the day, I had inputted, ‘the probability I can kill my wife without being found out,’ into my glasses. After entering that simple question, the wearable terminal took in various affairs, computed to a precise value of them, and output a probability.\n\n‘The Probability I Can Kill My Wife Without Being Found Out’\n\n‘0.061%’>"
