	"description": "Su Mu, who is a brocon that does not have a brother, opened her eyes and her brain was implanted with a brain wave No. 38 space-time administrator. \n\nNo. 38 said: “In current novels and idol dramas, in order to impress people, they like to have tragic endings which made the world more and more resentful. Even though we are a FFF branch of the Space and Time Administration, we are not satisfied with it.“\n\nSu Mu blinked, “So…”\n\n“So you have to go to the different worlds and lead the most liked CP to a HE! And broadcast it live to the audience!”\n\nShe pouted, “Not interested.”\n\nNo. 38 smiled, “Maybe in a certain world, you will meet a handsome siscon brother that you would want to marry.”\n\n“Ta–Taboo love?” Su Mu nosebleeds, “I’m going!”\n\nUntil she transmigrated….\n\nSu Mu shouted in panic, “No. 38! My taboo marriage was destroyed by the villainous uncle, he always wants to tease me! What should I do!?”\n\n“Hello, the number you called is no longer in service, please try again later..”\n\nThe uncle smiled warmly, “Baby, try the bra I bought for you.”\n\nSu Mu gritted her teeth, your sister!!!>"
