	"description": "With the mundane ordinary skill “Warehouse”, I spent 15 years as a baggage handler in a party that happened to pick me up.\n\nThat party grew into the strongest party, led by Ryan, a Hero with the strongest skills. Ryan and his team finally succeed in defeating the Demon King.\n\n“Sorry. You’re fired.”\n\nThey said I don’t deserve to be in their party, and I’m sentenced to be fired.\n\nBut there’s a part of me that thinks it’s the right thing to do.\n\nAnd that’s because… I’m weak.\n\nI’m so weak.\n\nI could just barely win a single combat with a goblin if it was unarmed and I had a weapon.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn’t able to contribute at all to the fight against the monsters of the Demon King’s army.\n\nAt the age of 30, I was expelled from my old hero’s party. I have no choice but to start looking for something new.\n\nFor now, I aim to become a great merchant, while working steadily in business, I will try to find a wife. In addition, in this world, polygamy seems to be allowed.>"
