	"description": "After losing my job, I see a senior I once admired in a residential area on a weekday afternoon. She, Shiori Sakashima, has a disease that will kill her if she doesn't keep writing stories.\r\nI want to publish her work while she's still alive. My proposal was accepted, and I began to live with her, her stories, and the flowers that nestled in her head. >"
