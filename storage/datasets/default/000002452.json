	"description": "Born as twins, but Mu Qiqi was left suffering every torment and became the greatest scapegoat in history only because she was not a better actress than her sister! \r\n\r\nThat was when she had a nasty thought on how she would escape her family: she would marry the archnemesis of her own parents. She just never imagined that it would come true! \r\n\r\nHowever, she soon grew addicted to being the enemy’s wife: after the hardship of being the daughter of her parents, for her naughty husband was giving her strength and aided her revenge. \r\n\r\nLife does not get any better! \r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n“Doesn’t payback feel awesome?” \r\n\r\n“It does!” \r\n\r\n“Well, I can make you feel even better!' \r\n\r\n>"
