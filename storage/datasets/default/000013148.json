It’s said that the prince of virtue was brilliant. But all was legend! A fire ruined his wonderful appearance and his legs. Even the talented bride under their marriage agreement were replaced furtively. Ye Liu-li was his bad-luck substitutive princess. She went a long way to graduate from Medical University and had her internship with pain and joy. Who knew that in order to save a suicide patient, she fell off the building and crossed time into a “chessman” of prime minister. She had also been married to the disabled prince replacing her elder sister. On the wedding night, when most other couples were having their romantic night, she was thrilled. It didn’t matter. Revenge never came too late. She would never let go of any of them who entrapped her or harmed her.>"
