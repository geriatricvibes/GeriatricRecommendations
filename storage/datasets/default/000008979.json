	"description": "[A sand sculpture comedy love story that tries to be as outrageously cool as possible]\n\nHe, the Murong Jihua himself, is handsome, rich and taciturn; wildly cool, imposing and generous beyond the stars. His future is bright. His résumé is sublime. In his last life, he died… playing otome games.\n\nThus transmigrated, with the perfect character archetype of ‘Bossy CEO’ on him, he has dedicated himself to capturing his target – his pure little white lotus of a female lead;\n\nAnd has failed time and again.\n\nThe reason, isn’t really our dear bossy CEO not being flirtatious enough, but our rival in love being too overly incredible. The halo of the urban-setting Gary Stu has been profoundly and exhaustively realised on him as he tramples over all obstacles underfoot.\n\n“So profoundly that——this shaoye, I, might actually like him a little?”\n\nThe female lead, “Apparently, the man that was trying to woo me over has suddenly ended up my dad, and ended up with my childhood friend?”>"
