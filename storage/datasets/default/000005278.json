	"description": "Fia, who was aiming to be a knight as the daughter of a knight, remembers her previous life as a “great saint” when she was on the verge of dying.\n\n . . . Huh?\n\n Saints are a revered profession because they’re so weakened and on the verge of extinction, right? \n\nThe only saintly power I use is the ‘lost magic’ that has become a fairy tale.\n\nCome to think of it, in my previous life, the Demon Lord’s right hand man threatened to kill me if I was reincarnated as a saint.\n\nIf I use this kind of power, they’ll know that I am a saint and will probably kill me in one fell swoop.\n\n. . . so I’ll become a knight as per my original intentions! I will live quietly!　\n\nNah, I thought about it, but I’ll use the power I have because it’s too useful . . .>"
