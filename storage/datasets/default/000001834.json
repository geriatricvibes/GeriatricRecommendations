	"description": "Yun is a novice MMO player who equipped only unpopular skills labelled as garbage. However, soon after the official launch of the game, the NPCs stopped selling Recovery Potions. Everyone finally started to notice the importance of Support Magic and Items. And that spells trouble for Yun as well as all the other support-based players. They received orders for recovery potion from endless flood of players en masse, some more aggressive players even go as far as forcing the support players to be their personal craftsman. In order to prevent this from going out of hands, all the support players grouped together to form a community to keep things in order.>"
