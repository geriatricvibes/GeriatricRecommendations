	"description": "The Ninth Prince Qi Changyi inherited the beauty from his mother, the concubine. But this Little Prince is a bit of a fool as he lives in the Imperial Palace with fear that he was being used as someone else’s substitute by his sweetheart. After, being used and tortured…his delicate heart finally turned into ashes. \n\n Pei Zheng, The Prime Minister of the country is a very ruthless and cruel person in everyone’s eyes. Yet he is the closest person to the unfavored Ninth Prince.\n\n “Your highness, who were you looking at in the court just now? Huh?” Pei Zheng squeezed the thin and small chin in front of him.\n\n “No…I didn’t…” Qi Changyi’s eyes were hazy with tears and he claimed in pain. \n\n “Put that charming face of yours away” Pei Zheng’s tone was cold. “Or I’ll let general Zhao know that you’ve always thought of dying while he is on the battlefield” \n\n Pei Zheng always thought that he will always have his little fool in the palm of his hand, but he never thought that one day his little fool would leave him.\n\n “Pei Gege, I’m leaving you…you should be happy”\n\n Pei Zheng, with his scarlet eyes tried to search for his little fool everywhere like a madman, but he always found nothing.\n\n “I won’t…without you, I’ll never be happy in this entire life…where are you Your Highness? I’ll find you”>"
