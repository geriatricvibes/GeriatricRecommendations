	"description": "Everyone knows that mountains are stronger than people! Then, it is natural that the strongest mountain is stronger than the strongest human!? This is the story of being reincarnated into a mountain on Earth 4.6 billion years ago, having to overcome giant meteorite impacts and global freezing, watching the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, using a 'mysterious power' to distribute magic to living things and thus create dwarfs, elves, and beastmen, and then reigning as a sacred peak throughout history.>"
