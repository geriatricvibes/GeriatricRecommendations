	"description": "Claire, an ordinary but lovely lady who works in a small bakery.\n\nOne day, she picks up a purple necklace that has fallen on the road.\n\nShe didn’t even think to find its owner because it looked old at first glance, but Claire says she regrets the day over and over again.\n\nThe owner of her necklace was none other than Clive, the young master of Count of Norton and magistrate of Studehill.\n\n“Take that woman’s personal information. It could be theft.”\n\nShe was going to die of unfairness because she was accused of being a thief, and she was scared to death of that overly handsome man.\n\nFortunately, she was cleared of the charge, but Clive, who continued to hover around her for some reason, was still difficult for her.\n\n“Are you going to buy flowers?”\n\n“No, it’s just a look.”\n\n“Should I buy it for you?”\n\n“… Why?”\n\n“You’re pretty.”\n\nIs this how aristocratic speech is supposed to be?\n\nI’ve met an aristocrat in my life, but how do I deal with this very aristocratic man?\n\nBesides, why are you stopping by the bakery all the time?\n\nWhenever she encountered Clive, Claire’s mind filled with question marks.\n\nAnd she had another question that filled her head.\n\nWho the hell is the culprit in the murder in the town?>"
