	"description": "Kang Ji Geon, while hiding his feelings for Shin Woo Seo, who has a crush on his younger brother, a ring appears, and the emotions he has been holding back are exploding. He approaches Shin Woo Seo to make full use of his resemblance to his younger brother, and he begins a ploy to tie up Shin Woo Seo step by step.\n\nShin Woo Seo has been in unrequited love for his friend Kang Ji Seok for 5 years. As soon as he learns that he has a ring connected to Kang Ji Seok’s older brother, Kang Ji Geon, he desperately tries to hide it in fear that Kang Ji Seok will keep away from him for this reason. He has been struggling with unrequited love for a long time that won’t be reciprocated, but Kang Ji Geon, who has been digging into a corner of his heart, begins to push into Kang Ji Seok’s place.>"
