	"description": "Apparently, I was reincarnated into the world of an R-18 otome game with a reverse harem ending. My fiancé is the villain of the game, and the hidden capture target that opens after the reverse harem route has been cleared. Right now, the carnivorous heroine is in the middle of eating up (and messing with) the capture targets. It’s only a matter of time before the hidden route opens, and when it does, I’ll be poisoned by my fiancé. I absolutely hate pain and suffering, so I’ll ask my beloved fiancé to break off the engagement first.>"
