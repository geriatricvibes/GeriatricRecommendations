	"description": "I believe in you. I’m on your side no matter what.\r\nEven though I hear those words, they don’t resonate in my heart.\r\n\r\nEver since the false accusations of being called a thief in elementary school and a pervert in junior high school, the protagonist, Kanata Hanasaki, is an alexithymia sufferer who has been ostracized by his family and lacks emotion.\r\n\r\nNo one believed in me, no one tried to protect me, and no one tried to help me.\r\n\r\nThen let’s lose all emotions.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a man who has lost his emotions and trusts no one.>"
