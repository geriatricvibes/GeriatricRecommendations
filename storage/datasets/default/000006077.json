	"description": "Five years since I graduated from high school, and within those years, at the same time I was confined by my younger sister, but it all ended when I ran away and died being hit by a truck. At last I’m free from my devil-like sister! Well, that’s what I thought but my sister was reincarnated with me at the same time in the same world. But this time, I’ll escape from my sister’s clutches and live my life in a different world freely. With the strongest weapon and class I received from god.\r\n\r\nGeez onii-san, cheating on me is unforgivable you know~>"
