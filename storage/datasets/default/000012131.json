	"description": "‘Stupid b*tch.’\r\n\r\nAfter a hasty choice, I sold the most precious thing with my own hands.\r\nIn exchange for this betrayal, the only price given was the position of a noble’s second wife and such cruel abuse.\r\n\r\nTessa did not die and instead lived.\r\nAnd seven years had passed.\r\n\r\n“Long time no see, Tessa.”\r\n\r\nHert, who she thought had died, returned.\r\n\r\nHe became a decent man.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n“Do you long for your husband?”\r\n\r\nHert took turns looking at Tessa and the portrait of the old lord he had just seen.\r\n\r\n“What if I killed that bastard?”\r\n\r\nTessa sucked in her breath at the terrifyingly cold voice.>"
