	"description": "The existence of the second child, Karina, who was the successor's youngest twin and the one who wasn't as competent as her sibling, has been concealed by the people around her all her life.\r\n\r\nOne day, she finds out that she only has one year left to live. So, she foolishly visited her fiancé, whom she has never had an exchange with.\r\n\r\nAlong with the divorce papers that he longed desired for.\r\n\r\n“Frankly speaking, I want to stay here for a year.”\r\n\r\n“..... Are you crazy, Miss?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll break off the engagement.”\r\n\r\nBut she didn’t know at that time.\r\n\r\n'It seems that you keep trying to pretend that you don't know, so I should definitely tell you then.”\r\n\r\n'Pardon?'\r\n\r\n“I am fond of you.”\r\n\r\nIt didn’t occur to her that she would receive attention and affection from him without anything in return. So she comes to desire this much for a life without regrets.\r\n>"
