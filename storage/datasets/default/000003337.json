	"description": "Ye Xi crossed over into a typical idol romance novel as the villainess.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of her safety, she decided to distance herself from the male and female protagonists while silently observing their real-life version of a school idol drama. Everyday, she would repeatedly ridicule the main protagonists in her thoughts, along with their group of friends and fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s not surprising, however, that the male protagonist’s special ability is to hear the voices of other people’s thoughts. So he listened to all kinds of curses that Ye Xi secretly harbored and recorded them one by one.\r\n\r\nExpressionless Male Protagonist: the future is long, your debts will slowly be collected.\r\n\r\nYe Xi covers her ears: I’m not listening, not listening, *recites Wang Ba’s Sutras*>"
