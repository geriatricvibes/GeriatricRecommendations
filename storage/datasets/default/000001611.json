	"description": "Song Yu has three requirements for Yue Zhishi:\n\n– You cannot call me gege in public.\n\n– We won’t do anything together in public.\n\n– You cannot let other people know you live with me.\n\nYue Zhishi has always been obediently following these rules. They were practically strangers at school. At the opening ceremony, he suddenly collapsed due to an allergy-related asthma attack, sending everything into chaos. At this moment, the student representative Song Yu suddenly stopped speaking…….\n\nThat night, a hot post appeared on the school forum.\n\n【Shock!! Our junior high school department male idol and our senior high school department male idol are actually ‘brothers’!】>"
