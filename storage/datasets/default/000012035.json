	"description": "\r\n\r\nOn the day he became an adult, Rondo, an illegitimate child of the house of Margrave Édouard, was ordered by his father to commit suicide through poison. Due to the Édouard family valuing magical talent above all else, someone like Rondo who has no aptitude in any of the four elements of magic did not deserve to live. As he gulped down the poison in despair at his weakness, he realised his talent in poison type unorthodox magic. But while poison magic is powerful, the spells he can use right now are weak. All around him at this moment are the guards, as well as the brothers and sisters who shun him. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn order to survive– what should he do?\r\n>"
