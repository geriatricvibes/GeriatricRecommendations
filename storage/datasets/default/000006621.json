	"description": "Bai Mo, you evil bastard! \n\n'Only the weakling will care about race and lineage, that’s because they need to see something that is similar to themselves to feel safe. And they need to use another life to continue their dreams; But the sun doesn't need another sun, and the eternal one doesn't need another to realize his own dreams.'\n\nA story of a lone seeker constantly searching for a way forward.>"
