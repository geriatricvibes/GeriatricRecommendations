	"description": "Inexplicably, she had crossed over to the end of the 1970s and was thrown into the mountains. Fortunately, she is rescued by a handsome soldier. Only later does she discover that Brother Soldier is actually the unlucky male supporting role of a historical novel. He was used and deceived by the heroine in various ways and finally dumped on the grounds of the progressive new era not supporting arranged marriage.\r\n\r\nDamn, will such a good Brother Soldier will still end up like that in the future? If the heroine doesn’t want him, then step aside and let me have a go.\r\n\r\nBut how will we live in a time that lacks modern food and clothing? Hey, I bring something different, now I can guide this male lead to be well-fed and make the heroine get mad.>"
