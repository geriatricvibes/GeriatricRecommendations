	"description": "That night, I listened to the hymns till dawn, not for serenity, but to seek a sliver of your soul;\n\nThat month, I flipped through all the scriptures, not for enlightenment, but to touch the pages where your fingers once lingered;\n\nThat year, I knelt on the grounds, my head embracing the dust, not to pay obeisance to the Gods, but to feel the warmth you left behind;\n\nThat life, I wandered through ten thousand great mountains, not in search of an afterlife, but to cross paths with you –\n\nGao Fei, will you believe that I lived through this night, this day, this year, and this lifetime, only to hold your hand and accompany you in this journey of life?>"
