	"description": "The summoner Lion has just been fired from a Hero party, as usual. Since his summoning powers are limited, it turned out to be yet another place where he wasn’t needed.  As Lion travels in search of a job, a mysterious man with a tremendously intimidating air starts following him around.\n\nUm, why is this person following me?\n\nThis is a story of a no good summoner’s struggles, taking place on a continent where the demons are governed by four demon kings in the west, east, north and south. \n\nIt’s a fantasy RPG about a chuunibyo summoner.>"
