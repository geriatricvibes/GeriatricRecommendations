	"description": "Chi Jiayan, a 'heavenly fiend lonely star'[1], had met the Grim Reaper when he was very young.\n\nAt that time he was crying in an embarrassing situation, as he looked so adorable, the Grim Reaper, without a hitch… bought him an ice cream.\n\nLater, Chi Jiayan became an adult and his birthday wish was—to be the bridegroom of the god of death??\n\nGrim Reaper: I refuse.\n\nChi Jiayan: What, refuse? Then I will reluctantly become your bride. (^-^)\n\nGrim Reaper: …\n\nThis is a story about a human courting the Grim Reaper and taming him.\n\nGrim Reaper: This human being might be poisonous.\n\nNote:\n[1]heavenly fiend lonely star- idiom which means bane of others’ existence (also translated as ‘an orphan who causes others misery’)>"
