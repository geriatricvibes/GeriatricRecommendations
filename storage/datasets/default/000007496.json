	"description": "The entertainment industry has recently released a newcomer with a peculiar style— \n\nOthers are on entertainment news, he is on social news;\n\nOthers rush for endorsements and roles, he has good resources and loves to accept it is totally self-willed;\n\nOthers try their best to sell themselves, speculate on topics, and hire naval forces. He has his own topic physique, and there is big news everywhere, and the entire network is running water. \n\nSuch an unusual operation aroused much attention, but when they asked about the reason for the success, the person replied this way— \n\nBai Xinyan: Probably because of… cuteness?\n\nOthers: ? ? ? ! Although you are really cute, you really don’t have an AC number*… [Nothing to say.jpg] \n\nThe criticized Bai Xinyan is slightly heartbroken: Am I right to tell the truth? [Wrongly drop the long ears.jpg]\n\nOthers: …yes, yes! You are so cute, everything you say is right! [Awesome.jpg] \n\n——————————\n\n*Don’t take yourself too high / Don’t have a shame at all>"
