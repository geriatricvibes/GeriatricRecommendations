	"description": "Obtaining the power of flight, invisibility, and teleportation―― Kirishima Ren was sent to another world.\r\n\r\nIt was a world of swords and magic. I was able to survive in the seedy underworld using my supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nOne day, while stalking…… er I mean, protecting stealthily from the shadows, I ended up raping the princess. While treating my princess as a sex toy, I became involved with cute girls one after the other.\r\n\r\nFrom manipulating a tomboyish witch, to taking care of a troublesome cat girl while entrapping two elf sisters. Little by little, I had reached my hand to the center of the country.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I was able to take hold of the King’s weakness and tried to do anything as I pleased. And now, I’m going to invade the love hotel… I mean, the castle.>"
