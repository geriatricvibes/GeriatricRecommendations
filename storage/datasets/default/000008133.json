She is also the pearl in the palm of the Xiao family, which dominates the Interstellar Xiao Group. She did, however, find herself in the 1970s, a time when resources were scarce.\n\nCrossing into the 1970s isn’t the only surprise she got; she’s now married to someone!\n\nOn the wedding night, when she first arrived, Xiao Xiao, who was confused and burning from fever, was carried to the health center by her skin-and-bone “husband”.\n\nYou can’t eat good food or wear nice clothes, not to mention the bad state of the environment. But worry not, Xiao Xiao will solve it by scientific means. \n\nTechnology is productivity. She was a boss in Interstellar, and she will still be a boss here!\n\nAs a “monster”, Wang Wei deeply felt that marrying his wife was trouble. On the first day of their marriage, he spent five yuan treating his little wife’s illness.\n\nThe little wife of his is also very delicate. She has no idea how to do anything and acts spoiled on a regular basis. Wang Wei keeps a record of every time he helps her with something. He expects to receive it back in the future, but he wasn’t expecting that…>"
