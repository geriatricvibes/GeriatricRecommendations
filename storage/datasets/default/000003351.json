	"description": "She possessed the fiancee of the Male lead who transforms into a beast in a tragic novel.\nShe plays the role of a Villainess who dies at the beginning of the original story.\n\nWhat did she do? She ran away faster than light.\n\nBut then got caught…….\n\nHowever, there is no giving up in my dictionary!\n\nI thought hard, thinking that I could run away again if I break down the Male lead’s walls.\n\nWhen the Male lead suffers from nightmares, she’ll sings a lullaby.\nIf thinking that he’ll turn into a beast, comfort him and ease the curse.\nIf he gets hurt, she’ll treat them.\nWhen attacked by the enemy, they fought and stood by together.\n\nNow, it’s really time to run away!\n\nBut the Male lead is being strange.\n\nEven the original heroine and the Villainous Crown prince are all around me.…?\n\n* * *\n\nAslan looked at his face in the mirror.\n\nHe looked around carefully to see if there was any blood on it.\n\n“I wonder if she’ll like this.”\n\nThere stood an attractive man in the mirror.\n\nThere were no signs of a terrible massacre.\n\nUnder the perfect suit fit, the outline of solid muscles were clearly revealed.\n\nAslan had never paid attention to his appearance.\n\nFor him, it was as worthless as the ants on the street.\n\nUntil he thought of wanting to seduce Vivian.>"
