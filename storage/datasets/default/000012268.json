	"description": "Luo Tang in Ancheng No.1 Middle School is sunny and white, and full of youthfulness, but he is also the school overlord with a cold personality and considerable fighting power.\n\nIn order to take Luo Tang down a notch, bullies from other schools gave him the nickname Tangtang.\n\nThis name succeeded in becoming a minefield for Luo Tang.\n\nBut according to a classmate, she heard with her own ears a girl who was not afraid of death and called Luo Tang, Tangtang, and instead of exploding, Luo Tang ran up to her, tail wagging.\n\nClassmate A: Wagging his tail? Do you think Luo Tang is a puppy?\n\nClassmate B: He’s a puppy, a soft dog among giant dogs, like…golden retriever!\n\nWei Ruxia OS: He isn’t a golden retriever, he’s a little wolf, super fierce!\n\nNote: The 'tang' in Luo Tang and the Chinese for sweets/sugar sounds the same.>"
