	"description": "150 years of life after being reborn as a high elf, who I thought only existed on fiction.\r\n\r\nIt took 30 years to realize that I had been reborn, and after 120 years of just munching on berries and taking it easy, I finally decided to head into the outside world.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an ambiguous existence with a lifespan of over 1000 years — a restless high elf living leisurely as a human.>"
