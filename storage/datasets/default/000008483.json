	"description": "His Royal Highness the prince is a gentleman.\n\nHe has all kinds of strange hobbies.\n\nFor example:\n\nHe likes to sneakily lay down on the ground when nobody is paying attention and enjoy the fresh air, all with a blissful look on his face.\n\nHe loves all sorts of soft things to the point when he even slightly touches one, he looks like he could melt into a puddle.\n\nMeanwhile, he secretly collects various kinds of cute things (black lace panties with a cat tail, bras with a little pink bell, fuzzy bunny ears, etc.), and in the middle of the night when nobody is around, he’ll take out his collection of treasures and slowly admire them.\n\nBecause he isn’t that old (not really), occasionally he will express some chuunibyou.\n\nOur prince truly is a mysterious young man.\n\nOh right, I almost forgot the most important thing —\n\nHe likes this witch.\n\nA testimonial from the witch: “That bastard kneels on the ground for no reason whatsoever and rubs his face against my butt, and from time to time he makes sneak attacks with his dirty hands! …What?! Y-You want me to wear this neko outfit?! Please go die!!“>"
