	"description": "Ten years have passed since Michika transmigrated to another world at the age of eighteen. Now almost thirty years old and working as a traveling merchant she has managed to accumulate a lot of wealth from selling rare ingredients and due to her special skill. \n\nHowever, Michika was tired of living alone and wished for a family.  \n\nSo one day, when she encountered a woman whipping a young lizard boy who was wearing a slave collar, she impulsively ended up spending all of that day's earned money to buy him from his master.\n\n“Well, lizard boy, won’t you become my child?” She offered, planning to adopt him and have him become her son.\n\n(But, I’m a dragon…)\n\nAnd four years later, Michika, who by then was a thirty-two-year-old lady, was suddenly pinned down by her eighteen-year-old child who then confessed his love for her. \n\nBeing told of his love… she ran away.>"
