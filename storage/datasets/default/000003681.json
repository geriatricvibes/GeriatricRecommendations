	"description": "An impetuous and shameless woman, hiding in a man’s bedroom, shame of the imperial family…\r\n\r\nIt was a word to express the perfect and beautiful second prince, Franz’s wife, Aleisha.\r\n\r\nShe loved her husband, despite his ill-will and affair…\r\nFranz killed her.\r\n\r\nAleisha placed a curse on Franz just before her death, and she returned to the past.\r\n\r\nThe new life was all the same.\r\n…Except for Franz.\r\n\r\n“I’m not worried about you, it’s me. If I lose you, I will go crazy.”\r\n\r\nCould the curse be wrong?\r\n\r\nShe tried to live as if she didn’t have Franz in her previous life.\r\nHowever, he kept grabbing her.\r\n\r\n“I have no other woman but you. So, let go of your false hopes.”>"
