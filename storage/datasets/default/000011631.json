However, he can’t read the room, he’s narcissistic, he provokes people spontaneously, he hates losing, and he’s selfish.

However, because the person himself has a needlessly strong mental fortitude and positivity, he doesn’t reflect on it at all.\n\nWhat suddenly came into such Asch＝Dahl’s life was, a request from Hogner Magic Academy’s Board Chairman for him to be teacher.
