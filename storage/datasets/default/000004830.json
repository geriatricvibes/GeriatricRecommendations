I have millions of methods for the protagonist to choose from!\n\nA smart, tenacious gong with only romance on his mind X an arrogant, sharp-tongued yet soft-hearted shou. There is the same gong in each world.\n\nA funny and cute plot with the gong in charge of face slapping Mary Sues along with a shou that’s in charge of being as cute as a flower.>"
