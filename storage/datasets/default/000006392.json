	"description": "A senior at the Academy, Rebecca Zion.\r\nEvery time she sees Prince Lance, her stomach churns.\r\n\r\n-The Prince, doesn't he look cheesy?\r\n\r\n-Not at all?\r\n\r\nMy friends disagreed with me.\r\n\r\nI became the Prince's partner in art class.\r\n\r\nI feel nauseous whenever I look at his face, but I can't believe I have to draw a portrait!\r\n\r\n-What should I do? Tomorrow is the due date for the assignment, but it is still not complete.\r\n\r\nDespairing from the crisis of failure, the Prince whispered to her.\r\n\r\n-See you in the art room later tonight. Without anyone knowing.\r\n\r\nYou're definitely going to be a model, aren't you?\r\n\r\nBut Rebecca, who visited the art room in the middle of the night, found him.\r\n\r\n-Beck, have you ever tried anything like this?\r\n\r\nA seductive prince!\r\n>"
