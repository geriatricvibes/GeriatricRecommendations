	"description": "Yan Xiaoxuan has no ability and no looks, and eating like a glutton was one of her abilities, sleeping a lot was one of her abilities, and her biggest wish was to marry a man who could fill her stomach!\n\nIn everyone’s eyes, he was the fifth crown prince who fooled around without a care in the world. He wears a snow white outfit, all just for the sake of displaying his worth to her alone. She was cold and proud, and as subdued as water. He was willing to give the world away for her.\n\nShe said, “I can’t tell what you’re thinking, it’s also hard for me to block you, if you are able to threaten something that is important to me, I will obey you fully…… until I die.”\n\nHe said, “I hardly find anything I hold dearly, but once I do, if it dies, I will personally send it into its grave.”>"
