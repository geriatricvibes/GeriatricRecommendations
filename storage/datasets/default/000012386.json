	"description": "He transmigrated because of a necklace. After transmigration, he discovered that the world is a mysterious fantasy. He turned into a dragon from ancient Chinese mythology, and he was not a pure breed.\n\nLater, he discovered that it didn’t even matter. What’s more pathetic was that he was mol*sted by a dirty brat every day after he was adopted. Later, he found out that didn’t even matter either.\n\nWhy did this brat always think about how to capture him when he grows up?\n\nWhy did this dragon, who oppressed him when he first met, take advantage of a dangerous situation treat him like this?!\n\nWhy…\n\nWell, he knew that females were very rare in this world, but even so, this brat didn’t have to think of him as one. Right?!>"
