	"description": "Hi. Am I your first fairy?\n\nI met a lonely child, very deep underground.\nI wanted to see the kid smile.\nSo I was born as a flower fairy.\n\n“I’ll promise. I will get out of here with you!”\n\nYou are a seed trapped in the ground.\nIn the name of the flower fairy, I will surely make you bloom.\n\n“Yes. Let’s work together. Let’s go out together… Take each other out of here.”\n\nTo escape with the cute boy, the fairy has a lot of work to do!\nWe prepared hard for a long time.\nAnd finally, an opportunity came…\n\nWe were finally out into the world.\nThe whole world coveted my human being in full bloom.\n\n“You are too great for me to have.”\n\nMy first person.\nMy precious planet. My beloved flower.\nThe origin of the fairy, Shrensha, was Leoren.\nI was going to let Leo go a little, very little, for Leo’s life.\n\n“Leo is the greatest in the world. I’m just Shrensha from Leoren.”\n\nLeo knew only me.\n\n“Shrensha, please sign a contract with me.”\n\nForever.>"
