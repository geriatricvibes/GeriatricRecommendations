	"description": "When you have possessed a character in a novel, even a wicked woman is possessed by aristocratic love.\r\n\r\nShe possessed the final monster the male lead has to kill, the devil’s daughter.\r\n\r\n“It’s your favorite finger necklace!”\r\n\r\nThe Maas whose basic base is kidnapping and murder.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t live with these guys for 5,000 years.\r\n\r\nHang in there, just play the role as the original and go to the next novel!\r\n\r\nGod, can there be such a coincidence? I can’t believe I’m picking up a man.\r\n\r\nBesides, what eight-year-old Kiel says is unusual.\r\n\r\n“You can eat it.”\r\n\r\n“Hey… I’ll raise you hard, so come and kill the devil’s daughter later.”\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHe appeared like a ray of light on the dark mausoleum.\r\n\r\nYou have to kill me like in the original.\r\n\r\n“I’ll do whatever Bella wants, so… come next to me.”\r\n\r\nHe’s becoming more and more obsessed with me.\r\n\r\nHis slender fingers grazes his knuckles, touching his deep heart.>"
