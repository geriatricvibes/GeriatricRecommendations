	"description": "It was winter.\r\nOn the way home from work with chilly winds, I found an abandoned cat in a back alley.\r\nThe distance between the cat and me which I unexpectedly picked up slowly grows closer as spring comes.\r\nOne day, however, she suddenly becomes a 'she'...\r\n\r\n'Good morning. Breakfast is ready.'\r\n'Welcome home. I've heated the bath for you.'\r\n'Good night. Can I hold your hand and sleep with you today?'\r\n\r\nWhen I came home, I lived with a cat. Before I knew it, my days had turned into days of being pampered by her.\r\nThis is the story of an ordinary, kind man and a cat that he found. The warm daily life of a man who never changes and a cat who is worthy of his time.\r\nA sweet and gentle love comedy about the two.>"
