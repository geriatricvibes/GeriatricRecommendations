	"description": "A young boy, born with blocked meridians, has never made any progress even after ten years of persistent practice.\r\n\r\nYet it is also this very young boy who distinguishes himself from all disciples in Qishan and shocks the whole world. On his way to the pinnacle of power, he, the immortal betgod, domineeringly slaughters his way out and wins the hearts of beauties of all kinds. Be it the lovely type, the charming and enchanting king of thieves, the noble and determined saintess of Demonic Cult or the heroic beauty of righteous sects…they all fall for him.>"
