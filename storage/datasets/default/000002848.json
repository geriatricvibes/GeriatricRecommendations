	"description": "Spiritual energy allows all things to strengthen and evolve. God seemed to have closed the door on humanity when humans discovered only they could not absorb spiritual energy. But while one door closed, a new window opened. Humans gained the ability to contract spiritual beasts!\r\n\r\nAfter hundreds of years of evolution, under desperate situations, mankind has established 20 shelters to resist monsters! In this era of beasts, only beasts symbolize honor, wealth, power… \r\n\r\nQin Yu, whose abysmal F- talent does not allow him to contract beasts, decided to take a unique road, a road that only belongs to him! Lose humanity, lose a lot… Lose savagery, lose everything!\r\n\r\n“I have lost my humanity. As for savagery…” 　　\r\n\r\n“I have too much!!!”>"
