	"description": "Many years later, Shen Yi told Su Tang that his eyes lit up when he saw her for the first time. She was wearing a warm yellow dress and her face and her cheeks were blushing as if she walked out of a Japanese anime. \r\n \r\nSu Tang asked, “Which anime?” \r\n\r\nShen Yi’s eyes smiled and used sign language to spell out the name of the anime: “Pokemon”. \r\n\r\nSu Tang: “......Divorce!” \r\n\r\nShen Yi quickly added: You were full of energy. \r\n\r\nSu Tang: “......I'll take that back.” \r\n\r\nThis is the story of a big hearted female lead and a deaf and mute male lead. \r\n>"
