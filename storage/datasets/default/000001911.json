	"description": "Mo Tianliao was a master weaponsmith and a demonic cultivator. When news spread that he was about to complete a divine weapon, cultivators from both the demonic and orthodox sides chased him down and killed him. In a stroke of luck, he managed to possess a new body and was reborn.\r\n\r\nSo what was the first thing on his mind after his rebirth? Avenging his death? Taking over the world?\r\n\r\nMo Tianliao: I have to find my cat!\r\n\r\n—\r\nMo Tianliao: Why won’t you let me hug you? You used to be my cat!\r\n\r\nMaster: (unsheathes claws)\r\n\r\nMo Tianliao: Ahaha, this disciple has too much respect for Master, this disciple can’t bear to let Master walk on the ground!\r\n\r\nMaster: (lifts paw, sends disciple flying)>"
