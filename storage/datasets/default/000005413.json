	"description": "At 3 years of age, her father went missing. At 15, the muscle in her hand snapped. At 16, her mother passed away in a car accident. At 19, she was framed by her uncle. At 22, she was burned alive by her newly- wedded husband and her best friend. Perhaps it was God’s sympathy that allowed her to return to the time when she was 15 years old to re-live once more. The previous lifetime of being low- key and having forbearance resulted in betrayal and misery. In this lifetime, she must be lofty and domineering to let those who have bullied her suffer a terrible end!>"
