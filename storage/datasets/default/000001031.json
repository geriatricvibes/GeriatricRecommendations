	"description": "Once a week, Miyagi pays 5,000 yen to her classmate Sendai.\n\nThe 5,000 yen is to buy three hours of Sendai’s time, which gives the right for Miyagi to give her orders.\n\nMiyagi is at the bottom of the school caste while Sendai is at the top. The two, who never crossed paths at school, spend time together after school under such a contract.\n\nMiyagi’s orders are determined by her mood of the day, and Sendai cannot disobey.\n\nOne day after school…\n\nMiyagi calls Sendai to her room and gives her an order that she usually does not give.>"
