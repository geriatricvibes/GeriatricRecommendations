	"description": "The swaying of lakes; the pleasures of life.\r\n\r\nOne is a master of martial arts who sees through the world’s emotions with a heart like a clear mirror.\r\n\r\nTranscendent, pure and reclusive, born for the good of all, yet understands the truth of life.\r\n\r\nAs if everything is nothing, all but a vast emptiness.\r\n\r\nA level of martial arts so great that it is in an other-worldly state. One could even consider him a god.\r\n\r\nAs the saying goes — perfection needs no decoration.\r\n\r\nA unique and charming appearance.\r\n\r\nA heart of ingenuity that kills all quarters.\r\n\r\nHowever, Luo Xuan, who was like a pool of deep, still water, was injured by Liu Li’s emotional entanglement.\r\n\r\nA love that drove one insane, even hate itself was a crazed feeling.\r\n\r\nA fight between water and fire.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it was nothing but a loss for both sides.\r\n\r\nA mere cloud of steam blown away by the breeze.>"
