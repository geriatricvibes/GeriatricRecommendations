	"description": "When I post a video of myself performing as a woman on the Internet, I become famous as a mysterious high school girl Internet musician (though I'm a guy). However, my secret is discovered by my music teacher, Misao Hanazono-sensei, and I'm forced to work around her to keep her mouth shut... My high school life, which was supposed to be tasteless and odorless, was turned upside down by three girls I met through Hanazono-sensei.\r\n\r\n- 'Rinko, the twisted genius pianist'\r\n\r\n- 'Shizuki, the flower-arranging princess drummer'\r\n\r\n- 'Akane, the school-skipping vocalist'\r\n\r\nBoy Meets Girl, a story of love, youth, and bands!>"
