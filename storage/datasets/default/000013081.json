	"description": "Satori, a spirit who can read people’s minds, was always alone. Satori hid his face behind his long bangs and would always stare at his feet. He grew his bangs until the bottom of his nose so that his appearance wouldn’t be seen by other spirits.\r\n\r\nOne day, a boy appeared in front of Satori…\r\n\r\nThis is a love story between Satori, a disliked spirit who can read people’s minds, and Sousuke, a bold and kind-hearted announcer.>"
