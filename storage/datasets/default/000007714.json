	"description": "Adelaide, a succubus who inherited an F-class dungeon along with its massive debt.\n\nIn order to pay off the debt and avoid forfeiting an arm and a leg to Lucifer, she had no choice but to manage the dungeon.\n\nShe thought it was certainly impossible.\n\n“Are you my master?”\n\n“No, I’m just the master of this dungeon…”\n\n“Yes, that’s right. If so, you’re my master.”\n\nSomehow, she gained a perfect manager as soon as she arrived in the dungeon.\n\n“Don’t touch that unsightly bastard. Eat me instead.”\n\nPresenting oneself as nourishment was one of the greatest predatory demons in Devildom.\n\n“I brought the prince’s neck as an offering to you.”\n\nAnd offering her a legendary adventurer she didn’t even ask for.\n\nOkay. If it has already come to this, then the goal is to become S-class!>"
