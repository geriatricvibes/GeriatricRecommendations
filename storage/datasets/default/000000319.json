	"description": "I was forced to live in captivity for the rest of my life because I happened to be aware of the fact that I was a saint. I was truly a 'real' saint, but that didn't matter, because there was already a designated saint in the temple.\r\n\r\nWhen I died from all the abuse I endured, I was sent back to a time before all those previous events in my life had happened. After 15 regressions, I was exhausted. I prayed, 'I don't want anything to do with this, so please just let me die,'\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment when I could finally be able to die, someone said, 'How about being my daughter?'\r\n\r\n.... That monstrous duke had adopted me.>"
