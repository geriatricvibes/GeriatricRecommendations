	"description": "In each world, there would be the ultimate blackened female lead called Lin Xia, and each of them would’ve drowned in the light of their first love, aka the moonlight. Unsurprisingly, all of these moonlights were beautiful, attracting the love and adoration of Lin Xia, but in each and every world, the moonlight would eventually leave in the end, ultimately causing the blackening of Lin Xia’s fragile heart.\n\nYears later, when the blackened Lin Xia finally fell for another woman, the special memories of the moonlight which was buried deep within her blackened heart began to fade, replaced by the light of the true soulmate.\n\nAnd when the memories of the moonlight faded to almost nothing, the moonlight returned abruptly, only to be rejected by the moved-on Lin Xia. Filled with a crazed sense of jealousy, the moonlight began to destroy the new couples’ lives, only to be hated entirely and finally, crushed cruelly by the angered female lead.\n\nAnd this is where the story begins, as a world-hopper, Ye SangSang would complete her missions in these worlds.>"
