	"description": "Ashiya Kaoru (35) was once called the genius surgeon. However, due to covering for his best friend’s medical malpractice, he lost it all.\r\n\r\nOne day, while net surfing, he came about to a certain website by coincidence.\r\n\r\nAfter jokingly filling out the empty fields, he decided to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes…….it wasn’t his familiar room, but a completely unfamiliar different world.\r\n\r\nNot only that, it was a different world without much advancement in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe status he inputted into the site now reflected on himself. Using present day medical knowledge and recovery magic, he’ll relive his life.>"
