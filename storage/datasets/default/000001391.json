	"description": "At first, it was a dream without any omens.\n\nThe scenes in the dream corresponded one by one with reality, and it was then that Jian Chi realized that he was living in a danmei novel.\n\nThe protagonist in the book was naive and weak, surrounded by wolves in the noble boys’ school, and finally ended with a 1vN forced love ending.\n\nAnd he was the vicious male supporting character in the story, who framed the protagonist everywhere and ended up miserably.\n\nJian Chi, who became self-aware in advance, decided not to mix with the protagonist’s feelings, and strived to be a transparent person who had no sense of existence in the aristocratic boys’ school.\n\nBut who knew that he didn’t have to take the initiative to provoke others, but troubles would come to him one by one.\n\nWhen the plot continued to develop in the direction of collapse, Jian Chi finally found that the Lead Gongs’ eyes were a little different when they looked at him.>"
