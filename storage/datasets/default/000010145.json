	"description": "I didn't know at the time.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this place where I opened my eyes is the world in the novel, \r\nand that my existence is like 999 extra characters when I don't appear in the novel with a single name.\r\n\r\nIt is also an unfortunate extra that was killed early by the male lead, who is a psychopathic duke.\r\n\r\nWhen I realized that the boy my father bought for me was a child, who was destined to kill me, \r\nI tamed the future Duke of Psychopath so hard for me not to die.\r\n\r\nA year later, he left me, \r\n11 years later, he reappeared in front of me.\r\n\r\n'Long time no see, sister.'\r\nCasillar's hand held my ivory hair.\r\nHe quietly kissed my hair in his hand.\r\nWith a face like a male beast who is satisfied with victory.\r\n>"
