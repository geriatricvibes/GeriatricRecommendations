	"description": "Arthea, the saintess, was being assaulted. The sight of her begging for help in front of him brought back memories for Roy. \r\n\r\n'This is bad!'\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing he ran away in a hurry, but as soon as he was caught and interrogated by the capture targets, he became aware of something. \r\n\r\n'Could it be, I'm the villainous noble son?'\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to Roy after the confession drug had made him say more than he should have?\r\n\r\nIs the villainous noble son supposed to be in this position?\r\n>"
