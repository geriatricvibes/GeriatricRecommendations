	"description": "Mu Jin grew up in modern times and had been an outstanding person who helped the grandmother to cross the road since childhood.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she had become the cross-dressing villain boss of the novel she had just finished reading. Her name was Mu Jinwen and she was the malicious and feminine fake eunuch of the great Yan Kingdom. Yet after transmigrating, she bound a qualified supporting character development who ordered her to protect the main characters as she completed her role to maintain the stability of the world.>"
