	"description": "The main character, Kei, was taken to a strange place while he was sleeping on a bus during his school trip.\r\n\r\nThe sea in front of him and the forest behind him, a place that you wouldn’t come on a school trip.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be thrown into nature even though I was on the bus in the first place!\r\n\r\nSuch an isolated island is actually a place full of fantasy, with some mysterious apps installed on his smartphone, job selections, and levels, an environment that seems unrealistic at all.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the rabbit got provoked, and there is a huge spider in the forest. This smells like the scent of a battle.>"
