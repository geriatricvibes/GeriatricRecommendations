	"description": "Las Vegas, mid-twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFew people have seen the true face of the new mafia godfather Ilya Lucio. He is simple, quiet, hard-hearted, and he is a flower in a high mountain.\r\n\r\nNo one knows that this beautiful godfather has a secret, and this secret is his greatest weakness.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep this secret, he desperately climbed up and wanted to stand at an unreachable height until no one dared to give him a half-coveted heart.\r\n\r\nAnyone who dares to look at him will be killed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are always so few people who are not afraid of death.>"
