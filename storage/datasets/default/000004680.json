	"description": "Shortly after her nineteenth birthday, Florence was told that she was incapable of bearing a child. It was a fatal flaw for the daughter of a nobleman.\n\nShe was about to give up on life, thinking that she would have to become the wife of a man who was not much older than her father.\n\nSuddenly, Stanley, her father’s squire, who had been like a brother to her since she was a child, was chosen to be Florence’s fiancé.\n\n“They say you and I are to be married.”\n\n“‘Yes, sir. Yes, I’ve heard that.”\n\nThis is a story about two people who had a master-servant relationship, but gradually came closer to each other after their engagement.>"
