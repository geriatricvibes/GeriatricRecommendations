	"description": "『She’s always putting on that grumpy face even though she’s not actually that upset! Oh, why can’t she just be honest with herself…!?』\n\n『She is a tsundere, after all? When her embarrassment levels exceed a certain limit, she will explode into anger. However, the point that she's suppressing under the surface is that she wouldn't mind that sort of thing if it were in a less public place.』\n\nAs Endo-kun passionately reacts to the antics of Lady Liselotte, the villainess of an otome game, Kobayashi-san provides a painstaking breakdown of her tsundere behaviour.\n\nSuddenly, one person could hear their voices; Liselotte’s fiancée, Prince Siegward.\n\nThat is where this story begins.>"
