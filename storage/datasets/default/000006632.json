	"description": "The nemesis that Ji Ran had been unable to stand for many years has finally gone bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAll his scoundrel friends asked him, what now?\r\n\r\nJi Ran laughed coldly, you still have to fucking ask him?\r\n\r\nOf course, it’s to use this opportunity to torment, humiliate, and trample upon him.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Ji Ran waved an arm and threw a card towards his nemesis in mad glee, saying that he’d ‘sponsor’ him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the next day, he sat up in bed with a dumbfounded expression. Feeling a sore ache in his body, he recalled the bitterness of last night, as well as their ‘fight’ and the tears he’d wept...\r\n\r\nFuck your mom.\r\n\r\nMotherfucker.\r\n\r\nQin Man, you dog, I’ll kill you!>"
