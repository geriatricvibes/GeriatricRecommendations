	"description": "How does it feel to find out that all your dorm mates are big shots on your first day of school?\n\nHao Yun has the most say in this matter.\n\nHaving been chosen by the Otherworldly Expert System, he unexpectedly obtains the ability to see the future potential of others. He discovers that his roommates are all future big shots with explosive potential.\n\nThen why should he work hard?\n\nWouldn’t just being cozy with them solve all problems?\n\nNormal people would think that way, and Hao Yun is no exception.\n\nHowever, just when Hao Yun thinks that he can easily become a winner in life as long as he cozies up with them, he surprisingly finds these so-called big shots are quite fragile.\n\nAnd these great artists, superstars, academics, and the richest people in the world, who finally reach the pinnacle of their lives with the help of “coincidences”, can’t help but feel lucky when they are interviewed. They are glad that they had such a hidden expert by their side…\n\nHao Yun: Great, after all this, I am actually your fortuitous encounter!>"
