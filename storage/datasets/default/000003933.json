	"description": "—What’s a virtual alpha? Does that mean they’re not a real alpha?\n\nSou still couldn’t accept the fact that he was an omega.\n\nOne day, someone at the verse clinic recommended him to play an app called “Virtual Alpha”.\n\nHe has a strange relationship with Yuugo, an AI Alpha who was a bit of an airhead. As they spend their days together, Sou began to have feelings for Yuugo.\n\nThis is a doting omegaverse story about the two until they get together.>"
