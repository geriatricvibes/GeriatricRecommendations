	"description": "When we met for the first time in our first year of high school, he saw my contempt, but silently continued to clean;\n\nIn our second year, he kneeled in front of me while enduring the ridicule of others, “Can you please beat me up to vent your anger, then forgive me?”\n\nFrom then on he would calmly fulfill our appointments: that horrible wound in physical education class, his guilt when he wore three layers of pants, the bruised and battered body that presented itself before my eyes, then I carried the trembling him…….\n\nIn our third year, we fell out because of the anger from being betrayed – but now that I think about it, how could that have been betrayal, why did he dare to be friends with me? Even though it was because of my rejection that he once again had to endure violence, what hung on his lips were still “I was the one who lied to you, it’s my fault for making you angry.”\n\nShi Yan couldn’t help but lift his head up and control the heat in his eyes, while his ears were still ringing from He Nuo’s words that were filled with gratitude, “You are the one who treats me the best!”>"
