It seems that my missing sister reincarnated to another world and sent her to pass on a message___\n\n“Do you like me? If so, in which world do we get married together? I ruled this city because of you.”\n\n….It seems that to materialize her marriage to her brother, she went to another world and became invincible to break the city’s rules.\n\nThat’s right, my sister [seems to be] the strongest ruler of the other world.>"
