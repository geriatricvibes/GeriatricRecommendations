A nepotism bastard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the twists and turns, I was selected as an SR entertainment trainee,\r\n\r\nThe debut group “DIAS” member’s mentality was ruined by some kind of incident!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he lies down, he’ll get a penalty.\r\n\r\nThe misunderstanding was that he was nepotism because he took the place of a trusted former leader,\r\n\r\nThe members who are in a group panic state just before their debut!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘This guy and that guy are all full of problems.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the 2nd idol Jin Haon be safely recognized as a member of “DIAS” and be able to stand on the stage?>"
