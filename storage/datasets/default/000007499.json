	"description": "Yu Sawatari is a high school student who has fallen ill after a painful accident.\n\nHe was having a hard time. Then his childhood friend Kokoa Shirayuki, who lives next door, decided to take care of him for an unknown reason.\n\n“Why do you want to take care of me all of a sudden?”\n\n“I’ll leave if it bothers you?”\n\nAfter that day, the two, who had been growing apart, come closer.\n\nYu’s wounded heart is healed through his interaction with her.\n\nEventually, he is drawn to Kokoa.\n\nThis is a frustrating, sweet and slightly sad love story between a boy who has lost his love and a childhood friend who had a crush on him for a long time.>"
