I’m not obligated to sleep with you!”\n\n… Makes no sense the concubines are left idle, instead wanting a criminal awaiting execution like me to waste energy both mentally and physically.\n\nSomeone said: “Really? – – An Yi is surprisingly very righteous!”\n\nNot lightly nor heavily, he lets out a decree: “If you don’t want to sleep with me, then off with your head!”>"
