	"description": "The later generations immensely revered Great Wei’s Jianan Emperor. During the period of his reign, Great Wei entered its golden era. \n\nInterestingly, all the records that glorified his accomplishments unanimously agreed that Jianan Emperor had only one flaw in his life: He favored only the imperial noble consort! \n\nZhou Tong was very annoyed. She time-traveled out of blue, didn’t even have time to take a breath, and yet, already had to deal with trouble. \n\nWhat? The original owner of her body was a walk-on cannon fodder? She couldn’t even be regarded as a second female lead? \n\nZhou Tong is angry! Change, it must change! This plot needs a beautiful turnaround in order to be worthy of this big sister’s coquettish personality! \n\nThis is a story of the unfortunate time-traveling lass who possessed the body of a reborn aboriginal maiden and became the Great Wei’s beloved imperial consort.>"
