	"description": "I had known for most of my life that I would be killed by a Yandere and now, that day has finally come — or that should have been what happened. Instead, I was reincarnated by a Goddess in a game-like world.\r\n\r\nI jumped at the opportunity to live a normal, peaceful life with ordinary girls… Now I have a skill that awakens Yanderes!? The world the Goddess created specializes in Yanderes!?\r\n\r\nOn top of that, in order to gain a certain cheat ability, I was born with a body that can’t harm women no matter what they do to me… I wanted a peaceful life in this world, but it seems even in a different world I will be loved to death by Yanderes.>"
