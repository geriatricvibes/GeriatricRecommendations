	"description": "In the glorious modern 21st century, an old fogey who’s stayed up in the mountains for who knows how many years borrows a body, carrying pocketfuls of silver dollars, and heads down into the city for the sake of reviving his sect.\n\nThen he realizes that in order to revive his sect, he needs land, housing, renovation, workers, insurance…. a whole mess of items. Modern entrepreneurs really have it rough. Earning money is hard, working is hard, and when his stomach grumbles, he can only sustain himself on the likes of wandering souls and wild ghosts.\n\nThe Wei family’s eldest son, beaten by his father and neglected by his mother, was sent back months after going missing. But his personality has undergone a major change, his mood became unstable, and his martial abilities turned extraordinary. Anyone who rubs him the wrong way will inevitably receive a beating.\n\nNeither an obedient child nor a serious actor anymore, instead engaging in superstitious activities all day long. How could things have gone this far?>"
