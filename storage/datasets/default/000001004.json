	"description": "The young single man, Xu Zhao, recently graduated from university and was ready to embark on a major task at his job when he was suddenly transmigrated to the eighties where there was no internet or tv. It would’ve been fine if he had no money, but he unexpectedly had a two-year-old son as well: one he birthed himself.\n\nThe son had nothing to wear.\n\nThe son had nothing to eat.\n\nThe son had no toys to play with.\n\nThe son didn’t even have a “daddy.”\n\nHow would the son live without him? Xu Zhao decided that he would raise the son.>"
