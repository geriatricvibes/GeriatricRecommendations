Then lie down and spread your legs.”\n\nLee Joo-hyuk’s dedicated guard dog, Kwon Yihyeon.\n\nAlthough he is a dominant omega, his pheromone gland was damaged due to an unexpected accident, leaving it unscented\n\nHe was confident that he would do anything to protect his alpha Joohyeok, who fell apart when he was young, but he looks so different now and could not even recognize him now that his scent has disappeared.\n\nHe thought it wouldn’t matter if he didn’t recognize him, as long as he could keep his lost mate by his side.\n\nHowever, Lee Joohyeok becomes increasingly harsh on the devoted Kwon Yihyeon.\n\n“I can do anything to protect the managing director.”>"
