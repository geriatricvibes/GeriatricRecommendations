	"description": "Gu Bai always believed that the s*upidest thing he had ever done was listening to his bestie’s words of becoming a stallion genre novel writer. Directly following was the most frustrating thing that he had ever done, changing the previously decided upon moral, smart, healthy youngster into a big boss…\n\nIn the end, he discovered that the consequences of changing the original plot were more serious than he expected.\n\nAfter meeting the pervert he wrote himself:\n\nGod Damn! He eats people ah! At this time the cannibalism I wrote can be replaced with “eating human beings” right?\n\nIn short, this is a story about a dumb author who wrote a cannibalistic story which started as a stallion story, who in the end was unable to escape the whirlpool of destiny (not really).>"
