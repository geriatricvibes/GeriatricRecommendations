	"description": "Touma Shirogane is a savior―although he is now a commonplace homemaker.\n\nThe Organization for the Rebirth of Humanity―Ouka. It is the last remaining sphere of survival for the human race, which has been defeated in the battle against the spore beasts and driven underground in the lowest level of the《Academic City》, where the people’s only hope, the《Magic Knight》, is being trained.\n\nTouma’s daughter, Yukina Shirogane, was admitted to the《First Magic Knight Academy》, where the most elite of the elite gather, as the strongest S rank in the history of the academy with the highest stat values in the exam. After leaving the battlefield, Touma tears up at the sight of his beloved daughter, whom he has quietly watched grow up, but one day he receives a top-secret order.\n\n“You are to attend the school with your daughter. This is a direct order.”\n\nThe world’s strongest daughter and her father who is ostensibly a commoner. The story of their bonds and the storm that awaits them begins!>"
