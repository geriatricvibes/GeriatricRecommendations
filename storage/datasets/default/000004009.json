	"description": "I reincarnated as the wicked older half-sister of the female lead of a rated-19 novel.\n\nAnd here, I’m destined to die at the hands of the obsessive male lead.\n\nSo, I desperately tried to prevent my sister and him from meeting each other…\n\n“Sisterhood is a wonderful thing.”\n\nLike a beast, the golden yellow eyes shone dangerously in the dark.\n\n“But Evelyn, it’s time for you to know.”\n\n“Cas, Lord Cassius…”\n\n“I only wanted you from the beginning.”\n\n...How did it get to this point?\n\n***\n\n“All I need is my sister. I don’t care about others!”\n\nSomething was strange about the original female lead, whom I thought was only kind and gentle...\n\n“My son is too soft for you, but I will do anything to get you inside my house.” \n\nProspective mother-in-law, who was a little more outcoming than her son…\n\n“Evelyn, why don’t you love me?”\n\nAnd, even the original male lead...!\n\n...I’m just struggling to survive, but everyone is obsessed with me!>"
