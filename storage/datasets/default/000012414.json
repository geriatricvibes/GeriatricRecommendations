She had a dream she wanted to achieve no matter what…but what should she do to achieve her dream despite her bad grades?\n\nThen came Makoto Ichiyanagi. A classmate of hers who, though good in studying, had poor social disposition. She dubbed him as the “God of Study”\n\nShe requested him to help her in her studies. As a result, Madoka’s grades improved from the study method Makoto taught.
