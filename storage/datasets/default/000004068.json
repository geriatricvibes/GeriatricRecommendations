	"description": "The continent has been engulfed by darkness, the days are without light . Sol leaned on an empty ruin and watched the barren landscape wither into the distance. Some say this is an age that even the gods do not involve themselves in. Others say, that in fact the gods have long since departed and abandoned the people. There’s no light, and it’s either kill or be killed. No one can really be free, we will eventually be bound by some things and then die.>"
