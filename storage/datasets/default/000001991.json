	"description": "The man watching the moment it was born was silent. He was a snake (that is also a black mamba), but his child was born a baby bird.\n\n–\n\nI fainted and suddenly woke up as a baby bird. And if that’s not enough,\n\n“Who made my daughter cry? I’ll twist their neck right away.”\n\n“Quiet, you don’t have to talk. I’ll sweep every last one of them. I’m sure it’s one of them.”\n\n“Calm down, both of you. My sister has a weak stomach, so let’s take care of it in the back.”\n\nThey’re all overprotective!>"
