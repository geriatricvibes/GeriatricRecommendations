	"description": "Kuon Sakuya (male) enjoyed yuri so much he’d imagine that the protagonist (female) and the villainess in dating sims were flirting.\r\n\r\nThat Sakuya fell down the stairs because of overwork and lack of sleep, and the next thing he knew, he was reincarnated into the villainess from the dating sim “Blooming Flowers in Love”, Kujou Sakuya.\r\n\r\nIf he continued on the path “Blooming Flowers in Love” Kujou Sakuya was on, destruction flags would be waiting. Sakuya started avoiding destruction flags so he could flirt with all the other ladies that appeared in “Blooming Flowers in Love”.>"
