	"description": "Qin Zhaoyue, a hundred-year-old Soul cultivator and famous artifact refiner, dies and transmigrates into a body of 16-year-old Xi Zhaoyue, who was killed on her wedding day.\n\nThe unlucky previous owner of the body was an illegitimate daughter of an influential family and was forced to live her whole life in the orphanage. However, at the age of 16, her Guide glands were awakened and as fate willed it, Xi Zhaoyue happened to have the highest compatibility with the youngest, bravest, most handsome Major General of the Empire, a dream husband of the whole Outer Space! Finally, a loving family she so longed for was within her reach… Yet, at the wedding ceremony, her Mental sea was invaded and she died.\n\nOnce Zhaoyue figured out the situation she landed herself in, she vowed: she wouldn’t be a proud and self-respecting cultivator, if she didn’t strive for independence, for the right to live the life freely! Cultivate, refine, get stronger! Become your own person!>"
