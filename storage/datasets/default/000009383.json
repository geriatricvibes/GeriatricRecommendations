	"description": "One day, a junior high school student, Kaneki Ryo, came across a website on the Internet that contained a “10-question Psychopath Diagnostic Test”. At the time, he was beginning to realize that he was out of alignment with those around him, so he answered the questions casually. This was the result of the questions and Kaneki’s answers.>"
