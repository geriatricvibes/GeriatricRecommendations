	"description": "After entering high school, 'Ice Lady' Himuro Fuyuka moved to a room next door to Kagami Asahi, who started living alone in an apartment which was just a short walk away from the nearest station.\r\n\r\nShe always kept her distance from everyone, never spoke to anyone beyond what was necessary, and always maintained a straight face. A lady that was as cold as ice or so Asahi thought.\r\n\r\n“..I can't eat anymore, munyamunya...”\r\n\r\n“Where did the ‘Ice Lady’ go…?”\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the two of them continued with a mysterious connection.\r\n\r\nThey share dinner at night, go out together on holidays, and eventually whisper sweet things to each other.\r\n\r\nStaying beside the blunt but caring Asahi, the ice that covers Fuyuka slowly but surely melts away.>"
