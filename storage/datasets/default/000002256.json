	"description": "He is the heir of Di Hao Group; decisive, cold-blooded yet dotes on his wife a little too much.\r\n\r\n“Husband, I think I want to rear a pet. What do you think we should rear?”\r\n\r\n“Rear you.”\r\n\r\n“Husband, I want to change bed sheets. Which material do you think is the most comfortable to sleep on?”\r\n\r\n“You.”\r\n\r\n“………”\r\n\r\nZhuang Nai Nai: Can’t he speak properly for once?\r\n\r\nOne day, somebody asked the man, “Why are you always the first one to bow your head every time you two fight?”\r\n\r\nSi Zheng Ting: “I am 185 cm, she is 165 cm. Of course I have to bow down to speak to her.”\r\n\r\nTo put it short, this is a story about a black-belly president, his wife and their effort to conceive children after marriage.>"
