	"description": "The ancestral grave of the Su has great feng shui; others bow and beg for sons, but they can easily have nine. When they wanted a daughter, Su Ran Ran is born. As the only daughter, she’s treated and treasured like a princess, rendering her a bit mischievous and spoiled. To help protect her from her brothers’ bullying, she’s sent to Zhu Mountain as a disciple.\r\n\r\nAlas, she’s all grown up and the family struggles to get her (and her cousin) married. When she learns about a new potential marriage, she tries to run away but is caught off guard after accidentally poisoning a young man in white. Brought home, her potential partner arrives and to the side, he greets her with, “I don’t plan on marrying you, please drop that thought.” Rejected. It’s not like she wants to marry him anyway. She’s always pondering why they want to get her married so soon.>"
