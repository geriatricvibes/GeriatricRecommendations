	"description": "Souya, the manager of a trading company in a small city, is a 37-year-old office worker who enjoys single life.\n\nOne day, when he wakes up in a strange meadow, he sees two moons floating in the night sky and regains the memory of being transferred to another world 20 years ago.\n\nAn uncle’s adventure in a different world, wearing a business suit, with a low amount of tension, a high level of ability, and a cool but slightly pathetic personality. It’s a different world transition, but it may have an old-fashioned fantasy atmosphere.>"
