	"description": "Miss Su had lived a sheltered life focused on learning the three obediences and four virtues since she was young. Before she could marry, she was killed by the autumn rain. Reborn as a peasant girl in the 1980s, Su Danhong became a wife and also unexpectedly got a spiritual spring! She didn’t expect that her previous life’s embroidery skills were master level embroidery skills in this life? The master was not a master. Miss Su didn’t care. What she cared about was that she could use these skills to make money and not worry about clothes and food. Growing precious flowers and plants, embroidering beautiful mountains and rivers, and enjoying the simple life. \n\nThis is the story of an ancient girl from a noble family who went through rebirth to the 1980s where she farmed and gave birth.>"
