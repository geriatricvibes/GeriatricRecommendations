	"description": "I became the stepmother of Rebecca, the 5-year-old wicked girl who planned to commit all kinds of debauchery because of her limited time due to an illness.\n\nSoon, I’m going to get severely hurt because of Rebecca.\n\nIn my second life, I can’t believe I’m going to be crippled and unable to live properly for the rest of my life.\n\nAs expected, the Duke’s appearance exceeded my expectations.\n\n“Get lost.”\n\nI just went to your side, is there a need to swear?\n\n“My mom? As if! Such a rotten being. Get out of my house!”\n\nSplashing water at me, why does my daughter have a mother-in-law style that is typically seen in a morning drama?\n\n“Don’t cross the line. I don’t like you.”\n\nEven the Duke, who brought me over himself, loathes me.\n\n***\n\nNasty and cheap humans.\n\nI’m out of here!\n\nI made up my mind and started to do what I wanted.\n\nAfter taking a little revenge on a kid who does not even apologize, let alone feel remorseful, all that's left is to run away….\n\n“Mom, you can’t live without me, can you? I’ll grant you a special place next to me!”\n\n…No. I don’t want to be next to you.\n\nEven that girl’s father and the Duke, the man who hated me to death, was acting strangely.\n\n“I hate you so much. So I’m going to put you next to me.”>"
