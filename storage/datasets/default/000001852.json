	"description": "There are twenty independent stories written by twenty different authors, sharing the common theme of 'April'. \r\n\r\nAn anthology that is considered a rare item as it has never hit the shelves as a standalone book. There is no ISBN and it is an unbuyable except in online auctions. The anthology was published as a bonus gift to Dengeki Magazine readers in 2009.>"
