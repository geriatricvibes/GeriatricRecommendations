	"description": "The third prince, Callus, was born with the curse of death in his body.\n\nThe curse is eroding his body day by day, making it impossible for him to walk. That was until he had an encounter with a magician. By then his life was forever changed.\n\nLight Magic.\n\nBeing this as the only magic that can contain the curse, Callus decided to become the magician’s apprentice to fulfill his wish to live a normal life.\n\n“If I don’t do anything, I will die. I will do my very best to not let that happen!”\n\nThe hopeless boy burned with the fire of determination.\n\nLight Magic is a legendary magic that is rarely used, and it is impossible to master it in a short period of time. However, being on the brink of death for who knows how long, the magic power in Callus’ body had grown far beyond that of an ordinary person.\n\nMoreover, because of the curse, he was able to see “spirits” that’s invisible to ordinary people. With these, he grew at an astonishing rate!\n\nThis is a tale of a cursed prince who grows up surrounded by blessings.>"
