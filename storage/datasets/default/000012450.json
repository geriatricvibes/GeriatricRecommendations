	"description": "Chi Xiaoduo is a single man who seeks after a high intrinsic quality of a person in love. At the age of twenty-six, his love history was still blank. In his endeavor to increase his experience, he met Xiang Cheng, who had come from the countryside and entered the big city in an awkward situation.\n\nChi Xiaoduo, a mola fish, was instantly subjugated by his lofty and handsome image and worshiped this man as a male god. After several encounters, he surprisingly discovered that this male god was not only extremely handsome but also had an unknown profession – an exorcist.\n\nRight now, Chi Xiaoduo felt somewhat ruffled by the spring breeze of love.>"
