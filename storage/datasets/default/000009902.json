	"description": "“The red light district suits you, not the Imperial Palace.”\r\n\r\nHe was insulted over and over again, but he still couldn't get used to it.\r\nEvery time he heard such words, he had to stop the rage that burst out inside him.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Prince, Clarence, was not the main character of this banquet.\r\nHe was just an easy-to-play with commodity doll.\r\n\r\n“I guess it’s true that it’s your first time, seeing how tight you are.”\r\n\r\n“Uh… huh… too big… it hurts… .”\r\n\r\nHe thought something like this would happen someday.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not know that the person he would first experience it with would be the Duke of Barden, whom he met for the first time today.\r\n\r\n“It seems that the prince has no pride, swallowing even my semen.”\r\n\r\n“A while ago, were you trying to be sassy by shoving your ass at me like a dog in heat?'\r\n\r\n“Your Highness, do you find pride in sucking up cocks of flesh and semen without hesitation?”\r\n\r\nThe string of reason that he was barely holding on to suddenly broke.\r\n\r\n“It is my pride to survive like this.”\r\n\r\nThe past life, in which I had to do everything in order to live, was not at all shameful.\r\nEven if that means accepting that man's penis.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything you want to do by using such an ugly way to survive?”\r\n\r\nThe one who tries to somehow survive, and the one who insults him.\r\n\r\nWhat is the end of this dangerous relationship?\r\n\r\n>"
