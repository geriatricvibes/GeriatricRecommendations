	"description": "She randomly grabbed a man off the streets after finding out her step-mother had been plotting to marry her off to a forty-year-old man. “Do you want to marry me?” Jin Liyuan’s girlfriend had just stood him up, so his lips curved into a small smile as he said, “Sure. I just happen to have my household registration booklet with me.
