	"description": "I possessed the wife of the Emperor, the mad villain of a tragic novel.\n\nAfter a while, when the evil Emperor looks to be obsessed with the saint who appears, I will vanish as if I was never here at all. Because the moment the blind villain meets the Saint...\n\nHe won’t even remember that I exist!\n\nI really did nothing.\n\nI just stayed very quietly in order to not incur his wrath… \n\n***\n\n“I’ll give you a choice.”\n\nThe corner of his lips raised crookedly. Though that smile did not reach his eyes at all.\n\n“One, return to the palace with me…”\n\nHis gaze was enough to unnerve me.\n\n“Two, let me kill all these men who have hidden the Empress of the Empire for treason… then, return to the palace with me.”\n\nNo, hasn’t the saint already appeared?\n\n…Why are you doing this to me?>"
