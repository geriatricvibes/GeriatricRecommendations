	"description": "I am Karne Pivoine Feian, a poor and pitiful princess in hiding. Due to some unfortunate circumstances, I’m currently residing in the house of a Baroness under a hidden identity. I promised I’d do anything they asked me. But I didn’t think I’d be asked to do things that would put my life in danger! As expected, freeloading in someone else's house is no easy feat. I've got no choice. I have to find a way to reclaim my identity!\r\n\r\nOne day, a handsome man approached me to offer a deal.\r\n'I’ll give you an unimaginably great reward if you bring me what I ask of you.'\r\n\r\nI think I've already found my reward, though! I've not only gained money, but an absolute hottie as well. Will I finally be able to walk down a path of happiness?>"
