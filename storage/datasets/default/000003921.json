	"description": "“I, Evelyn Felice will abdicate as the Empress.”\r\n\r\n“You’re giving up your fortune without my permission, and you’re happy at will.”\r\n\r\nBut a year later, like a coincidence, Fabian appeared again.\r\n\r\n“Our relationship is done…Please stop.”\r\n\r\n“I seemed to be the one who would do that. Everything…I decide.”\r\n\r\nThe relationship, which was thought to have been neatly arranged, began to get entangled again. Fabian’s indifferent eyes were burning hot toward Evelyn.>"
