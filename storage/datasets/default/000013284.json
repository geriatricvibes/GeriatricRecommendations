	"description": "The second floor of the gym – this was where we always met. It was class time, but of course, there weren’t any classes going on in a place like this.\r\n\r\nThis was where Shimamura and I became friends. We hung out here – talking about TV shows and cooking, playing some ping pong….This is where we fostered our friendship.\r\n\r\nKeeping my head propped against the wall, I let out a small sigh.\r\n\r\nWhat was this feeling? Yesterday, I’d dreamt of me and Shimamura kissing.\r\n\r\nNot that I’m like that. I’m sure Shimamura isn’t either. It’s not even something worth repeating myself about, but really, it’s not like that.\r\n\r\nIt’s just that when she hears the word “friend”, I want her to think of me first. That’s all.>"
