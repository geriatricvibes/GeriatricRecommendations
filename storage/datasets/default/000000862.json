	"description": "The school is a training ground for people who become part of the Fantasy world. Unfortunately, very few people have <<Warrior>> or <<Wizard>> types of 'Character', a large majority of people can only become a <<Villager>>.\r\n\r\nI, Satou, am also one of the <<Villagers>>. One day, I attracted the attention of a girl bearing the characteristics of a <<Maou>> - Ryuugamine Ouko. She is cute as well as nice and courteous, however, she will unexpectedly say 'I really want to exterminate human kind' or other similar phrases. I really wish she could change a bit. I am also the childhood friend of a maddening and rebellious <<Hero>> - Hikarigaoka Tsubasa, a person who would always bring about trouble. She is a super beautiful girl. Whenever she thinks of something, she will recklessly and thoughtlessly advance forward...\r\n\r\nAs the person caught in the middle, what should I do?!>"
