	"description": "Twenty year old Hahyun who stopped dancing for some reason, was invited to join the survival show, ‘SURVIVAL ID’ at the request of his PD Uncle. He originally thought he would be easily eliminated due to a full profile picture as a requirement, but to his shock — the reaction towards him basically flipped the whole internet upside down. Hahyun is getting closer to his debut despite him not even wanting to do so.\n\nAfter a while, Hahyun gave up and finally debuted. Of course he didn’t expect things to be all smooth…\n\nAs soon as I debuted, I got a confession from a member from the same group.>"
