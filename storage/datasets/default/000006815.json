	"description": "Rachel, a tomboy whose hobby is experimenting with magic.\r\nEthan, a childhood friend of Rachel is the subject of her experimentation.\r\n\r\nAfter drinking a suspicious potion which Rachel gifted him,\r\nEthan fell asleep and woke up with an ominous energy. \r\n\r\n 'Who's next to me?' \r\n\r\nWith her silky ultramarine hair scattered everywhere, \r\nThe woman who was deeply asleep, smelled of fragrant flowers. \r\n\r\n“...... Rachel?' \r\n\r\nLike his lost pupils, his voice scattered and trembled in the air.\r\nWith her white shoulders exposed, she said with a small breath. \r\n\r\n“...... darling?' \r\n\r\nEthan's face, which was like a stone wall, fell to pieces in an instant.>"
