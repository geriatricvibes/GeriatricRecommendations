Although previously she had been in the prime of her youth, living as a Japanese high school girl, she ended up dying in a traffic accident. After reincarnating, she is now living in the deranged world of an Otome Game where all the Capture Targets are Yanderes! Moreover, since she is now the Heroine’s love rival, her death flags are everywhere and her most likely cause of death is the Capture Target that is currently her servant! Forced to interact with cute boys that are likely to kill her, how will she survive?\r\n\r\nThe following is the story of how this cheerful and compassionate girl nonchalantly avoids these death flags.>"
