Unfortunately, a fire burns everything she knew into nothing. Left with nothing, Fu Rou and her family follow Sheng Chumu to Chang'an to start anew.

Determined to stick to her principles, Fu Rou has to navigate through schemes while staying true to herself. With the troubles of the court, will Sheng Chumu ever be able to reunite with Fu Rou?
