	"description": "This is the novel behind the TV series, “Love Like the Galaxy”. Slightly different from the TV series, the book is about a modern young lady, Yu Cailing, who somehow ends up in the body of Chen Shaoshang, a young lady in ancient China. This story chronicles Yu Cailing / Chen Shaoshang’s adventures through life, her loves and her laughs with her family and romantically complex men.\n\nAn excerpt from the author’s own synopsis:\n\nMany years later, when she looked back on her life, she felt that her birth in this life was much better than in the previous life. What was the reason for such a serious and diligent person to embark on such a tricky road?\n\nAs for the answer to that question, we will only discover when we read the novel!>"
