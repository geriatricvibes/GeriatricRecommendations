	"description": "With the start of a boarding school life, and as a first-year student, he unluckily falls into a situation of having no living quarters to stay in. Accidentally stumbling across the legendary ‘haunted house’, and furthermore inadvertently releasing a forbidden seal–\n\n“Human! You actually dared to trespass…”\n\n“I’m really sorry! Are you the owner? Can I pay the lodging fee?”\n\n“……Haven’t you realized the difference of us from normal humans?”\n\n“Uh, you all look exceptionally handsome?” (⊙∀⊙)ﾉ\n\n“……╬”\n\nFor a (beep–) goal, the demons decide to pretend to be students and sneak into the school. Due to a (beep–) reason, the boy is forced to live in the residence for a certain amount of time.  The demons who do not know the affairs of life meet a zealous and simple boy and accept the overly chaotic affairs of the school + living together, which is where the story ardently begins!>"
