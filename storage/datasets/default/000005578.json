	"description": "Dias is a simple man who lived his life following his parent’s dying words to a T. He fought for his country for 20 years, and at 35 was suddenly called the Patriotic Hero.\r\n\r\nThe king gave him land, but he was dumped in the middle of nowhere without a penny to his name as the pitiful lord of the grasslands.\r\n\r\nLuckily he was found by the mysterious Oni folk, who helped him in his first steps to live life as a Feudal Lord in these frontier lands.>"
