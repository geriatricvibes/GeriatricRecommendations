	"description": "Reborn as a sister of a villain with no blood or tears in a war-fiction novel.\n\nAnyway, that guy, who plays ‘my brother’ role, is a villain who will be sealed by the Main Lead after losing the war. So I just need to pretend to be his little sister until he disappears.\n\nNo, at least that’s how I think …\n\n‘Something in your right hand, is that the main lead’s head?’\n\nMy brother won the war.\n\n***\n\n“What’s with the suitcase?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\nAt the tip of Dietrich’s long finger, there was a package that I had wrapped up as soon as he left for the battlefield.\n\n“I asked what it is.”\n\n“It’s, It’s a travel bag, brother.”\n\n“Travel?
