	"description": "\r\n\r\nIan, who was a hitman, finishes his last mission and drives the knife across his neck.\r\n\r\n[I've never seen the place where I woke up after I stopped breathing.]\r\n\r\nSomewhere with strange people and endless dark forest.\r\nOne could occasionally hear crying at dawn.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he realized that he was in someone else’s body named ‘Ian’, the high gates were opened, and he met the owner of the mansion, who had blue blood on him; the color of the serpent. \r\n\r\n'I've been worried a lot since you got back covered in blood.\r\nIt's good to see you breathing fine.'\r\n\r\nHis hair disheveled and as dark as the night. Tall, dark skinned with slender eyes, the aura around him felt slightly dominant. \r\n\r\n [Ah, he’s the man I had already killed.]\r\n\r\nIan realizes the moment he looks at his face,\r\n\r\nHe can't think of his name or the reason why I killed him.\r\nThe man had a suspicious attitude….\r\n>"
