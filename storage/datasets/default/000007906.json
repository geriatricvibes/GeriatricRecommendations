	"description": "Ten thousand years later, ice has melted. The Soul Federation Scientific Exploration team found an egg with a golden and silver pattern on it in the far north of the land, and after examining it with an apparatus, they found out that there were vital signs inside. They hurriedly brought it back to the institute for hatching.\n\nThe egg hatched, but it was a baby, a baby exactly the same as a human – a baby born out of an egg.>"
