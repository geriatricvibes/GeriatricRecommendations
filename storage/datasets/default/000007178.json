	"description": "Scarlett, the daughter of great watchmakers is the wife of Viktor Dumfelt. \r\n\r\n“There was a drug used to sharpen memories in your wife’s tea.”\r\n\r\n“…drug?”\r\n\r\n“Overdose could lead to amnesia.”\r\n\r\nWhile she was interrogated by the police, she loses her memories because of those who opposed Viktor’s return to the royal family.\r\n\r\n“By the time you get out of here, you won’t remember what happened here.”\r\n\r\nA week of missing memories. And the secret Viktor hid, revealed in the newspaper.\r\n\r\n“You betrayed me.”\r\n\r\nScarlett couldn’t find the words to explain, because nothing came to mind. Eventually, she decides to divorce Viktor.\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, my love.”\r\n\r\nThat was how their relationship seemingly came to an end.\r\n\r\n“Why do you keep coming?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t want me to come, come back.” \r\n\r\nHe had been indifferent all this time, but now, he hung around her with an unfamiliar look on his face.\r\n\r\nExpressionless, Viktor slowly spoke, “I’m going to get you back.”>"
