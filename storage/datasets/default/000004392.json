	"description": "After the death of Fu Sinian, Yu Duo’s heart shattered into pieces. As his widow, she was the recipient of Fu Sinian’s massive amount of inheritance. She spent her days drowning herself with alcohol and was depressed all the time. She mourned her late husband with the companionship of her designer purses, designer jewelries, and money that could last her several lifetimes.\n\nBut only Fu Sinian knew the truth — that after his death, this woman hosted parties, lived in their mansion, drove expensive sport cars, traveled the world, and flirted with men. She was having the time of her life.\n\nFu Sinian wasn’t so angry that his soul dissipated; quite the contrary, he was so angry that he had come back to life!\n\nFu Sinian, who had come back to life, looked at the mourning Yu Duo and smiled devilishly. \n\n“We are on! Watch me make you fall in love with me for real this time!”>"
