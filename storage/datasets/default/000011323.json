	"description": "Shang Weiyu, who detests Mary Sue stories, one day got bound to an Anti-Mary Sue system by the heavens. Her mission is to transmigrate into Mary Sue stories and weaken the brainless Mary Sue halo. \n\nAren’t they just Mary Sues? Knowing the plot of the story, this father rolls up my sleeves and goes to work, bashing one with each hand without any trace of fear.\n\nBut these Mary Sues one by one continue to break character. It would be fine if they just didn't follow the plot, but what's with all these Mary Sues falling in love with me??\n\nOverbearing superior: Even though you only taste like this, remember to come to my office later.\n\nShang Weiyu: Oh woman, I have zero interest in Mary Sues. I just want to go home right now, thank you.>"
