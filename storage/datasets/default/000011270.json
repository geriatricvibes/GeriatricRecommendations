	"description": "Framed up by his foes, Qin Sheng profited from misfortunes and inherited Pill Emperor Wanjie’s memories. Since then, he punched above his weight in the road of martial art cultivation and pill concocting. A random prescription written by him could attract a bunch of masters of pill concocting to clamor to be his disciples. His curing some female saints accidentally made the distinguished clan masters scramble for marrying their daughters to him. His unintentionally displaying the superb martial arts persuaded many a hand-masters to pledge loyalty to him. Qin Sheng rose like a star and ascended to the utmost height throughout heaven and earth!>"
