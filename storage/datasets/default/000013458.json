Luckily, everyone he has injured turned out to be merciless criminals! So, thanks to his intelligent looks coupled with his white hair and glasses, he began to be revered as ‘The White Enforcer’.\n\nYou can’t hear it, but today, just like every other day, he’s screaming inside, saying, “please don’t respect someone like me!!”>"
