	"description": "“He’s sick.”\n\nMom cried when she heard the doctor’s words.\n\nI didn’t understand why she was crying.\n\nIn order to keep her from crying, I pretended to be normal and recovered from my illness.\n\nI became friends with my classmates, and when we went to karaoke, they disappeared, leaving me and girl behind.\n\nI saw the girl being made fun of in the classroom, and for the first time, I took an interest in people. I tried to get involved with the girl myself.\n\nMy childhood friend, who had been making fun of me behind my back, stopped me.\n\n“Hey, don’t turn into what you used to be!”\n\n“—-I’m a convenient childhood friend who pays the bills. You said you didn’t like me because I was annoying. Then stay the hell away from me.”\n\nA coming-of-age love story about a sober girl who’s a hidden novelist, and a guy who loves nothing more than drawing pictures, both of whom are trying to become manga artists!>"
