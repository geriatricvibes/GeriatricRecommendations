	"description": "Lin Xiao Ci transmigrated as the female villain in a novel in ancient times. \n\nIn order to get close to the male lead, her character has walked the path of seeking death. She decided to stay away from the male lead and his family and cherish her life. \n\nSo she quickly prepared the divorce papers and delivered them to the male lead who had been set up by the original villain to marry her. \n\n“Husband, I would like to turn over a new leaf. In the past, I have used you and I have wronged you. Now, I will return your freedom to you” \n\nBut the man, instead of being joyful, tore the divorce papers into pieces and fiercely said, “Dream on!”>"
