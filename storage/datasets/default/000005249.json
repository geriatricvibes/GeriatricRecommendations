	"description": "The Cloud Continent, respected for martial arts, the great world descends and the geniuses gather.\r\n\r\nThis era is a stage for the wicked.\r\n\r\nHan Yu, who is a demon from the sky that swallows the body, rose after three years of silence, and since then he embarked on the path to hegemony by trampling and killing all kinds of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nIn front of Han Yu, nobody dared to call him against the sky, because the world can be swallowed, much less against the sky.>"
