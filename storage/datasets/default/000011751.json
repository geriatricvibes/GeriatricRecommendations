	"description": "Is there anything scarier than being born as a traitor's sister?\n\nEuphil Raize, my half-brother from a different mother will start a rebellion and kill the royal family, including me. \nThat is why I will try my hardest to survive into adulthood and leave the palace safely before my brother started his rebellion. \n\n'Mirthy, don't worry I will protect you.'\n\nEuphil held my 7 year old hand gently, his blonde hair twinkling against the sun rays. His handsome face was smiling at me warmly. \n\nI don't need any protection from you is what I wanted to say but I couldn't say it to him, could I?!\n\nPerhaps, have I happened to tame my brother too well?>"
