	"description": "Issac, who has memories of his previous life in Japan, is an apprentice gardener of a duke’s family.\n\nThe duke’s house was the house of a rival daughter of an otome game played by his younger sister!\n\nBut I realized that I’m not a mob in the game.\n\nThere is no possibility of being caught up with the rival and facing ruin.\n\nDoes it make sense for me to have memories of my previous life?\n\nThat’s why I aimed to become a gardener without worrying about being in the world of an otome game.>"
