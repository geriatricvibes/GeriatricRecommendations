	"description": "My name is Joo In-gong.    The name that my parents gave me meant ‘protagonist’ of the world. Really?\n\nAs anyone can predict, I was constantly teased due to my name. In kindergarten, elementary school, middle school and high school. If I went to university as planned then I would probably be laughed at there as well.\n\nSo, at one point, I really hated my name.\n\nBut not anymore. Now, I think slightly differently. Maybe being named Joo In-gong was a type of foreshadowing?>"
