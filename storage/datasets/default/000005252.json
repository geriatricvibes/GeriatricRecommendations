	"description": "Diana is an illegitimate child who is said to be the only stain on the entirely honourable Archduke Teravita.\r\n\r\n“Don't even get close to this kind of thing again. This is not the place for a thousand different things like you.”\r\n\r\nAfter ten years of waiting for the day to leave, bearing her mother's abuse and the princess's hatred, the Duke returned.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t look like your mother at all.”\r\n\r\nThe Archduke somehow thought of his dead wife whenever he saw Diana, but in the end he turned away from her.\r\n\r\n ***\r\n\r\nWhen I made the decision to give up everything and escape from illegitimate bond that can never be broken,\r\n\r\n“You are mine…”\r\n\r\nThe hidden truth was revealed, and everything about the relentless Grand Duke collapsed.>"
