	"description": "When Meng Chu woke up, everyone said that she madly loves Chen Shuguan. Only she knew that this person was the culprit who paralyzed her for half of her life in the future.\n\nChen Shuguan held an injection: “Meng Chu, come over here. I heard that you were telling people that you don’t love me anymore.”\n\nMeng Chu clutched her naked chest, shrank in the corner of the bed, and shivered: “No, no. I love you to death.”\n\nChen Shuguan’s eyes flashed under his glasses: “You said you want to die.”\n\nMeng Chu: “…”\n\nChen Shuguan wanted to kill Meng Chu at first sight. Whether it was by placing her in a formalin container in the laboratory or drying her after sterilization. But later on, he discovered that what he really wanted the most was to f*ck her to death.>"
