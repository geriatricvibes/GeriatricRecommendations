	"description": "After being fired, Lu Qingjiu finally decided to return to his hometown to farm.\n\nAt first, he started raising a pig, and then he found that the pig could solve more high-level math questions than he could.\n\nAfter that, he started raising a flock of chickens, and then he found that his own fighting ability was one-tenth of that of a single chicken.\n\nFinally, Lu Qingjiu finally realised that this old home wasn’t quite right… Especially a certain person by his side who constantly stared at him day in and day out.\n\nLu Qingjiu: “Are you drooling because of the spicy stir-fry I’m holding or because of me?”\n\nBai Yuehu pointed at the stir-fry.\n\nLu Qingjiu: “Then can you let go??”\n\nBai Yuehu reluctantly glanced at Lu Qingjiu’s arm, before loosening his teeth.>"
