Also, from that day on, the only goal of Lin Xiaomi was to dislodge him!\n\nThe first person that Leng Yihuang saw after losing memory was Lin Xiaomi, who was a full-breasted beauty simple like an innocent child. She fascinated Leng Yihuang like a magnet. Since the day they met, his only thought was to fuck her!\n\nOf course, the winner is king, the loser needed to warm the bed… But after the night, the bastard just disappeared. Lin Xiaomi swore to God that she would hunt down that asshole no matter where he was.\n\nBut when a bunch of guards with guns showed up and called Lin Xiaomi “Your Ladyship”, she was struck dumb with fear and astonishment. The man who walked out of a Rolls-Royce was just Leng Yihuang, who turned out to be the heir of a big shot…>"
