	"description": "Partisan disputes in the empire made the ever-neutral Shen family a victim of internal conflict. They were accused of unwarranted crimes. Overnight, families that had been well-connected with each other had drawn their boundaries.\n\nThe Shen family was ransacked, and only the two remaining children were thrown into prison and became inmates.\n\nShen Moyan at that time had two wishes.\n\nOne is to protect his sister, and the other is to find evidence that can prove the family’s innocence.\n\nAfter losing the remaining family member, the second wish does not seem to be so important.\n\nWhat about proven innocence?\n\nHe wanted the entire empire to be buried with them.\n\n[So, do you want to become stronger ? ]>"
