	"description": "Durarara!! spin-off series that takes place after the original, starring Orihara Izaya as the main character.\n\nAn informant appeared in the suburban city. He simply cruises for information, doing nothing but giving people a push on the back.\n\n[Geez, human observation (rehabilitation) can really be a pain]\nHe is an informant. This is not to exaggerate – he is but one man. Setting aside the fact of whether or not you should truely call being an informant an occupation, he certainly has the power to obtain a great deal of information.\n\nHe is by no means anything like a hero, nor can it be said that he is a villain.\n\nNor is he nothing.\n\nHe is only true.\n\nHe is eternally obedient only to his own desire’s.\n\n[Humans]\nHe is determined to continue loving the good and the bad of the masses that are included in this world.\n\nHe simply just loves humans.\n\nBecause even if the result of his love causes his humans to become broken, the informant can still love these broken humans equally.>"
