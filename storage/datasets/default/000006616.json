	"description": "Being born as an omega in a prestigious count’s family is considered a disgrace. Desperate to keep his secret, Masazumi lives as a Beta in boarding school. “I won’t fall in love with anyone, I’ll die without a pair!”. However, one day his unrivaled good looks and wit caught the eyes of his classmates and he was attacked!! The one who rescued him from this predicament was the janitor, Miyake. Despite being dressed in plain work clothes and a hat, when Miyake approached, Masazumi felt a spark like he’d never experienced before. >"
