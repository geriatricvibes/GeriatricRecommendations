	"description": "I possessed a R-19 BL novel.\n\nI was the wife of an obsessive maniac.\n\nDaphne was a character who was killed by the main character while bullying the main character lover.\n\nTo escape from this death route, I thought I should disappear quietly without intervening between the two of them.\n\nI can get divorced, take alimony, live a new life, and live as I want.\n\nLooking at the eyes of the two main characters, I only looked for a chance to leave.\n\nI finally declared Cesare a divorce.\n\n“We’re getting divorced.”\n\nBut this obsession reaction is weird.\n\n“Did you have an affair with him?”\n\nWho?\n\n“Gabriel, the s*ave I brought.”\n\n… I didn’t cheat…?\n\n“I’ll be your new home.”\n\nWhy are you saying something that could be misunderstood? Weren’t you all gay?\n\nWhy are you doing this to me!>"
