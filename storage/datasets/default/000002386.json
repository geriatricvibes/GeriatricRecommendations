	"description": "Han Shaoling is a mogul known to all, but thanks to his grandfather’s death and his will, he has no choice but to marry a man to be his wife. Xu Moyu, in order to save the lives of his brothers in the gang, has to marry arrogant and cold-blooded Han Shaoling.\n\nHan Shaolin sneers and forcibly presses Xu Moyu, “I didn’t marry you for nothing. Shouldn’t you carry out your duty to please me as my wife now?” What he says is utterly impersonal and aggressive. However, indifferent and supercilious Xu Moyu just narrows his slanted eyes in anger. In the next second, a cold pistol has been pointed at Han Shaolin’s forehead. “You seem to have nothing better to do so you’d like to be shot, Hierarch Han!”\n\nThe heartless younger top VS the expressionless cunning bottom. Let’s see how they break through this relationship.>"
