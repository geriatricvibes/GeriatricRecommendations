	"description": "In his previous life, Mo Junlan was an invalid who could not cultivate. He was killed by someone when he was 18 years old, and then he was reborn in the Immortal Kingdom, obtaining the opportunity to go against the heavens. But when he was ascending to the Divine Realm, he died under the thunder tribulation.\n\n Mo Junlan, who had died once again, was reborn back to the Spirit Profound Continent where he had been in his previous life. Fortunately, his life sword was reborn along with him. \n\nAfter being reborn, Mo Junlan suddenly found that he seemed to lack everything. \n\nMo Junlan (distressed): What should I do if I lack Spirits Stones? \n\nLing Xiao (serious): I’ll try to earn Spirit Stones. \n\nMo Junlan (frowning): What should I do if I lack World Treasures? \n\nLing Xiao (indifference): I can go and rob. \n\nMo Junlan (pretending to be gloomy): I… still lack a wife? \n\nLing Xiao (shy): Junlan Gege, I can also be your wife ~>"
