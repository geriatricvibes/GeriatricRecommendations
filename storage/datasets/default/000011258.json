	"description": "I ended my life with my own hands with no place to lean on. I thought I’d finally get some relief, but then I woke up in a strange place? \n\n“You’re Rosiane. You are the pride of Esteria, my beloved daughter and the only princess of the empire.” \n\nIn the series of the novel “The Prince”, she possessed Rosiane de Esteria, who died at the age of five.\n\nBut… the men in this house, why are they so affectionate towards me?\n\n“Rosiane, good girl. Are you going to call me father?”\n\n“….”\n\n“Rosiane! I’m Eryte!”\n\n“Rosiane, you haven’t forgotten your brother’s name, have you? It’s Bernique.”\n\n“Sister, I’m Leav. Do you remember my name?”\n\nI took the place of Rosiane, and the situation of being loved beyond my means only makes me feel guilty. Can a mere person like me accept such love?>"
