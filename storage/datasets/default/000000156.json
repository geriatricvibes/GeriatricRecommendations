Under the lake was an old, white-haired fighter who loved eating meat. The old servant, missing his front teeth, carried a sword sheath on his back. In the mountains, was a young granduncle riding on a green cow; he did not dare go down the mountains. There was a cold female killer, riding on a panda. In Jianghu, higher-ups who set out on a journey had to pay attention to their outstanding outfits. Female heroes who walked along Jianghu had to pay attention to their popularity.
