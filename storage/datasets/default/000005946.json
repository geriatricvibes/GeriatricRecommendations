	"description": "When Lu Miao was eight years old, she came to the hospital with her parents.\r\n\r\nHer father’s car hit someone, and the boy lost his leg.\r\n\r\nThe adults told her: “You will have an older brother in the future.”\r\n\r\nThe elder brother who grew up with Lu Miao was named Jiang Haoyue.\r\n\r\nHaoyue, the most beautiful big moon, has a bright and clear light and infinite light.\r\n\r\nLu Miao always felt that this metaphor for Jiang Haoyue was very appropriate.>"
