	"description": "The God Community Kitchen “Vahalla Kitchen” is always busy during dinner hour. My name is Sei, as a pig that has the ability to talk, I was ordered by Odin to help out as a “MEAL” !\n\nI know that I have the mystery ability to revive once per day but isn’t it horrible for me to be a meal everyday? The reason why I'm still staying here is because of the goddess Brynhildr who is not that bad. \nEe… why is the number 2 of the god community, Loki, here? \nThe god community is in trouble and want my help? \nBut I’m just a boar~~>"
