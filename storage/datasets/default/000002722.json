You don’t have to protect me.’\n\nAnyway, according to his brother’s wishes, he was going to take a break now, but strange forces are targeting him…\n\nSomewhere familiar a man is kneels in front of him.…\n\n“I can quit being the guild leader, then can I follow you?”\n\n“You don’t have to stop being the guild leader, and I’ll tell you about it if you visit me from time to time.”\n\nContract\n\nTo sign a contract without even reading the contract that protects me in exchange for just telling a story… He was a person who seemed likely to be deceived wherever he went.\n\n“Come closer. So that, I can protect you. It’s hard if you stay away”>"
