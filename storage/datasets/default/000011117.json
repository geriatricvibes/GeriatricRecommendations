	"description": "A curse was cast on a girl called Takamura and on her 17th birthday she will turn into a boy. The only way to remove the curse, was to kiss her ouji-sama (lol). While thinking it's absurd and an inconvenience to kiss the ouji but I don't want to become a guy, I lived a somewhat peaceful school life. But for some reason, the most popular guy in school - Sunohara Chiharu started to consult me about love matters. Even though I don't have the time to support other people's love, well, it's okay as long as it doesn't become troublesome. But when I went at it with such light feelings, I got more and more embroiled.\n\nIt seems that Takamura-kun <i>really</i> is cursed.>"
