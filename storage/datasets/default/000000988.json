	"description": "If she could start over again, she definitely wouldn't treat that person as the only salvation in her life—thought Tang Yu as she lied in the cold and dark basement.\r\n\r\nWhen Tang Yu opened her eyes again, she saw her long-deceased parents and herself returning to her childhood. \r\n\r\nThis time, Tang Yu no longer wished to have any more contact with that person. She only wished for her parents to live. But...why is that person so persistently clinging to her?!\r\n\r\n'Let's go to school together!'\r\n\r\nTang Yu: No, go away.\r\n\r\n'I heard from my mom that once you get married to someone, you can be with that person forever. Let's get married!'\r\n\r\nTang Yu: No, go away.\r\n\r\n 'Tang-Tang, your voice is so nice. Can you speak some more?'\r\n\r\nTang Yu: Get los—mmhm?! You scoundrel!>"
