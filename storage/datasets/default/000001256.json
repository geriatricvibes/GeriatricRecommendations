	"description": "I didn't expect to be reincarnated into the warring states period, but I could never have guessed that I would be reincarnated as Sanboshi! Isn't he the guy who will be used as a pawn in the Kiyosu Conference by Hideyoshi? The guy died at the age of 26! No way! Although my life might be on hard mode, with me taking over the reins of the Oda clan at age three, I won't resign myself to becoming a puppet. I will unite the Oda family and unify the country!>"
