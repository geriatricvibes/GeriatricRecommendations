	"description": "  Shu Nian who grew up in the orphanage dreamed of becoming a princess since childhood so that a prince will come to rescue him. In the end, the one who came was not a prince but a cranky 「master」 Xie Yan...\r\n  \r\n  Xie Yan believed that he didn't like men and unable to tolerate the advancement of the man beside him. Hence he tried to send Shu Nian away from his sight. However, unbeknownst to him that by sending him away, he also sent away the 「stabilizer」 to his temperament...\r\n\r\nOne wants to love him while one doesn't want his love.  「Love」 between these two men, will they be able to achieve a common ground one day? It's not like he never held men before but there are only two words to illustrate this feeling -- very stiff. There's nothing good about it!\r\n\r\nIt feels completely different when holding girls, girls are soft. Xiao Nian is very flexable, very lithe with a slim yet strong waist...\r\n\r\nQuickly shaking his head to remove the vague idea of 「Xiao Nian seems to be better than girls」 to the outer space. Xie Yan turned pale and went back to the living room.>"
