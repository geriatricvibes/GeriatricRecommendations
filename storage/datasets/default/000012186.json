	"description": "This script was originally supposed to be about a Scum Gong x Cheap Shou — the Scum Gong abuses the Cheap Shou, the Cheap Shou became hopelessly apathetic, the Scum Gong became a Cheap Gong, and the Cheap Shou abuses the Cheap Gong.\r\n\r\nThat should have been the case!!!!!\r\n\r\nBut the script began to unfold—-\r\n\r\nThe Scum Gong was reborn to the past, and encountered the Cheap Shou who also got reborn.\r\n\r\nThe Scum Gong was horrified to discover that the Cheap Shou had changed his job and became a beast-like, ruthless, blackened Gong, ahhhhh help!\r\n\r\nThe fucking miserable Scum Gong was taken and defiled, then defiled and taken, then after being taken from the front he was taken from the back, and finally he was taken into a loyal dog, sensual, tsundere Shou!>"
