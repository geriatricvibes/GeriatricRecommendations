	"description": "Shen Yansheng always thought that she didn't like Lu Jingce until one day she heard that a certain group boss intended to marry his daughter to Lu Jingce. She was so angry that she couldn't eat anything that night and locked herself in the room after returning home. When Lu Jingce came back in the evening, he took the key from the study, opened the door and entered her bedroom. He sat beside the bed, leaned over and kissed her to wake her from her sleep. She looked at him angrily, but he smiled happily and asked, 'Jealous?'\r\n\r\nShen Yansheng and Lu Jingce have been falling in love all the time, mainly because she hadn't figured out how to explain their relationship to her parents, which caused her parents to always think she was single, so they took the initiative to trick her into going on a blind date. But someone happened to have a dinner in that restaurant that day, and saw her and her blind date sitting at a table for dinner from a distance. She felt a gaze looking at her from behind, and when she turned her head, she met someone's handsome face that was half-smiling. That night, as soon as Shen Yansheng came home, she threw herself on someone, raised her hand and swore, 'I can explain it!' Someone still had that half-smile and pinched her cheek, 'The explanation is invalid.'>"
