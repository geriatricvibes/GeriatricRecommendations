	"description": "The wolf king lost his leadership of the pack in a battle against another wolf and was brought into a zoo for treatment.\r\n\r\nAnimal breeder:\r\n\r\nBreeder A: 'Since the wolf king left the wolf pack, it did not drink water and refused treatment. If it goes on like this it would reach a dead end. Should we send it back to the wolves?'\r\n\r\nBreeder B: 'It has severely torn muscles in its abdomen and back, and its hind legs almost got bitten off. How can it recover faster if it is returned to the wolves?\r\n\r\nBreeder C: 'I think this wolf king mainly has a psychological issue. Should we find it a companion?'\r\n\r\nBreeder D: 'I think it's a great idea. The female wolves are too cruel. Give it a try with a dog first.'\r\n\r\nLittle dog was forced into the wolf's den, “OMG, a real wolf, it's going to kill me!”>"
