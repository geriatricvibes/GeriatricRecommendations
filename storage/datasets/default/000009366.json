But the biggest crisis staring down upon him is the open beta scheduled for a year later, and the coming of the players. \r\n\r\nHow can he, as a vampire, get strong enough to fight against the oncoming catastrophe incarnates – the players themselves!! \r\n\r\nThis is the tale of a Progenitor Vampire leading a group of vampires and humans farming the land. \r\n\r\n>"
