	"description": "The novel Chronicles of the Hero of Frosimar is a story about the failures of the protagonist not the successes.\n\n“It’s not good.”\n\nThe First Emperor, who conquered the whole world, closed his eyes with a brief appreciation (after reading the novel).\n\nBut the moment he opened his eyes again, there were only a few lines about him in the Chronicles of the Hero of Frosimar.\n\nThis was because he became an imprisoned prince who met death with his first appearance (in the novel).>"
