	"description": "Shao Xian went back in time to when he was ten years old and met his pitiful old enemy. He wanted to personally train him so that when the other grew up, he wouldn’t turn against him.\n\n \n\nBut he didn’t expect that this old enemy would turn sweet and sticky after being taken care of.\n\n \n\nIt was just that this little sweet cake was too insecure and often, golden beads of tears would drip.\n\n \n\nAs soon as he cried, Shao Xian was helpless, and of course, he would want to give him everything.\n\n \n\n—\n\n \n\nOn the way to an auction, Shao Xian died in a car accident.\n\n \n\nBefore he died, he thought, Fu Baizhou must be very pleased without him being present to mix things up.\n\n \n\nAfter all, in Yan City, Fu Baizhou shocked everyone with a name of being cruel and ruthless.\n\n \n\nOnly one person dared to confront him.\n\n \n\nWhen he opened his eyes again, he was wearing a custom suit, reexperiencing his tenth birthday.\n\n \n\nHe saw a dirty little boy being ridden on like a horse. He suddenly remembered the rumors that had been circulating widely in his previous life. It was about the tragic childhood of a ruthless man surnamed Fu.>"
