	"description": "White like the snow and rosy like a flower.\r\nShe was so lovely, but how could this have happened to her?\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter how lovely she looks on the outside.\r\nWhen one has a glimpse of what is inside, they will see all the dirty, lustful thoughts.\r\n\r\nEunSeo, the youngest daughter of Lord Yoon YeoPyung, has been abandoned by her husband and has returned. She has come to recuperate at the family’s country home. Within half a month, the elderly housekeeper has hurt her hip, causing her to leave.\r\nAnd for the next ten days…\r\nShe must live in this secluded house with the robust young man, MuGyeom. Just the two of them.>"
