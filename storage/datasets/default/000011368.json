	"description": "With a congenital defect from birth, Xia Nuo took part in an escape game to prolong his life.\n\nIn the first game world, his identity was a blind, rich young man. The system told him: “At the beginning of the game, remember to stay close to your ‘boyfriend,’ he’s going to save you three times. This is a benefit that I’m giving for a novice like you, okay?”\n\nXia Nuo: Okay, I will remember.\n\nSystem: The new guy looks like he’s obedient. I feel at ease.\n\nAt the start of the game, Xia Nuo immediately grabbed the man who the system told him about.\n\nSystem: …!!!\n\nThe man looked at the little lamb who had thrown himself at him, and smiled slowly.\n\nWhen the game ended, Xia Nuo sighed and lamented: It was an easy game, there wasn’t even danger that came my way! My ‘boyfriend’ even took great care of me, I should thank him the next time we meet.\n\nSystem: I relaxed a little too early!>"
