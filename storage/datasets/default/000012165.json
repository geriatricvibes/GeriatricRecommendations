	"description": "It is said that a sage once took water from the Yellow Spring, soil from the Netherworld, and fire from Purgatory, and made a bowl in which he sealed the souls of the divine beast and called it the bowl of seven emotions. Afterward, the bowl of seven emotions entered into the mortal world and tossed and turned in there until it fell into Tang Susu’s hands. \n\nThe divine beast sat in the bowl and ordered, “Every day, you must give three burns of incense to this divine beast, and it must be ambergris.” Tang Susu calmly poured in half a bowl of chicken-flavored cat food. \n\nThe divine beast was furious. “I’m a very, very fierce peerless beast and I eat dragons!' \n\nTang Susu poured another half bowl of cat food.\n\nThe divine beast raised his chin. “And two small yellow croakers.”>"
