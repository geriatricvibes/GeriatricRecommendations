	"description": "In the bloody medieval war novel, I possessed an extra.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was the wife of a traitor who died in the beginning.\r\n\r\nI abandoned my husband to live and tried to run away, but was captured by the most vicious man in the original story.\r\n\r\nI disguised myself as a maid and only sought opportunities to escape from time to time, but the villains began to like me.\r\n\r\nKnowing the original story, I thought I was the strongest here, but seeing people’s terrible future was disturbing.\r\n\r\nWhy were so many good people gathered around the villain?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the villains have to be villains!\r\n\r\nWhatever, I don’t know anymore. Still,  I couldn’t just let him die.\r\n\r\nThat man needs to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIf I want to live, I shouldn’t go there.\r\n\r\nI’ll cut the rotten branches.\r\n\r\nThis was how I cleared the obstacle one by one.\r\n\r\nThe original story is starting to change little by little.>"
