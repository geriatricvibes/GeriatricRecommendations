	"description": "On a certain morning a metabolic 35 year old salary man was suddenly transported to another world.\n\nWithout knowledge, without the ability to communicate, and I am especially not confident about my physical capabilities. I have no idea what to do.\n\nHowever my current goal is to figure out how to keep living using the skills granted to me from the existence known as the interface.\n\nHero? Demon King? I know nothing about that. I am just a salaryman.>"
