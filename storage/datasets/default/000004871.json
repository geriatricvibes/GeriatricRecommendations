I accidentally became Male Lead first love!\r\n\r\n‘Where does this pleasant scent come from?’\r\n\r\nIrene turns her head to follow the scent, like a bee searching for flowers.\r\n\r\nThere were strong muscles, wide shoulders, scars across the back, blonde hair shining like gold... Oh man!\r\n\r\n‘Is it a dream? No. Oh my God, did I something happen?\r\n<p style='text-align: center'>***</p>\r\nJade, the Second Male Lead of the original novel [Became Their Flower].\r\n\r\nThe Prince's capable aid and a sweet flower smile only to Female Lead are attractive.\r\n\r\nSeo-young became a fan of him by accident. But was it called lucky (Fans never get lucky)\r\n\r\nIrene is an extra who doesn't have a single line in the original. Still, the fanaticism beyond time and space continues.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nOh wait! Something's not right I was a fan of the Second Male Lead, but why Male Lead followed me?\r\n\r\nNo way... One plus one?>"
