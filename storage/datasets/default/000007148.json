	"description": "To be is to have a soul. The soul begets a will. Wills accumulate into mysterious psychic forces, weaving secret domains within the fabric of reality.\n\nLi Yiming, a gentle and kind-hearted person, was embroiled in this secret facade of reality against his will. Was it a coincidence, or was it preordained by fate?
