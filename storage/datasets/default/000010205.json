	"description": "The term “unrequited love” refers to a very fragile situation in which both parties are unaware of each other’s feelings, causing all sorts of misunderstandings.\n\nKuzuhara Kuzuo is a second-year high schooler. A genius born into an extremely poor family. He plays the role of an unintelligent student because “A knife that is too sharp can unintentionally hurt those around it.”\n\nShirayuki Tohka is also a second-year high schooler. She’s a mediocre student born into one of the most influential families in Japan. If she didn’t live up to the high expectations of the people around her, she wouldn’t be recognized by her family, so she played the role of a genius.\n\nThe two childhood friends, opposites in nature, were separated when they graduated elementary school, eventually reuniting in high school.\n\nAt first, it was awkward, but… Studying together in the student council room, going out on holidays, catching a cold and caring for one another—they get drawn to each other by the parts they lack, and their feelings slowly develop.\n\nThis is a “coming-of-age romcom” about two people who pretend to be something they’re not, but gradually take off their masks and start to develop feelings for each other.>"
