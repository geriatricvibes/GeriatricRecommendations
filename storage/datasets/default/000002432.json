	"description": "Qinghe County master Gu Sheng died. She had a first class beauty, her name could move the world, but she still lost to the hands of a woman inferior to her. Gu Sheng was only able to understand that she was the antagonist of the heroine after her death- a cannon fodder.\n\nIn a pure white space, Gu Sheng was expressionless after her death.\n\nSystem: “The heroine must change her fate, must fight against cannon fodder and the passerby to brush a sense of existence. As the master, you are their biggest stone in the way.”\n\nGu Sheng’s eyes flashed and made a peerless smile, “Then let me see who is the stumbling block that should be trampled and who is the final winner!”>"
