	"description": "High school student Kanda Shun had always been incapable of imagining. Until one day, when he wished Princess Rosalie, resident heroine of the popular RPG game ‘Dragon Bless’ out into the real world! Havoc occurs as Princess Rosalie pries opened drawers, breaks vases and pots, and swings a life-sized, ruby encrusted sword around at the first sign of danger.\n\nFurthermore, Rosalie declares, out of the blue, that Shun be her husband, and she would stop at nothing to bring him happiness. On top of that, Shun would have to deal with Nadeshiko, ruler and tyrant of his high school, as well as the over-affectionate and doting cousin, Mikoto!\n\nHow in the world is a guy supposed to handle all of that?!>"
