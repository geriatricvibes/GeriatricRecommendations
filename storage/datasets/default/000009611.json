	"description": "Biased parents, framed by her best friend, in desperation, Ye Fanxing married Mr. Fu, who sat in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nHe would teach her how to play the piano, give her flowers, and pamper her into being the happiest person in the world.\r\n\r\nOne day, at a class reunion, people ridiculed her for having a handicapped husband. And her said crippled husband showed up with grace and elegance, leaving all the people who laughed at her dumbstruck and unable to speak.\r\n\r\nIn the darkest time of her life, he pulled her to actively face the sun, thereby making her experience a brilliant life.\r\n\r\nIt’s really nice to meet you, my Mr. Fu.>"
