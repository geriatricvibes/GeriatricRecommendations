Not only do I look like her, I can imitate her every move.\r\n\r\nBut that spiteful Prince Sylvan, the princess's older brother, always sees through my disguise on the first try and says 'Do you think you've become my beloved sister?'\r\n\r\nYes, the prince is a serious siscon.\r\n\r\n“Sigh, you are as naive as ever. Do you mean to impersonate my sister?”>"
