	"description": "Right after transmigrating into a parallel world, Yang Yi was a bit stupefied upon seeing a adorable little girl calling him father. Fine, Xixi is 100% my daughter, but my child’s mother is actually an aloof, absolute beauty who’s a famous singer.\n\n\nHow do I coax my baby? Yang Yi, who was a assassin in his previous life, scratched his head. How about I tell some stories? Yang Yi didn’t think that the stories he imported from his previous world would be famous world-wide! How do I bring back my child’s mother who left in anger? The experienced Yang Yi indicated that there was no problem a love song couldn’t fix. And if it couldn’t, then two songs!>"
