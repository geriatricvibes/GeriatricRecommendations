Isn’t this much gentler?”\n\n“Ah, Your Majesty.”\n\n“I’m a husband who will let my wife have everything she desires.”\n\nCaught up in her ‘sweet’ husband’s cruel plans for revenge, Hazel faced her last chance to undo everything, however…\n\n“I found it.”\n\nThe emperor’s blue eyes shone only on her.>"
