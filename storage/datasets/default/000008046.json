	"description": "In the current era, people are either normal or are with ‘special abilities’. Cases related to the latter are managed by the “National Anomaly Prevention and Control and Special Species Management Office”.\n\nQi Zheng Emperor Sheng Lingyuan was reawakened a thousand years later after he jumped off the fiery Red Lake. \n\nXuan Ji, a newly transferred staff to the Reparations Division of the Deviant Control Office, finds himself having to clean up the mess of a revived tyrannical monarch. \n\nThe two seemed to share something from the past, but unbeknownst to them, a big conspiracy is stirring right underneath their noses that could destroy the balance of the world.>"
