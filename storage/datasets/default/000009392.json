	"description": "When Ye Qing Ran wakes up, she finds that she has transmigrated into a book. She has become the vain, domineering, and evil villain who dies a tragic death. \n\nBefore she transmigrated into the book, she was the carefully groomed heir of the family. Her life goal was to make the family stand at the apex of the world of fame and fortune. \n\nAfter she transmigrated into the book, she does not want to participate in wars in the business world anymore. Every day, she would hit on chicks, torture tr*sh, and flirt with handsome boys. \n\nBut why do her father and three brothers look at her more and more lovingly? \n\nFather: “Whoever dares to say that I favor boys over girls, I’ll make his family bankrupt.” \n\nBig Brother: “My sister is the smartest and most suitable to be the heir.” \n\nSecond Brother: “My sister is invincible and cool. She is my idol.” \n\nThird Brother: “My sister is an angel. Our whole family is honored because of her.”>"
