	"description": "There were rumors of a place where the rains never ceased. Half of the month was a deafening, torrential downpour, and the other half a drizzle, at best slightly overcast. The sky was clear at most once or twice a month.\r\n\r\nHow could people actually live in a place where it rained constantly? Was it some sort of divine protection, or simply the raw power of the human mind? Driven by a burning curiosity, I departed on a journey to the mountainous region known as The Rainlands.\r\n\r\nWhat I would discover was nothing like what I expected–a culture at times oddly familiar and yet disturbingly foreign.\r\n>"
