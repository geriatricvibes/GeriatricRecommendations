	"description": "It all started after he picked up a black eye mask in the school’s sports field.\n\nWithin a campus completely enshrouded in thick fog, one’s appearance was hard to discern.\n\nOn top of the classroom podium lay a piece of sharpened chalk. Upon the blackboard, a message was scrawled in white.\n\n“May all students enter the classroom with your admission ticket ten minutes before the exam starts. The exam instructors will inform you of the rules. Please follow them and refrain from cheating. The exam will start at midnight sharp. Those not at the testing site at that time are considered to have abstained.”\n\nGeng Cong: “If one egg tart and one bag of dried blueberries are dropped at the same time on the tenth floor, which will hit the ground first?”\n\nJiang Shi’s jaw dropped.\n\nGeng Cong: “Should we calculate air resistance?”\n\nJiang Shi: “Nope. If I eat both of them, they won’t have a chance to hit the ground.”>"
