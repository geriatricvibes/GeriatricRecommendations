	"description": "I dreamed of becoming a successful designer.\n\nBut, I failed.\n\n‘If I ever go back in time, I would take back everything that belongs to me.’\n\nIt was the lament of someone who missed his chance 3 times.\n\nBut I was serious in my own way.\n\n‘If only I could start over just like in a webnovel.’\n\nIt had already been too late.\n\nModern fantasy is still one’s imagination.\n\nThe moment I thought about it, my life became a modern fantasy.>"
