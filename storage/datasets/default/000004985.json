	"description": "I thought the world was vast, for me to wander, but now, it has only become a cage. For a life unhindered, I wield a single sword to pierce the ninth heavens. People find me displeasing, but there's nothing they can do. That's the kind of life I love!\n\n'Stop! I paved this path and I planted these trees. If you want to pass through...'\n\n'Brother, I come from the Dustfallen sect.'\n\n'What? The Dustfallen sect! Piss off!'\n\nThis pitiful sect was so poor to the point where even bandits did not want to waste time on it. However, how could this sect, these nine measly people, be ordinary? What you see is only what they wish for you to see. What you can't see is the truth!\n\nMu Yu—a young human boy with the powers of elemental demons—accidentally joins the impoverished Dustfallen sect. The sect that even bandits did not want to waste time on was actually hid great talents, concealing a huge secret! You look down on my sect? Then that's your ignorance!>"
