	"description": "Ye Che died, and then revived. 【True Guide+Champion Body+Bloodline+Profound Essence】\n\nHe’s a bit clueless, but in fact, he’s arrived 700 years after the day of the S7 quarter finals. Quietly, as though abandoned by that century.\n\nBut luckily, Earth 700 years later actually still has League of Legends.\n\nWhen one day playing League of Legends becomes linked with survival, when ranking badges will manifest in reality and strengthen your body, when the path of evolution of all of humanity is unlocked because of League of Legends, when everybody is painfully struggling and suffering for victory, Ye Che, arrives in this year like a bug.>"
