	"description": "Out of boredom, Li Dong one day read through a whole list of books about scumbags male leads and their abusive possession of the submissive male protagonists.\n\nHis thoughts: Damn it, all the protagonists are so lowly! I want to hit someone! How can this kind of book have a happy ending! Actually, every book has HE!\n\nWhy is the male lead always so easy, being practically disabled by his male partner yet still staying deeply in love with the scumbag who gave him away!\n\nLi Dong was so frustrated, but then, he suddenly transmigrated as the evil male partner in every book!\n\nMale lead: “Second Young Master, please have me, or the Young Master will be angry.”\n\nLi Dong: “You are really cheap.” But you shouldn’t be like this, you should respect yourself, understand?!>"
