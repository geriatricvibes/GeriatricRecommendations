	"description": "In the two years that he had been married to Liang Yesheng, Lu Ming had always lived in anger. Every time he quarreled with Liang Yesheng, Lu Ming would think, “Oh, my God, how could someone like him even find a spouse? What kind of idiot would marry this guy? Must be some really bad luck.” \n\nThen, he remembered that he seemed to be this idiot.\n\nFine, he’ll just get a divorce, and go back to being a free and normal person. Then, they can both live happily ever after, separately. If only this were the case.\n\nIn actuality, he decided to run back and continue being an idiot.>"
