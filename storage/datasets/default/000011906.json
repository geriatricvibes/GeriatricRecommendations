	"description": "The little orphan, whom she raised, was somehow the daughter of the villainous Duke.\n\nHe thought his daughter was dead and went crazy.\n\nOne day, when I was rolling with my feet because there was no way to deliver the news.\n\nThe Duke rushed into the house.\n\n“If you give up the child, I will kill you painlessly.”\n\n“Don’t kill Mom!”\n\nShe almost died after being mistaken as a kidnapper but was saved thanks to the child.\n\nNo matter if he was the father or whatnot, she cannot entrust the child to such a dangerous human being!\n\nThat’s how the shared lifestyle of raising a child with the villian began.….\n\nThis man, he is very different from what I thought.\n\n“I’ll give you my life, so please protect my daughter until the end.”\n\nI feel sorry for him.\n\n“Are you testing the limits of my patience?”\n\nHe was seductive.\n\n“For me, there was no woman before you, and there will be no woman after.”\n\nAnd also straightforward.\n\nWhat’s more, even the child considers me her mother…\n\nCan I get away from this dangerously attractive villian?>"
