	"description": "As a male fashion model, Su Nuo didn’t like others calling him feminine. But against all of his hopes, his beautiful appearance really betrayed him.\r\n\r\nThis was the saddest tragedy of all time!\r\n\r\nDear god, Su Nuo finally couldn’t stop himself from exploding, “I am actually very manly, ok!”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure? Come here, let me check whether you have abs or not.” The black bellied (black-hearted) director pushed him down on to a bed and took off his pajamas in high spirits.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later.\r\n\r\n“Your sister! Abs don’t form there!” The model Su struggled in tears.\r\n\r\nHow would he live through this day?.>"
