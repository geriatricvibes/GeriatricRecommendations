	"description": "— Science is the ultimate game changer —\r\n\r\nA super genius in the form of a young boy appears in modern day Japan.\r\n\r\nWith his help, cold fusion along with ultra-efficient batteries and motors become a reality, ending dependence on fossil fuels. As a result, Japan’s industries and its society itself goes through a monumental revolution. He goes on to help solve problems including the prediction and prevention of earthquakes and the cleanup of radiation from disasters like the Fukushima Nuclear Accident.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, thanks to the invention of the gravity engine, Japan takes to space and begins exploring other planets.\r\n\r\nHow will Earth’s expansion into the galaxy unfold?\r\n\r\nThis novel tells a tale which harkens back to the Golden Age of Science Fiction (1940s-50s) from a uniquely realistic point of view by leveraging modern day science.>"
