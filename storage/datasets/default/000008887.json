	"description": "If you’re a Filipino, and your lover cheated on you, what would you do? Will you end your life because of sadness? Hmph! Of course, not!\n\nEven more if you have a very beautiful, very kind, very caring, and super loving neighbor who always does cutesy acts to you.\n\nI am Bing, kneading dough is my work. The neighbor that I’m talking about is Kyra Yueseff, half Syrian-Pilya (Filipina but it can also mean naughty), and she loves eating my bread.\n\nShe’s eighteen.\n\nI’m thirty.\n\nAnd she said that she has a crush on me.>"
