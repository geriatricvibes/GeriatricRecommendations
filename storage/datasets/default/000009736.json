	"description": "Ha Joyoon, a war correspondent for TPA, a foreign news agency, has been in a coma for five years after being involved in an accident in a civil war zone. Miraculously, he returns home and visits his ex-lover, but he was already with someone else … They were friends from birth, and lovers after they grew up. A man who never thought of breaking up with his lover and did not imagine himself with another person in his life, found his lover with someone other than him. \n\nThe world blames all the consequences on his selfishness and irresponsibility. It took time and different ways to end, but Ha Joyoon, who never experienced such a thing, falls helplessly and clings to an old lover who is trying to forget him. But then another man came into his life. This new man doesn’t need affection and just wants to enjoy carnal desires. It is the first time that Ha Joyoon has experienced separation and the responsibility of love in his thirty-one years of life.>"
