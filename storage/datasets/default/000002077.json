	"description": "All of your love is my wings, giving me the strength to bypass storms. Touched smiles are our beliefs, we share our happiness and sorrow.\n\nThis year, 2015, marks the tenth year anniversary of my debut.\n\nTen years hold a special meaning in my heart, and so I wanted to do something to commemorate this special date. Throughout these ten years, the person I came to understand the most is myself. In the past few years, friends have suggested that I publish a book, yet I never got to it. What can I write about? Lazy, fickle, irritated. At the present day, after experiencing so much, I prefer the times where I had no schedule and had time to be alone. When you converse a lot with yourself, a lot of stories will pop up. These stories drew me in, and so I wanted to share them with you.\n\nAnd thus this book came to exist.>"
