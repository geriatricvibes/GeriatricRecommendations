	"description": "300 days have passed.\r\n\r\nWhen can I wake up?\r\n\r\nThe one that consoled me that I can own anything once I wake up cannot be seen anymore.\r\n\r\nThe one that said to take responsibility for me had disappeared, and no one looks for me anymore.\r\n\r\nYes. I was abandoned. Inside a collapsed building, relying on life-sustaining device to cling onto my life.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I feel that I would have died of loneliness if not for the world in my dreams.>"
