	"description": "The protagonist, Shiragami Jin, is dumped by his lover on Christmas Day, and while he’s walking through the city, he is called out to by a bunch of hooligans. Just as he’s about to flip out on them, a macho man in a Santa costume steps between them… What will he get from his unexpected encounter with Santa?\n\nIt’s a story about how the former yankee (but pure and a crybaby) Shiragami gets dumped at Christmas and finds happiness again.>"
