	"description": "He was publicly a town physician who used healing magic, but an assassin undercover. The young man, Shizuru, had lost most of his memories seven years ago and was transported into another world, who had through the help of a blind woman helped him, taken that path in life. Surrounded by beautiful women and girls with peculiar personalities for companions – a beautiful black wolf who understands human language, a liquor-soaked demolisher, a sniper with magic eyes, and a young lady with split personalities – the man would mutter even now: “I want to run away.”>"
