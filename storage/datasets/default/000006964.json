	"description": "Duchess Lydith Annemaria was 18 years old when her fiancé, the crown prince, broke off their engagement. Then her carriage was involved in an accident, and she found herself brought back in time to the age of 16 by a boy who claimed to be a god.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't want to change her personality to make the Crown Prince like her. It would be foolish to repeat the same thing over and over again, so, it might be better to reign at the top of the demon tribe and rule over all the human nations.\r\n\r\nLydith makes up her mind. She will make the king of the demon tribe fall in love with her beauty!>"
