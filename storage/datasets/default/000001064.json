	"description": "In the end, an accident happens, and a wisp of fragrant soul from another world awakens inside this body. The strongest female immortal, Lin Rui, looks at herself in the mirror, repulsed by the thick, smoky makeup on her face, and her colorful hair. She purses her lips and thinks to herself, ’This… What on earth is this?!’ \r\n\r\n 'Mr. Yun, the cables attached to the diva Lin Rui's body are broken, she’s left suspending on the only one that’s still intact!” \r\n\r\n 'It's okay,' Yun Ze says in a proud tone. \r\n\r\n 'Mr. Yun, Diva Lin Rui went to the primeval forest to participate in a reality show, and brought a bunch of beasts back with her!” \r\n\r\n 'Let her be,' Yun Ze says indulgently. \r\n\r\n 'Mr. Yun, Diva Lin Rui's scandal is on the hot search, rumor has it that she is with a mysterious man… Huh? Where did Mr. Yun go?'>"
