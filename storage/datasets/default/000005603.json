	"description": "Lilyca was a girl from the slums who lived with her drunk mother. \n\nAnd then one day…\n\n“No, it’s hot! No!”\n\nHer mother woke up screaming,\n\n“Lily, you’re alive! Are you younger?”\n\nShe was talking nonsense.\n\n“What date is it today?”\n\nShe must have lost her mind.\n\n“Oh my gosh, I’m back!”\n\nThen, she panicked and said,\n\n“I have to go to the imperial ball and meet His Majesty!”\n\n‘What nonsense is that? I’m starting to wonder what happened to my mother’s head.’>"
