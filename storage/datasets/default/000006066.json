	"description": "Reality…will swallow you.\n\nYe Xiao, the criminal investigator whose hobby is eating and who never knows how to read the atmosphere, encounters an unimaginable case.\n\nAs usual, there is a dead body from a homicide case. But what is slightly different this time is that—\n\nThey find the deceased’s own, destroyed hands in his stomach.\n\nExactly how much pain had he endured to die by eating his own hands?\n\nThis is not the only strange murder case. And behind all the cases is the same hidden figure…\n\nLike this, Ye Xiao and his partner, Su Mu, start to carry out the investigation.\n\nIt’s just that Ye Xiao's cold colleague, who looks unfazed even when encountering mysterious events, seems to be…pretty strange too?>"
