	"description": "Yin Li was born with a pure Yin body. He possessed the body of a male but the fate of a female, his Yin and Yan energies fully inverted. Because of this, his family’s old ancestors claimed he wouldn’t be able to live past twenty years of age.\n\nTo prolong his life, his parents fostered a furnace whose energy he could harvest to nurture his own.\n\nAs Yin Li looked at the frail and delicately charming boy in front of him, he felt his heart stir with compassion.\n\nThe Heavenly Path is carried through reincarnation, life and death are decided by fate.\n\nHe couldn’t simply ruin this pitiful child for the sake of his own selfish interests. Instead, he kept the small boy at his side, spoiling him and raising him as his trusted aide.\n\nHe truly believed they shared a master and servant’s pure and honest affection, not at all realizing that that wicked boy had been rotten from the start. The delicately charming small boy who was spoiled day and night only ever thought about two things:\n\n1. Why hasn’t master bestowed his favour on me yet?\n\n2. Just how can I climb into master’s bed?>"
