Pursued and envied by the high gods of all realms, her spirit was sucked into the black hole. There she entered the sixth daughter of the Ye family’s body, one of the four major clans of Lingwu. She could speak at five months old, walk at six months old, read at seven months old, and finished the entire Ye family’s library collection at six years old. However, the clan abandoned her when she was unable to cope with the toxic poison within her body blocking her qi* flow hence incapable to absorb cultivate or cultivate fighting energy. Following the downfall of her parents, the poison spread and she perished. Her spirit then became joined together with the cultivated prodigy.\n\nWhen two spirits are joined together, what kind of tides will the appearance of this new Zi Luo bring?
