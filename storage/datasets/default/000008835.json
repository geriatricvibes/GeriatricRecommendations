	"description": "Meeting for the first time, he rushed to him with joy but was kicked off by someone’s merciless kick!\n\nThe second time, Ye Xuan Chen put down his grand words: “Someday, I’ll personally make surrender …”\n\nLing Tian sneered: “Just you?”\n\nHe smiled craftily: “Yes! Just me …. “\n\nIt wasn’t until one night when Ling Tian was pressed to the bed by a shameless man that he understood the meaning of that sentence!\n\nThis is the story of the rebirth of a cultivator who transmigrated into the body of a modern rich second generation.\n\nSee how he changes from an unenthusiastic mediocre student, a hedonistic son of rich parents, a hooligan and a waste who depends on his parents into a heaven defying male god who can be looked up to, a top student and becomes an influential figure!\n\nOf course, slapping people’s faces is just his side business. Ye Xuan Chen’s main business is to knock someone down!\n\n“I owe you so much, I already can’t pay, so I can only use my body to pay….”\n\n“Scram!”>"
