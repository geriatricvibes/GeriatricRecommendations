	"description": "Xiao Tu (Little Rabbit) and Lang Lang (“Wolfie Wolf”)’s first meeting wasn’t a good one. But Xiao Tu won the match. It proved to be her downfall.\n\nLang Lang was Xiao Tu’s new boss and hell bent on revenge for the minor slight, or so it seemed. No amount of pervy Rabbit’s cunning could win against the stinky, even pervier Wolf.\n\nHe had got her in his paws and he was never letting her go.>"
