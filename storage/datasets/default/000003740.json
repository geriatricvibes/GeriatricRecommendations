	"description": "In front of people, she was an ordinary student who had no background and came out of the county with a playful smile on her lips. Afterward, she was a business king who had been paving the way for prosperity in China. Wei Sheng was accidentally reborn in the autumn of 1998 and had to face heavy school work, the cold eyes of her relatives, her parents' expectations, and clear class discrimination again. When re-entering the stage of history, how could she let everything repeat itself? But she was sad to find that the television station had to take a break every afternoon? There was no computer or iPad, small books were the paradise of children's dreams.>"
