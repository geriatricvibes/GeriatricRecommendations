	"description": "This is a world where the living have become the undead, a world where faith remains unwavering but yet crumbles, a world where everything is available but yet, nothing remains.\n\nWe yearn for salvation and hope for a downfall with cold cruelty as we act out with our insanity and zealous nature. We may be as strong as the gods, but we’re also as ignoble as ants…\n\nStop and you’ll be in hell, but going forward is just the same, only at a different place.>"
