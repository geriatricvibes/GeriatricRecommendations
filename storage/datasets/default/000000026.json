	"description": "Chinatsu Sugito is a tsundere girl.\n\nShe is scorned by her childhood friend whom she likes because of a misunderstanding. Masataka Sano, who happened to witness the scene, saw his chance and stood up to take advantage of it. Although Masataka has been in love with Chinatsu, she has known a boy since she was born. He had half given up on her, but suddenly an opportunity presented itself. Not wanting to let this opportunity pass, Masataka relentlessly took advantage of Chinatsu’s weak heart.\n\nChinatsu’s heart gradually unraveled. She can no longer live without him…. Even when Osako realizes that the nagging tsundere girl is his kind and beautiful childhood friend, it’s too late!>"
