	"description": "To impress the girl he has a crush on, Kouichi (a high schooler) lets her use his address in a gay ad. Soon, a reply comes, and Kouichi finds himself meeting with the man he made a joke of, intending to reject him. But he was surprised to find out that the man is actually a teacher in his school! Hirokazu is a really nice man. He seemed so lonely that Kouichi just couldn't find it in himself to hurt him. One date leads to another, and Kouichi falls for his teacher for real... the problem is, Hirokazu doesnâ€™t know that Kouichi is a student at his workplace.\n\nA sweet, down-to-earth story.\n\n(The book art is quite atrocious, ignore it and read chapter 1.)>"
