	"description": "Fu Li was a yaoguai from the countryside who had never seen the world. After entering the city, his biggest dream was to become a civil servant and leave his name in historical records.\r\n\r\nHowever… He didn’t have a university degree. Not even a high school graduation certificate.\r\n\r\nSo, even a yaoguai would not be able to find a good job if they didn’t study well.>"
