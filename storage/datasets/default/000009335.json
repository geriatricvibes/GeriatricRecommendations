	"description": "This is the story of Ledge, a man who lives for his hobbies.\r\n\r\nDiving into the latest VRMMO, our protagonist is dropped on an unexplored planet as a mechanical doll and tasked with its Reclamation. But he had other plans. Namely, doing anything but taking part in this whole Reclamation business.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a skill that was only considered to be a “hobby skill” turned out to be much more…\r\n\r\nAlong his travels, he comes across an anything-can-be-solved-with-enough-brute-force bunny girl, a cool beauty, a shield martial artist young woman, a samurai girl and a ninja boy.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by his eccentric gang, he sets about conquering the planet one whim at a time!>"
