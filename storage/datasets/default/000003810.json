	"description": "*The Four Great Female Constables – Book 1/4\n\n\nNot all women in the world desire to fight for the position of the main wife.\n\nJust like Bai Yuxiao who is very happy to be a concubine since she does not need to care about other things. Since she can sleep well, eat well, and live well, compared to the swords and shadows that lurk in Jianghu, the fight for power in the inner courtyards is like house wine.\n\nWhen she is free and at leisure, she can also tease these women and she can also regulate herself mentally and physically ~ ~\n\nHowever, this can only be used to pass the time. She still has to take care of her own important business. Although being a constable may seem dangerous, it could bring great wealth if exploited properly.\n\nWho would have known that her husband, the Wangye who had not entered her bedchamber for two years, would suddenly look for her every day and cultivate on her every night!>"
