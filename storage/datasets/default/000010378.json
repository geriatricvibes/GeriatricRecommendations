	"description": "Zhuang Han Yan was the golden branch of the marquis family, simple and gentle. She lived a harmonious life, with a loving family and kind older sister. However, on the night of her wedding, all that was waiting for her was a cup of poisonous wine delivered from her husband.\r\n\r\n'Younger sister, you should drink quickly. Tonight is a wonderful night for the prince and I.' \r\n\r\nHer previously “kind” older sister had schemed against Han Yan maliciously, stealing everything from her. Han Yan's stepmother finally revealed a hypocritical face under her mask of love and Han Yan realised the man she loved was not a good man. All the happiness she had experienced had turned out to be an illusion!\r\n\r\nShe died with hatred and was reborn, returning to the age of twelve, vowing to rewrite her fate. Step by step, she was going to fight her way through the treacherous inner residence and exact revenge on the people who insulted, deceived and trampled over her.>"
