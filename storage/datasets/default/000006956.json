	"description": "“To be my wife, you have to keep the three things I said earlier. Can you do it? If you don’t want to, go back now.”\n\nWhat Sang-yeon wanted from Minju was a wife and a ghost bride. A being that exists, but does not exist.\n\n“No, this is my home now. I’m not going back.”\n\nMinju and Sang-yeon agreed to a secret marriage between the two unbeknownst to the rest of the world.\n\nWhy didn’t Minju suspect it even once?\n\nShe should have been suspicious of Park Sang-yeon, a world-renowned conductor representing Korea, when he said he loved her.\n\nAs to the real reason why he wanted to marry her.>"
