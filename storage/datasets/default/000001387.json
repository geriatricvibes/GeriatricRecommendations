	"description": "I reincarnated into a novel.\n\nMy role here has quite the extravagant modifiers.\n\nDisgrace of the nine families. House Chantra’s sickly burden. Dreary poisonous witch. Completely hopeless sexual degenerate…\n\n“The family’s problem child? It’s really me?”\n\nAfter realizing that I got reincarnated, I was so confused because of the memory loss and sudden change in personality.\n\nMore than that, I’m also destined to die soon. See, this is a BL novel, and apparently I’m the fiancée of the main character.\n\nAnd so began the attempt to seduce the world’s top predator who would save me, no questions asked.\n\n“Oh my, are you alone now? My fiancé.”\n\n“This covetous woman! Please, stop taking my heart with you—my heart!”\n\nBut what’s this. For some reason, the attempt at seduction was working frighteningly well…?\n\n“Just as you asked, I took care of everything. But why are you leaving. I did everything you told me to.”\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nI think I chose the wrong rope as a lifeline.>"
