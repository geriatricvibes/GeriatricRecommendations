	"description": "The villainous young master Dark Demon finally recalled the memories of his previous life at the sorting ceremony of the Dueling Academy. He was reborn in a very strange Galgame world.\n\nAnd he was the ultimate villain in the game, the Demon God of Seven Original Sins!\n\nSuperbia、Invidia、Ira、Accidia、Avaritia、Gula、Luxuria！\n\nOnce any one of these seven indicators broke through the critical value, he would irreversibly transform into the Demon God!\n\nIn the era of Saint Marian, where the demons had been completely destroyed and the demon king had fallen into eternal sleep, no heresy was allowed to survive!>"
