	"description": "Atsushi Yamagami is being avoided in his class because of rumors that he had hit the face of a girl student at another school and was sent to the hospital in retaliation.\nThat Atsushi, he has a little special ability.\nHe’s able to sniff out the scent of supernatural powers… something like that. Thanks to that ability… no, because of that ability, he finds out that Yuri Shirasawa, a beautiful girl that is regarded as the number one or two at school, is a person with supernatural power, ‘Telepathy’.\nOnly Atsushi knows about her telepathy. Perhaps because of it, Yuri has come to send telepathy to Atsushi frequently.\n\n『”Atsushi-san, please help me collect the materials for the game, help meー”』\n『”Don’t want to”』\n『”Atsushi-san , please tell me the answer to this question, tell meー”』\n『”Don’t cheat”』\n『”Atsushi-san, I don’t mind with steak for dinner today. steakー”』\n『”Why does it sound as if you’re going to eat at my place?”』\n『”Ah, Atsushi-san!! These extroverts invited me to go play, I humbly request your assistance as soon as possible!!!”』\n『Why do you hate it so much…”』\n\nYuri goes to the class with a mysterious impression as she rarely talks, but in reality, she’s an introvert, and so, whenever she is invited by the people around her to do something, she doesn’t know what to do.\nAnd Atsushi who could hear her telepathy is, being used by her, every time she wants to decline the invitation.\n\nThis is a romantic comedy that happens in the telepathy behind their silence… or you could say, it’s a ‘Telepathy Romcom’.>"
