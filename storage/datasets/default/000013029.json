Loewen Military Academy is a prestigious military academy, the only one in the kingdom authorised to teach magic. There, Mahoro meets Noah, from the noble House of St Johns. Noah is immensely popular and even boasts his own personal fan club, but he only shows interest in Mahoro, a struggling cadet who can barely keep up with the lessons. According to Noah, he says that his instincts tell him to make Mahoro his, but suddenly a storm sweeps over what was supposed to be a peaceful academy life!? This is the start of a saga of magic, dragons, love and conflict—and the secrets that entangle them!\n\nVolume 1: Bloodlines Ablaze\nVolume 2: Bloodlines Astorm>"
