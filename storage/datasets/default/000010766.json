	"description": "An Ning is a poor law student at A University. He’s nice, hardworking and has a huge sense of justice. His time is spent on studying and working to provide for himself.\n\nQin Weihang is a handsome law student who is blunt and closed-off. He rarely attends classes and doesn’t put effort in his studies. Most of his time is spent outside of school doing the one thing he loves—rock climbing.\n\nTwo people with different personalities became roommates at the start of the school year. \n\nThis is a slow journey of a blossoming relationship between the top student and the school’s grass of the Faculty of Law.>"
