	"description": "He was a successful businessman and reputedly, someone who preferred men, so Song Wenxin agreed to marry him. However, once they were married, she realized with a shock that he was in fact the biggest liar! He had commanded, “You must be at my beck and call; and never avoid my calls. You are not to reject any gifts from me. Above all, you must not stop……loving me!” Song Wenxin had retorted, “Dream on!” He had laughed mockingly, “What a coincidence! I have a knack for making dreams come true!” He showered her with love, satisfying her every whim and fancy without question.>"
