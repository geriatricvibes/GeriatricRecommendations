	"description": "Gareth is a mercenary who carries the scent of blood wherever he goes. There was no need for family; he lived a life where death awaits him at any moment, but yet he took Elena to his estate.\r\n\r\nElena is the eldest daughter of the Townsend family. Nevermind her desolate estate, her family was on the brink of poverty, so she decides to be Gareth’s wife.\r\n\r\nTo Gareth, Elena was like a lantern that shone silently in the dark, and he was the turbulent wind trying to light out her lantern.>"
