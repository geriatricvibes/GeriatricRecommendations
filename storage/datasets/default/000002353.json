	"description": "The day Jane decided to leave, she was stopped by Liang Jingxing as soon as she walked out of the villa.\r\n\r\n'How dare you?'\r\n\r\n'You see, I dare not.' Jane Chu pushed her suitcase and passed him.\r\n\r\nAfter five years with Liang Jingxing, Jane found out that the man only thought she was 'Just playing'. She learned from the pain and made up her mind to leave him.\r\n\r\nOne night soon after, Liang Jingxing was waiting at the door of Jane Chu's new residence and happened to see her taking a male model back.\r\n\r\n'Baby.' Liang Jingxing's black pupils narrowed dangerously staring at her with smoke between his fingertips, 'You've played too much, you know?'\r\n\r\nJane Chu walked towards him, raised her head slightly, and smiled sarcastically, 'President Liang, who are you? Dare to control me?'\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the famous cynical and domineering man turned a little red in his eyes.\r\n\r\nLater, in order to get Jane back, Liang Jingxing proposed to her for many times, but she refused without exception. He can only follow her around.\r\n\r\nThen, a reporter photographed the two people traveling together in Paris and acting close. He posted it on Weibo with the caption:\r\n\r\n#Shock_Designer_Jane_turned_out_to_be_the_lover_of_President_Liang#\r\n\r\nThis became trending immediately.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jane woke up, she saw the news and kicked the man beside her unhappily.\r\n\r\nLiang Jingxing woke up from his sleep because of her kick. He took his mobile phone, and quickly sent a document to clarify: It's the opposite.\r\n\r\nNetizen: '...'\r\n\r\nLiang Jingxing: I'm actually her lover.\r\n\r\nNetizen: '...'\r\n\r\nPutting down the mobile phone, Liang Jingxing took Jane Chu back to his arms, coaxing her: 'You see, everyone already knows our relationship. It's hard to end it without getting married.'\r\n\r\nJane closed her eyes: 'Are you in a hurry?'\r\n\r\nLiang Jingxing: '...:\r\n\r\nCan't he take it easy? He has already proposed for the nth times!>"
