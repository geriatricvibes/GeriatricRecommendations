	"description": "The prestigious He family was reunited with their long-lost heir. Everybody was looking forward to the Revenge of the Real Daughter or some cliché stories prestigious family drama. Alas, the long-lost Chu Qianli was only interested in playing cards, dice, and spreading superstitions (?).\n\n Chu Qianli transmigrated into a little white flower in a novel with a strong female lead. She had no interest in meddling in the fight over gains in a wealthy family or the romance between the male and female leads. All she wanted to do was focus on her astrology and her pursuit in Marxism. \n\n Original Male Lead: “Aren’t you going to fight over the family fortune with me?”\n\nChu Qianli: “No way. You do the work; I take the dividends. I am a dawg if I ever set foot in the company.”\n\n The entire world knew that the surname of the daughter of the He family was not He. Her specialty was Tarot cards, numerology, seeing into the future, and she was never wrong!\n\n “Lao He, I need your daughter’s help!”\n\n“I’m so sorry. She just started university and is not home.”\n\n“……Oh? What is she majoring in?”\n\n“Marxist Philosophy.”\n\n“? ? ?”\n\n Chu Qianli: I might be a guru in numerology but I am a firm believer in Marxism. I am not a fortune teller.”>"
