	"description": "“We have sailed for centuries, lost our motherland, lost our way, and lost the love symbolised by the rose.”\n\nWhen the world met its doom, the Voyager sailed away from Earth. \n\nLin Si was a top biologist on the Voyager, whose life’s only failure was an experiment sample who never woke up from his genetic modification project, “limitless”. \n\nAfter a black hole incident, the radiation caused an unknown mutation in the experiment sample and it regained consciousness. Where is this supposed “strongest combat-type mutant”? Who is this squeamish little bun? Huh? >"
