Only when she gets seven hearts safely can she go home? \n\nAfter many deaths, Bai Xun knew it, and could only live by paying closer attention!! \n\nThis game is also known as “Jianzhen Handbook”, “My Seven Boyfriends”, “I was Careless in a Shura Field”! Green tea bit*h is in a fragrant garden, and the white lotus is a b*tch!>"
