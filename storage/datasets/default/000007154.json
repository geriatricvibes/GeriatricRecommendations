	"description": "Sheng Yi can’t believe her high school classmate Jiang Lianzhou would become tremendously popular now;\n\nWhat’s even more unbelievable is that she, a non-celebrity, would have to record a variety show with this top star;\n\nBut the most unbelievable thing is, the CP between her and Jiang Lianzhou had unexpectedly gone viral overnight.\n\nOne huge CP fan posted a Weibo to the circle:\n\n“It’s been years since Jiang Lianzhou rose to stardom, yet he has never been involved in any scandal. I thought it was impossible for him to like other people. \n\nBut nowadays I discovered that, as it turned out, a top star could also be secretly in love with someone for so many years. He treasures the old notes she wrote, remembers all her preferences, and was overflowing with happiness when reunited with her after long separation.\n\nPlease let my CP be together and make his secret love wish come true.”\n\nSheng Yi stared at this Weibo post, then glanced at the thick variety show script in her hand, then looked towards the TV..\n\nInside the screen, the top star is currently acting incredibly affectionate, proceeding according to the script,”Have I ever confessed to my secret love? Yes, I have. I confessed through QQ, I told her ‘I want to be together with you’.”\n\nSheng Yi: “…”\n\nHe sure can act out this exceptionally fake script quite naturally, huh.\n\n———\n\nSheng Yi cooperated with Jiang Lianzhou and meticulously played her role as his crush to boost their CP. Following the variety show that is coming to an end, the CP is on the verge of dissolvement.\n\nThat day, Jiang Lianzhou QQ account was suddenly leaked out. Despite his studio’s immediate denial, it still stirred up an uproar.\n\nWhen a friend came looking for Sheng Yi to seek the truth, she sneered,”You can tell it’s fake with one look, I have his real QQ account during highschool.”\n\nShe casually copied the username circulated online into the search bar, only to find that it was actually in her close friends list.\n\nMoreover, the note she added for him is——\n\nFoolishStrangerX\n\nAnd the chat history stopped at 6.9 on their senior year.\n\n “I want to be together with you.”>"
