I was reincarnated as a Villainess.\r\n\r\nIt seems that I was reincarnated into the world of an Otome Game that I played in my previous life, but even if I use my knowledge, my death flags may or may not be broken.......\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to live my life seriously and sincerely as a Young Noble Lady. >"
