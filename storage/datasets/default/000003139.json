	"description": "Xia Xiaoluo never expected that a takeout delivery would change her life forever. \r\n\r\nThe rainy night, that insane man and the thing he forced her to do, were the things Xia Xiaoluo earnestly prayed to forget about. \r\n\r\nHowever, Ling Tianyi, the man who violated her, would not let Xia Xiaoluo go that easily. \r\n\r\nBeing the youngest and richest man in City A, Ling had the reason to believe it must be dramatically easy to occupy the little poor girl. To his surprise, however, he found it unexpectedly difficult to obtain Xia Xiaoluo’s love. \r\n\r\nUrged to get married by his parents, Ling Tianyi had a thought in mind. \r\n\r\nWill Ling Tianyi get his way? What a dramatic love story will they create? It’s time to find out. >"
