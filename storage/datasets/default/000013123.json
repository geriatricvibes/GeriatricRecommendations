	"description": "A Virtual Reality Web-Novel featuring me – a male protagonist. My best friend killed himself because of his mentally addictive heartbreaking romance with an NPC in a VR game. My wife moans loudly, as she attempts to secretly cheat on me with some guy in our bedroom.\n\nOh, and one more thing. After all this crap happened, the author sent me back in time. You gotta agree that this has to be one hell of a lucky coincidence. But then again, is my best friend’s suicide the main reason for this revolution? I mean, what else could be the explanation for me, time-traveling into the past? I guess reading this novel is my only way of finding out what happens next.>"
