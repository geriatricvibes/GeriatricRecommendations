	"description": "Song Yi is a sweet and gentle scum who grew up wandering up to the sky.\n\nGu Xingchuan is a suave male god whose beauty crushes everything.\n\nFor the same white moonlight affection, the two have fought for many years.\n\nUntil Song Yi changed from a man with eight pack abs to an omega exuding the scent of sweet milk.\n\nIn front of everyone, Gu Xingchuan pinned Song Yi against the wall and smiled disdainfully, he then lowered his head and sniffed the warm, soft smell.\n\n“Your pheromones smell exactly the same as White Moonlight’s, I’m sure you’re seducing me.”\n\nSong Yi: “…”\n\nGu Xingchuan: “If you are not seducing me, why can’t I help but want to kiss you?”>"
