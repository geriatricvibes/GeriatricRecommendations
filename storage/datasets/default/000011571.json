	"description": "What if you have a smart, playful and faithful boyfriend?\n\nWhen dating, he said: “I have no interest in these sort of things. But if you kiss me every ten minutes, I am willing to do any sort of silly things with you.\n\nWhen jealous, he said: “Compared to me, this man had s*upid written all over him. The only good point he has is that he knows you are a good woman too.\n\nWhen making love, he said: “Although I have no experience, my intelligence and ability to learn far surpass normal people. Just to add, I am very observant as well.\n\nWhen proposing, he said: “I have no words to express myself. But if I have to sum everything up – I love you with all of my wisdom and life.\n\nI took him from a lonely world, back to the warmth of the bustling city.\n\nWhile he drags me from a quiet and ordinary life to a exciting and unpredictable life.>"
