	"description": "In order to be reborn, Shen Mubai took up the task of saving the male lead from the path of suffering. Xuanzang struggled through eighty-one trials before he finally obtained the true Buddhist scripture, and yet she, Shen Mubai, had to toss in her entire self. \n\nShen Mubai: Are all male leads this strange? Thanks. I want to make a complaint. \n\nSystem: What does him being strange have to do with me?\n\nNote: Xuanzang is a character in Journey to the West based on the historical buddhist monk Xuanzang. He journeys to obtain the Sanzangjing, “Three Collections of Scriptures”.>"
