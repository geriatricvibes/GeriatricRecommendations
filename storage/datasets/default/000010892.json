	"description": "“August-sama… Is everything, inside?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, everything’s inside. It really hurts, right?”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t hurt,” Eeva replied with a straight face.\r\n\r\nApparently she couldn’t give in.\r\n\r\n“But, my belly is full of August-sama’s big, hot stuff… And I’m thinking, ‘so this is is sex’…”\r\n\r\nShe squeezed their connected hands.\r\n\r\n“We, have become one, haven’t we…?”\r\n\r\nThe inside of Eeva’s v*gina felt extremely good.
