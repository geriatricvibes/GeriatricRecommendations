	"description": "In his past life, the little terrified bun, Wei Jing, tried attracting his father’s attention by summoning his courage to fight for inheritance against the elder brother who pampered him. He was badly bruised and hurt as a result of it.\n\nIn the end, he was kicked out of the family by his father and he died as a result of a car accident.\n\nIn this life, he decided to be a good child, not causing trouble nor being willful. He won’t try to steal the company from his elder brother.\n\nBest, he’ll stay far away from the family.\n\nThe reborn Wei Zhe watched as his sweet little brother gradually distanced himself from him.\n\n“Heh! You want to leave? Did you ask me first?”>"
