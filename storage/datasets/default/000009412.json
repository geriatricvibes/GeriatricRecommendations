	"description": "'How would it be if a fairy became your wife?.'\r\n\r\nJiang Qiao answered this question while silently crying, 'You can't smoke or drink. The pressure cooker at home became an alchemy stove, and sleeping at night became meditation.'\r\n\r\nSlight footsteps gradually approached, and Jiang Qiao immediately changed his expression, excitedly saying, 'You can't imagine the benefits of having a fairy as a wife! Her charming and impeccable face is so enticing!.'\r\n\r\nSoon, an ethereal beauty bent down and gave Jiang Qiao a kiss on the cheek.>"
