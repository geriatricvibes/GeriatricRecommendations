	"description": "He was the CEO of the Mu’s Group. He had a respectable status and a domineering attitude. His biggest weakness was that he doted on his daughter. For his precious daughter, he came to her and signed a contract for her to be his daughter’s nanny. She thought it would be fine to stick to the contract, but he interfered more and more with her, driving away every man around her without leaving a trace, locking her in his arms, saying to her affectionately and tyrannically, “We should give a companion to our daughter.”>"
