	"description": "Three thousand years ago, Qinghuan died under Nanyang’s sword and left a farewell letter. Her longing to become Nanyang’s wife was written between the lines.\r\n\r\nThree thousand years later, at the beginning of the story, Nanyang married her. For the rest of our lives, you must be my wife.\r\n\r\nThree thousand years of wandering, for just a short reunion.\r\n\r\nThe things owed to her in the past will now be made up for, one by one, until paid in full.\r\n\r\nThree thousand years ago, one was an aloof, iceberg master, and the other a gentle and humble apprentice.\r\n\r\nNanyang: Go away. Don’t touch me. Presumptuous! Troublemaker!\r\n\r\nQinghuan: Master, look at me. I’ll cook for you and wash your clothes, (╥﹏╥)\r\n\r\nThree thousand years later, one is the humble boss who always tries to please her wife, and the other is an indifferent and glamorous celebrity.\r\n\r\nQinghuan: Don’t spend money on me, don’t treat me well. I won’t like you.\r\n\r\nNanyang: o(〒﹏〒)o Wife, I’ll wash your clothes and cook for you, please take a bite.\r\n\r\nGlamorous and gentle mature woman gong X cold and gentle mature woman shou.>"
