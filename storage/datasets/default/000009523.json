	"description": "Why do they keep killing him off? What did he ever do wrong?\r\n\r\nA fan of the Otome dating game finds that her ultimate bias, Lumins, ends up dead in every route but one.\r\n\r\nAfter completing all routes of the game, a mysterious voice asks for her wish. Furious and choked up, she shouts to save her ultimate bias and to give him a happy life.\r\n\r\nWaking up as Senephin, the villainess who harasses the main character, she enjoys her dream where she could talk to Lumins, alive and well.\r\n\r\nThat is, until, ‘Senephin’ realizes that her new self was not a dream.\r\n\r\nSenephin remembers that the only time Lumins survived his damned endings was when he ended up together with the female lead, Velkina. Realizing this, she makes it her utmost priority to get Lumins and Velkina together.\r\n\r\nBut for some reason, Lumins seems more interested in Senephin than the original female lead. Will ‘Senephin’ be able to save Lumins?>"
