	"description": "I possessed an extra in the novel I wrote.\n\nThe problem is, this novel is a waste and unfinished.\n\n[ The constellation, ‘Queen of Flowers and Nymphs’ is watching you.]\n\nBut suddenly, a system window pops up and the constellations appear.\n\n…There was no such setting in my novel?\n\n“You didn’t even say anything.”\n\n[ ‘The Queen of Flowers and Nymphs’ grabs her chest. ]\n\n[ ‘The Librarian of Nipur’ takes a deep breath. ]\n\n[ ‘The Guardian of the Golden Field’ swings his fists wildly. ]\n\nWhen I speak in the form of a child who can’t even pronounce well, the constellations started clamoring about my cuteness.\n\nTurns out, they called me in to complete this novel!\n\nWell, first of all, I need to stop the villain in this book from interfering with the love of the main characters.\n\nHowever, the villainous duke seems to be more friendly than I expected.\n\nAnd the Crown Prince, the male lead, is suddenly coming here…\n\nOkay, I will cut off the roots of his obsession!\n\n“I like being with Riche, too.”\n\nFrederick seems to like being alone with me for some reason.\n\nCan I finish this novel safely?>"
