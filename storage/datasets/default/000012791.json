	"description": "A relaxing story of a business tycoon who, sick of machinations and struggle, returned to the medieval world and married into a merchant family to become a “Zhui Xu”, a husband that lives in the wife’s home. Even though his intentions were not so, he could not avoid the matters of family, country and world.\n\n“There was once a person that stood at the top of the golden pyramid, with innumerable cheap jealousy and envy of people, walking this road, he was escorted by tens of thousands of people, yet he could not escape the long and lonely sleep under the gravestone.”>"
