I thought it was too much. However, it was a disaster to say that the woman chosen by the main character of the ridiculous newspaper advertisement was my own 20-year-old sister, who has an age difference of more than 13 years with that man. What a freak!\n\nAfter taking the trouble to keep my sister away and save her, the man said to her with a flat face. ‘No pheasants, only chicken.’\n\nChicken? Who’s a chicken? Now he’s offering me to be his contract wife!>"
