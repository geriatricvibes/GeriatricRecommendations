	"description": "My mother remarried and I had a younger brother.\n\nWith a happy heart, I tried to be a family with my younger brother, Millian. No matter how hard he behaved, it didn’t matter.\n\nDid my effort shine?\n\nI’m relieved that we’ve gotten quite close. Millian left a letter and went to war.\n\nIt’s been 5 years since Millian went to war.\n\n[Millian, I’m going to see you this time.]\nWho knew my letter would end the five-year-long war?\n\n“Now i’m not your brother anymore.”\n\nMillian fluttered a document that he had been expelled from the family.\n\n“Sister, don’t laugh at other men. Only if you don’t want to make me a murderer.”\n\nMillian Edmore Rachel. No, now it’s Millian Taylor.\n\nMy younger brother returned as a man.\n\nIt’s sad that he’s a someone else right now, but what?\n\nHe’s going to be a husband?\n\n….But why am I so nervous?\n\nI shouldn’t do this.>"
