	"description": "Giorg, the Marquis of Zafing, has been treated coldly by his family.\n\nHis mother had died five years ago, and his father had remarried soon after. He had a younger brother, Leon, who was the same age as him, so it was obvious that his father was having an affair.\n\nHe treated Giorg poorly and only loved his stepmother and half-brother.\n\nOne day, after five years of Giorg’s mistreatment. Fiona, the Countess, Giorg’s fiancée, announces that she is breaking off the engagement, and Leon stands beside her with a disgusted smile on his face.\n\n“I will take your fiancée.”\n\n“I will not marry an incompetent like you.”\n\nThese were the words of two people who had not the slightest sense of guilt. Giorg did not show any anger when he was insulted, but when he heard some words, he ordered his subordinates without hesitation.\n\nWhat was his order?\n\n“Seize these two”‘\n\nFrom there, Giorg started his turn to fight back.>"
