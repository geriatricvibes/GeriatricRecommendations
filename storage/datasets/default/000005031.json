That is, until he became a woman and laid in bed with a white-cast complexion……\n\nChatting in the female dormitory at night, roommates sighed over the current pairings in the school of engineering, Shen Xi was a little curious that the problem with these topics is that there was no way to test them. Until she became a male engineering student and a bar of soap dropped in front of her……\n\nIntroduction in one sentence: About how a top-scoring perfect male with no desire in the opposite gender and an amusing female lead were set up like lightning setting the ground on fire spreading out of control—leading to a sweet and rippling life……\n\nLife is so long, don’t be so arrogant. Some things are bound to deviate.>"
