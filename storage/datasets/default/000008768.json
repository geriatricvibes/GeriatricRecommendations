	"description": "“I’ve never seen a woman with hair as red as blood as lady.”\n\nBlood dripped down as if waiting and soaked the floor. Belial held out the blood-stained sword. But Rose couldn’t care less about it because,\n\n“What do you think? Isn’t it as beautiful as lady’s hair?”\n\nBelial Le Serenity.\n\nBecause the man that I’ve been looking for such a long time, immediately took an interest in me as soon as he saw me.\n\nI possesed a supporting role in a romance novel. In addition, I would be killed by a villain sub-male before the female lead appears.\n\nBy the way,\n\nThe very Belial who did not let go of the heroine until the moment of his death,\n\n“You are as quiet as a flower in the field, as dazzling as the sun in the sky, as graceful as a deer playing in the mountains.”\n\nI’m talking about this.\n\nI thought I’d live a rough life and get killed. But it seems that this villain has no intention of killing me.>"
