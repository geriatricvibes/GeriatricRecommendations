	"description": "Ruan Yan was in an unofficial relationship with Shen Jin for two years. People said that Ruan Yan’s love for Shen Jin was a submissive one since she was willing to be his substitute lover.\n\nEven Shen Jin thought it was true.\n\nSo when Ruan Yan brought up the topic of breaking up, he just carelessly brushed the cigarette ashes away and said, “Have you made up your mind? It will be useless for you to beg me on your knees when you leave this door.”\n\nHowever, Ruan Yan answered very firmly, “Let’s break up.”\n\nShen Jin’s face became darker. He was almost clenching his teeth as he patronized her, “Very well.”\n\n*\n\nA month later, news of popular movie star Ruan Yan’s car accident was reported.\n\nIn the end, Shen Jin couldn’t help it. He was worried and drove to the hospital that night.\n\nHe was outside of the door when he saw Ruan Yan, who was lying on the hospital bed, choke up and ask her attending doctor, “Have you been hiding from me for the past three years?”\n\nWith that, she reached up and took off the doctor’s mask. His face was extremely similar to Shen Jin’s face.\n\nAt that moment, Shen Jin felt like he was given a heavy blow…\n\nHe realized that the man had the same scar as him on his throat!\n\n*\n\n—At first, he was just interested in her face.\n\n—Later, he fell for her and he realized, f***, she was only interested in his face.>"
