	"description": "Ma Xiaodong was a good-natured young man content with his lot in life. He had a job, a girlfriend, and a car. In this life, he had it made. One day he had a quarrel with his girlfriend who cursed his lack of ambition, saying that he should be struck by lightning from the heavens. As he drove through the pouring rain, a dazzling lightning bolt hit his car!\n\nUnbelievable… the heavens must have gotten something wrong!! As compensation for the mistake, the underworld’s emissary let him transmigrate into a good body with great fortune.\n\nThus he was reborn as a first-class prince in Ancient times. But what’s this? Why is the person in his bed a man? This is not good!>"
