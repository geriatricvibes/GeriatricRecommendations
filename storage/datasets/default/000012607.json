I fell in love with Lady Adriane Reese.”\r\n\r\n“Six engagements, Six break-ups.”\r\n\r\nThe princess’s fiancé always had an affair with the maids!\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to marry the crown prince, I want to live with my father forever…”\r\n\r\n“Such a useless being. Begone!”\r\n\r\nThe princess who is known to be weak and stupid, Apollonia.\r\n\r\nBut she has another hidden face…\r\n\r\n“It’s because the throne is hard to obtain, my father also spent 10 years on trying to kill my mother, the empress.”\r\n\r\nAs Apollonia grinned, her red eyes shone intensely. Usurpation of the throne.\r\n\r\nHer goal was clear. She was never shaken.\r\n\r\n‘I want to live my life with my father.’\r\n\r\nTo be exact, I want to live my life where my father is seated.\r\n\r\nPlease wait, father. Your daughter is on her way.\r\n\r\nTo take back everything that was stolen from me.>"
