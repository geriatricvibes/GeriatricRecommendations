	"description": "Charlotte, the second princess of a certain kingdom, has a secret she can't tell anyone. She can hear the voices in people's minds.\r\n\r\nBecause of her peculiar constitution, Charlotte has avoided contact with people as much as possible, but she is still a member of the royal family. She is constantly guarded by the Royal Guard.\r\n\r\nCharlotte avoids public appearances and spends most of her time in her room, and it seems that her guard is a lottery for the Royal Guard. One day, Charlotte couldn't believe her ears when she heard the voice of a newly assigned Royal Guard.\r\n\r\n[Aaah! How cute! What an angel! I love this place! She's so cute!! I'm going bald!]\r\n\r\nWhen Cain, a member of the Royal Guard, lets his thoughts spill out today, he doesn't know that Charlotte is listening.\r\n>"
