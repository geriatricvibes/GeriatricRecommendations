	"description": "[Welcome to 『The Opponent of the Dragon』.]\n“Oh my, the book talks!”\n\n[I am a guide for travelers who have transmigrated into the novel.]\nI possessed the body of Tiarozety Isol, a supporting character in 『The Opponent of the Dragon.』\n\nThe book will send me back to my world as soon as I complete the ending of the male lead, Lexion.\nThe problem is, I’ve never read this book before.\nBesides…\n\n[If the development of the story deviates from the original, the traveler gets a penalty right away.]\n“Penalty?”\n\n[Yes. The penalty is that the novel proceeds in the direction the traveler doesn’t want the most.]\n“Oh my god.”\n\nI was able to play the role of Tiarozety firmly. But then, I suddenly fell in love with the male lead, Lexion Sparrow.\n\n“I’ll miss you.”\nI was able to complete the ending by dying for him.\nHowever- There was a problem with the ending. Thus, I returned to the beginning of the novel again. Somehow, I was sent back again inside the novel on my way home.\nAnd-\n\n“Tia, choose me. Not this damn fate.”\n\n“………”\n\n“Choose me, even if the path is rough. Because I’m ready for anything.”\n\nAnd that’s how… Lexion, the male lead, began to cling onto me.>"
