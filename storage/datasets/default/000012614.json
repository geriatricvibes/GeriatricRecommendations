After a difficult life as a noble lady, Liliana finally decided to unleash her innate talent and became a blacksmith. Her goal was to fulfil her parents’ last wish—“I want you to live strong.”\n\nA few years later, Liliana became a hard-working court blacksmith. Although she had given up her happiness as a woman, sincerely giving her best for a kind hero she loved was her own way of finding happiness.\n\nOne day, she overheard a conversation between the hero and the princess;\n\n“If you keep treating her that nicely, won’t she get the wrong idea?”\n\n“That was never my intention… as if I would want such a disgusting, soot-covered, woman anywhere near me.”\n\nLiliana was shocked to learn that his gentle and sweet words were but lies to take advantage of her.\n\nAfterwards, the princess condemned Liliana, which resulted in the king exiling her.\n\nAt a loss, Liliana had a fateful encounter in the city of adventurers, Raceton.\n\nAfter her pure feelings had been toyed with, the exiled female blacksmith found a new place. It is a story of her attaining true happiness with the help of dependable friends.>"
