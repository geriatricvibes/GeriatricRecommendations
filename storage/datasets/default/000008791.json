	"description": "It is said that when Gong Yue was in a car accident, Ye Shanshan was filming in the deep mountains and forests. Just at that moment, the lollipop in his mouth fell to the ground. Ye Shanshan picked up the lollipop and pondered in silence– my golden backer.. did he collapse? \n\nWhen Gong Yue woke up, he found that he lost his memories. Afterwards, he caught sight of a cipher he had left prior to the accident– don’t trust anyone but Ye Shanshan.>"
