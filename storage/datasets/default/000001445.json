	"description": "Doctor Shi is a neurologist, his surgery skills are more accurate than a master chef using a knife to cut a melon. He is thirty-one years old and also the youngest director of neurology aka black belly boss.\n\nUnfortunately for Na Na who is a young nurse, she intentionally crosses path with the black belly Doctor Shi because she needs his legendary hands to perform a risky brain surgery on someone close to her heart… but unknown to Doctor Shi and Na Na, cupid’s shooting skills are stronger than their steely hearts.>"
