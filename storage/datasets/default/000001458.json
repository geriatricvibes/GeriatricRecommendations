	"description": "Ceres: a city without ethics or taboos, ruled by instincts and lust. These are the slums - immutable, eternal, home to those poor, caged could stricken with a perpetual melancholy.\r\n\r\nAfter three years, Riki unexpectedly returns to Ceres, but all is not well. The 'charisma' of the slums is a changed man. Faced with growing suspicion that he's lost his spark, and haunted by the memory of what happened during those three years away from the slum, Riki finds himself pulled into the escalating gang warfare as rivals attempt to wipe out his pack before they can regroup under their newly-returned leader. And then there is the frighteningly cold, regrettably familiar man he meets by chance one day; the beautiful Iason Mink. What secrets lie behind the smile of that bewitching Blondy?\r\n\r\nVol. 1: Stranger\r\nVol. 2: Destiny\r\nVol. 3: Nightmare\r\nVol. 4: Suggestion\r\nVol. 5: Darkness\r\nVol. 6: Metamorphose>"
