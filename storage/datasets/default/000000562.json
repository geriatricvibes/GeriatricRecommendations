	"description": "Dragon, Dragon Knight! Jet Fighter, Ace of the Air Force! \r\n\r\nA Dragon Knight from another world transmigrates and challenges the elites of the modern-day Air Force. He continuously trots on the path of strength. \r\n\r\nCountries battle in the shadows amidst an age of peace. The soldiers are never lonely. A Dragon Knight can transform into an air combat weapon made of steel which soars in the skies above. \r\n\r\nHeavens, who would be able to fight against him? \r\n\r\nIf a bomb carrier were like a chariot, pressuring the enemy all the way without any care; then the attack aircraft is akin to heavy cavalryâ€”always unexpectedly tearing a crack on the enemy's defense line. \r\n\r\nThe interceptor fighter is more like a knight. It intercepts the enemy's elite with concise and swift actions. It would destroy the target in one stroke and pull back, killing one person in ten steps and disappearing without a trace.>"
