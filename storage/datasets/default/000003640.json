	"description": "Nowadays, a lot of the games you can log in to are based on your sexual preference. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I am the guildmaster of a guild consisting of mostly casual players in a VRMMORPG that is played exclusively by men. In this game, there’s a big gap between the casual players and the hardcore players. Normally, there are hardly any chances of crossing paths with one another, with the exception of when you happen to join up in a party. \r\n\r\nHowever—all of that suddenly changes when logging out of the game becomes impossible.>"
