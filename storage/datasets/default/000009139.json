	"description": "Mo Li was a lunatic, and everyone was afraid of him, except Bai Cheng, and he was Mo Li’s light. They had been in love for five years, but just before they went abroad to get a marriage certificate, Bai Cheng was suddenly diagnosed with cancer.\n\nMo Li asked Bai Cheng what he wanted, and the always cheerful Bai Cheng said in a low voice that day – he wanted to go to college.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Bai Cheng’s healthy body to decline at a speed visible to the naked eye. He was in so much pain that he couldn’t sleep all night, but he was still able to comfort Mo Li with a smile.\n\nMo Li didn’t even have a chance to fulfill Bai Cheng’s last wish before he has lost his light. Mo Li was like a corpse. He has family and friends, but no one else matters after Bai Cheng left.\n\nThen one day, he woke up and suddenly found himself back in his senior year of high school.  This time it was his turn to become Bai Cheng’s light.\n\n**\n\nBai Cheng fell in love with the new transfer student.  He thought it was love at first sight.  Little did he know that the transfer student had been plotting against him for a long time.>"
