	"description": "I lived my whole life as a substitute for the lost princess.\n\nBut the moment the real princess came back,\n\n“Let’s be thankful that it ends like this.”\n\nI was sorrowfully abandoned.\n\n….. No, the ending would have been the same even if the real princess had not returned.\n\n“I think my usefulness is up to here, so I’ll leave now.”\n\n“If you come back, I’ll acknowledge you as a real daughter.” \n\n“I don’t need it.”\n\nI wouldn’t be loved by anyone, but it didn’t matter. I decided to live my own life completely.\n\n“It goes up high enough for everyone to look up to.”\n\n“I’ll make it like that for you.”\n\n“Don’t leave me. Do you get it?\n\nWhispering that he loves me, and even asking me if I knew it.>"
