	"description": "Second Prince of Xi Xuan – half of his life is grand and wild, half of his life is sadness and woe. Born in Xi Xuan but buried in an unnamed hill at death, unable to afford his very own coffin. – Yuan Tu, Great Fortune Teller of Xi Xuan.\n\nLife is always like this! He can never get what he wants, including this woman! He has always held her in respect and has even chased after her before. When he fell from grace, he did not implicate her, so what deep grievance does she hold against him to trample him to the ground like this? Since she is ganging up with that man to realize the woeful half of his life’s prophesy, he swears to himself that he is not going to make her life easy. Even if it is for just one day, he must live longer than them and witness their end!\n\nBut…\n\nWhy, when she is finally about to die, when Xi Xuan can no longer boast of their fabulous Xu Zhi, why did he nearly go crazy with grief? No, he is not going to let her die! Xi Xuan needs their Great Scholar and he must let her witness the demise of that wretched man before he breathe his last!>"
