	"description": "Decades after Minotaur, the God of Crete, was eradicated.\r\nThere was a new rumor in Delos, the sanctuary of ancient Greece.\r\nThe beast that will confuse the outside world and the curse of the goddess.\r\n\r\nRumor has it that 'the goddess of artemis' is in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe main character of the rumor, Lokira, was born with horns on her head.\r\n\r\n'The horned monster shouldn't go out into the world.'\r\n'You can't even meet a man outside.'\r\n'If you leave the sanctuary, you never know when you'll be hunted by someone.'\r\n\r\nMaybe she'll live the same life as he is.\r\nHowever, even in life, such as stagnant water in a jar, an unexpected event comes.\r\nA man with a scar on his face floated down.\r\n\r\n'As you can see, I've come to my senses. Letâ€™s out of here.\r\nI killed a man.'\r\n\r\nOrionis - a man commonly called Orion.\r\nA hunter from Atlantis.\r\n\r\n'I changed my mind a little. Let's get out of this island.\r\nI can't stand to see you die.'\r\n\r\nAfter an irresistible salvation,\r\nLokira, who opened her eyes, was already in the middle of the Aegean Sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the lord of the sanctuary proclaims to the nations of Greece.\r\n\r\n'Hound the fugitive.\r\nA successful country gains the supremacy of Greece.'>"
