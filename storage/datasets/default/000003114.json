	"description": "In order to survive in troubled times; in order to get revenge for loved ones; in order to claim justice for all 118 people who died undeservedly in the village. Lin WanYue took the residence registration of her younger brother Lin FeiXing to join the army, and was determined to kill the Huns all over the world.\n\nThe empress died at court, leaving the 16 year-old princess and the 8-year-old crown prince to rely upon each other for their lives. Several princes older than the crown prince were greedy for the throne, and the two were in a precarious position.>"
