	"description": "Dewitt, known as the Iron Marshal, is now on the verge of death. Just when the whole empire thought he was not going to survive, a small fox came down from the sky. The little fox was so powerful that it woke up the Marshal who had been in a coma for a month with one paw. If Wen Jin knew that the price of his paw was to become the Marshal’s fiance, he would refuse, because the legendary, ferocious Marshal was a well-controlled villain, only touching his fluffy body every day.\r\n\r\nWen Jin: You’ve had enough, I’m going bald!\r\n\r\nDewitt: Ten more minutes.\r\n\r\nWen Jin: Not a minute longer!\r\n\r\nDewitt: Then let me kiss you.\r\n\r\nStupid and lazy fox x black-faced Marshal meet in a world full of Zergs and war. Follow this intergalactic tale as they begin to trust and depend on one another.>"
