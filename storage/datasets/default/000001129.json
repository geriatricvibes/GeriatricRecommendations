	"description": "When he noticed, the protagonist who reincarnated as a baby was in a different world where magic normally exists. \nI was looking forward to using showy magic, but the attribute that was suitable for me was the earth attribute which was considered plain and unpopular in this world. The appearances of flame, ice and the like are more preferred since they have strong magic. In this world, the earth attribute is being treated unfairly because of plainness. \nThe protagonist who is the owner of such and unfortunate thing in this fantasy comedy aims to improve the status of earth magic.>"
