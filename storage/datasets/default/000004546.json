However, to ask the kid back, she had no alternative but to please him! He hated her to death for killing his beloved fiancée. Her mom hated her so much that she would rather kill her by plotting with other people. The kid died...and drug addiction came to her... If only she had never agreed the surrogacy! She wouldn't end up like this!>"
