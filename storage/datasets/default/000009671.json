	"description": "If video game currency is to exchange with real life currency, then it must have a powerful economic entity to guarantee the exchange rate. Furthermore this entity is none other than a country’s government. But why would a government guarantee the ability to exchange video game currency with real life currency?\r\n\r\nWar can also be fought with currency. Winning victory without firing a shot is a way to topple a country. A game where real money can be exchanged, a super money-making machine. Its name is <<Zero>>, and it is a financial explosion from head to tail.>"
