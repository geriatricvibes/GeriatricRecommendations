The day I was born.”\n\nWealth, I will seize all the money in the world.\n\nMonopoly, I will seize all the dungeons in the world.\n\nAt this time, while the world is still peaceful.\n\nNote: The first 50 chapters will be focused on Stock Market Exchange and other finance stuff. Dungeon and Fantasy related elements only appear later on and even then the business element is still prevalent.>"
