	"description": "As a hamster spirit that has been cultivated for thousands of years, An Yan's greatest wish was to succeed in his transformation.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he was just one step away from his transformation, he somehow crossed over to the interstellar age and became the only human who could maintain his normal form.\r\n\r\nIn response, An Yan just wanted to cry out in his heart, 'Who is the demon?'\r\n\r\nHowever, becoming a human being wasn’t that bad.\r\n\r\nHe was making potions, making a lot of money, abusing scum, and living a prosperous life.\r\n\r\nBut then, he turned back into a hamster!\r\n\r\nAn Yan: Squeak?\r\n\r\nCheng Yi: This hamster is so cute; it’s perfect for roasting.\r\n\r\nAn Yan: Squeak?!\r\n>"
