	"description": "Mo Shuyao, a parody mashup artist with millions of fans, got his account suspended overnight.\n \nJust because he turned Film Emperor Jiang into a parody mashup?\n \nHell, is this the twistedness of humanity or the ruin of morality?\n \nOn the set, Jiang Ran resonantly narrated the source material: “With a flick of the long whip in his hand, he wrapped it tightly around the other man, drawing him into his embrace... Not bad. This part is quite well-written.\n \nMo Shuyao instantly turned beet red, “Farke’u. Stop reading it already! Get lost! ”>"
