	"description": "I possessed the heroine in a reverse harem novel, where there was no such thing as skinship.\r\n\r\nBut was this an R19 novel?\r\n\r\nIn the original story, the heroine, a wizardess, helps various male characters with her magic and is loved by them.\r\n\r\nBut when I actually possessed the novel, in order to increase my mana, I had to consume the men’s energy.\r\n\r\nAlso, the men I helped cling to me to ‘eat’ them……?\r\n\r\nWasn’t this novel for all ages?>"
