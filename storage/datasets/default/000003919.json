	"description": "Theo Asper was a member of the mercenary guild, who had joined and been expelled from several adventurer parties.\n\nThe reason was simple, he was weak.\n\nWishing he was stronger, he summoned a devil to make his wish come true. But the moment he laid eyes on the devil he summoned…\n\n“I will grant you your wish, but in return I will take something important…”\n\n“Please m-marry me!”\n\n“…Ah?”\n\nHis thoughts of becoming stronger left his mind without a trace.\n\nThe devil granted his wish, and they became a couple.\n\n“Helvi… Can we hold hands?”\n\n“…Ah, yes. (You’re so cute! Ah… I want to assault you right here and now. As soon as we get home…)”\n\nThis is a slightly lewd (?) story of a timid boy and an assertive devil marrying and living happily, even as there is a great fuss being made around them.>"
