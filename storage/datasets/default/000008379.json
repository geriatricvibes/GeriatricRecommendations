	"description": "“It’s probably impossible for that washboard to become a familiar.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Go to h**l!”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘I want the class beauty to serve me,’ is probably a thought that went through anyone’s mind at least once.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut frankly, I wouldn’t recommend it. I, Souta Ashiya, a failure of a magician, turned my classmate, Chikage Fujiwara, into my familiar. She was the progeny of a famous magician, as well as the number one beauty amongst the freshmen whom everyone looks up to. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEh, you’re jealous? Seriously? Then, how about I hand her over to you? First off, she has far too high expectations of her master. Not to mention, she’s a sore loser and really rebellious, and above all, flat-chested. If you’re really fine with that, then she’s all yours… \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAh, that was just a joke! Spare me, Fujiwara!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n—This is a story of how a relationship of servitude evolves into that of mutual love (?)… apparently.\r\n\r\n >"
