	"description": "I possess a stepmother who meets a tragic end after abusing the young male lead.\n\nIs there a law that says stepmothers are always evil? Moreover, she is so beautiful!\n\nThere are too many hurdles in trying to be nice to the male lead for a comfortable and happy life.\n\n“Don’t worry, I will never accept Escal as my successor, Lena.”\n\n“What?”\n\nMy ignorant husband doesn’t know my intentions and treats his son badly.\n\n“Why don’t we send that kid to boarding school?”\n\n“But Escal is only six years old?!”\n\nEven his biological father wants to kick him out so badly.\n\n“I will listen to what you say, please don’t make him leave.”\n\nDon’t worry, my baby. This mother of yours will protect you.>"
