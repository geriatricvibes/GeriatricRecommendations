	"description": "After waking up from a car accident, not only was I alive, I had also gained a new ability. If I stare at someone or a photo for three seconds, I’m able to see whom and when they shall marry…\n\nThe 18th tier small-time actor Shen Chuchu knew that with this skill, her mother would never have to worry that she will starve to death again.\n\nShe would put down her roots on Weibo first, then open a matchmaking store on Taobao.*\n\n“Your husband is a close friend and you will be married in March next year. You will have a happy marriage.”\n\n“Your husband will appear at your company’s dessert store soon, so remember to keep a close watch every day.”\n\n……\n\n*Note: Weibo is a popular social media app in China with functions similar to Twitter. Taobao is basically the Chinese eBay/Amazon.>"
