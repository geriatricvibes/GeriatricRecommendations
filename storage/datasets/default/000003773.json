	"description": "There’s a type of ex-girlfriend’s who will accompany the growth of a boy into a mature man. She will be one who teaches the boy how to be the perfect boyfriend but in the end he will become someone else’s husband. Chang Chuansi is an ordinary girl but has an unusual boyfriend at school. She knows that her ending has an 80% chance of becoming like those ex-girlfriends.      \n\nAlmost everyone thinks that.\n\nChang Chuansi also thinks like that. She’s lying still like a salted fish waiting for the break up.\n\nIn the end, even before she reached the ‘breakup’ ending, the ‘social death’ plot line came first. \n\nHer parents, who weren’t optimistic about their relationship too and thought they would break up after graduation, came to their daughter’s graduation ceremony with photos of their friends’ and family relatives’ sons.\n\n“My good daughter, has anyone caught your eye? Your Aunt Qin’s nephew is two years older than you and is at the age that he would know how to cherish others. He also has a stable job… How about him? Your younger maternal aunt’s colleague’s younger brother is a 190 tall man. It’s just that he’s a bit dark…”\n\nChu Hao’s face darkened after walking over to meet her parents.\n\nChang Chuansi swallowed her saliva: Heaven wants me dead.>"
