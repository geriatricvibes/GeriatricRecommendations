	"description": "An eldest daughter was neither useful nor lovable in the eyes of parents who wanted a son.\n\nRadis, House Tilrod’s first-born daughter, lived all her life abiding by the ‘sacrifice’ that she was expected to do.\n\n“You are the Tilrod family’s eldest daughter. Isn’t it natural for you to do your best to support your brother since he’s the pillar of our family?”\n\n“You know, it’s only right for the eldest daughter to be the family’s breadwinner.”\n\n“Go hunt monsters in your brother’s stead. It’s so humiliating to have an unmarried daughter stay at home. But if you go on that subjugation expedition, I’ll allow you to stay here.”\n\nTo keep her place in her family, she tried anything and everything to win their love.\n\nShe believed that happiness would come to her someday if she continued to endure it all.\n\nHowever, she finally broke down after discovering her family’s betrayal when she came back home.\n\n“It was all a pipe dream. I should never have lived for my parents, for my brother… for my family. I should have just lived for myself!”\n\nAs she took her last breath, she thought it was finally over.\n\nBut Radis returned to the past at the age of sixteen.>"
