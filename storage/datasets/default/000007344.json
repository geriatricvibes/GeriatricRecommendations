	"description": "Her first love ended in ruin.\n\n[And so I often thought to myself, “I’d rather my husband just die already.]\n\nThat selfish, arrogant, boar-headed, and indulgent Prince was imprinted upon her memory. But now he’s acting strange….\n\nAlmost like he’s in love with Diana……\n\n“This is my second chance, Iandrus.”\n\n“I can’t lose you, Diana. It’ll end up just like my last life.”\n\n[Murderer.]\n\n[You end up dying, along with me, and even my child…… This is our future. So we shouldn’t get married, Iandrus. Don’t look so oblivious to it all.]\n\n“Without you, Diana……I might just die.”\n\nThe story of a woman who wants to avoid getting married, a man who desires their marriage, and the reason why they never should.>"
