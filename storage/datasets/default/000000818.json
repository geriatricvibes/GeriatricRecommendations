	"description": "Monica Everett, a genius magician, was extremely shy and terrible at speaking in public.\n\nTo that end, she worked hard and mastered the art of countless magic, which she could use without chanting. After being chosen as one of the Seven Sages at the tender age of fifteen as the “Silent Witch,” she lived a quiet life in the forest.\n\nHowever, two years have passed since then, and one day, Monica received an order.\n\nAnd it was to secretly protect the second prince to the academy undetected.\n\nIn order to protect the prince, Monica must infiltrate a glamorous school for the children of noble families.\n\n“I don’t wanna do this… I’m scared… Ugh… My stomach is aching…”\n\n…said the girl whimpering.>"
