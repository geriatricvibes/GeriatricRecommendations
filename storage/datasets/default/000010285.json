	"description": "Sagara Mizuki, who realized she had recollections of her previous life while wandering the border of life and death, woke up on a hospital bed. She was surprised that the environment surrounding her resembled the setting of [Seventh Heaven] a game which she had unwillingly played before. She was the perfect young lady who happened to be the rival of the disappointing heroine [Toujou Rin].\n\nHowever, if observed carefully, there were a lot of slight differences from the game. The perfect young lady named Mizuki became the perfect Prince known as the 'Beautiful Crossdresser' and her one-year older brother had turned five years older.\n\nWithout choosing the route of attacking the heroine, Mizuki begins to choose a proper life.\n\n“Eh? Huh? Why did it come to this?”\n\nWhat would be the future of the girl who had started to roll in the wrong direction of what she had wanted due to a slight mistake?>"
