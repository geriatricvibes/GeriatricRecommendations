	"description": "Real men have ambition.  The storm descends once more.  Even mortals cast of clay, you can shatter stars.\r\nAfter war waged by the hundred clans, war hero Sui Xingtuan* was framed as a traitor to the human clan.  He was purged and met with destruction.  The truth is buried in thousands of miles of sand sea under the surging yellow sands.\r\nSix years later, a slave merchant named Wen Qubing ascends to fame under the title of Skinflayer Wen.  He specialized in hunting down those remnants once associated with Sui Xingtuan.  However, behind this, there is a secret not known by anyone…\r\nThe former location of god sealing, the Shatter Star lost storehouse, the young lady of the dragon clan, and the demon god’s descent, when all these factors come together, the curtains will rise on a new legend.>"
