	"description": "‘Open your eyes, Eden. Please…! Please!’\r\n\r\nThere was a heated voice coming from far away. Have I really died? The more the torturous pleasure grew, the more my mind drifted away. Without realizing it, Hye-mi embraced the man’s back which was soaking with sweat.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHye-mi woke up as Eddert of the Klawe Empire.\r\nEveryone said she was Her Imperial Majesty, the Emperor.\r\nAnd beyond death, she was even reunited with her former lover, Walter.\r\n\r\n“You are destined to become Emperor of Klawe, Eddert.”>"
