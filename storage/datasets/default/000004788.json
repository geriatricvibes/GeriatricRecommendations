	"description": "Ilse was born to a poor Marquise family. To be more precise, she found herself reincarnated as the villainess of an otome game that she played in her previous lifetime.\n\nThat said, she isn’t quite bored enough to bully the heroine, so she just left her alone. Yet somehow, she still got entangled with her.\n\nIt seems the heroine wants to paint Ilse as the villainess, no matter what. Even though she’s the type of woman Ilse hates, she kept forcing herself into Ilse’s life. \n\nWhen she took her fiancé, Ilse’s patience finally ran out. 'If you insist on framing me as a bully, how about I really become one?'\n\nTogether with her childhood friend and attendant Joshua, Ilse decided to take on the heroine head-on.\n\nIt’s a heartwarming story about a cool beauty who ridicules and gives derisive retorts to the cute heroine.>"
