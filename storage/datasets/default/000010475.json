	"description": "One day, I found myself reincarnated as the friend of the female lead who is destined to die.\n\nThinking that I should tell the female lead everything, in the end, I decided to keep silent so as to not mess up the future.\n\nI became frustrated and ended up entering the forbidden forest to ‘secretly’ curse the male lead.\n\n“The male lead is a son of a b*tch!”\n\nHowever, not expecting anyone to hear it, for some reason, rumors have begun to spread that the male lead, Duke Vishwaltz, was a gay.\n\nMoreover, now he’s even going so far as to launch a full scale investigation to find the source of the false rumor…?\n\n“…I can’t help but to notice your voice.”\n\nAnyhow, I’m afraid my life is screwed.>"
