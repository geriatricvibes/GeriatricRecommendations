	"description": "Her cousin, Aries, was a baron’s daughter. However, her parents died in a carriage accident. Therefore, she was adopted by the Duke of Lark.\n\nHer father, Adley, loved Aries more than his own daughter—Sofia. Not to mention, Sofia’s fiance also favored Aries, who was more innocent and unconventional than the quiet and gloomy Sofia.\n\nFinally, Sofia’s fiance, Prince Wagner Vidal, annulled their engagement. Aries subsequently became Wagner’s new fiancee.\n\nAfterwards, Sofia, whose reputation as a noble lady had been tarnished, was proposed to by a viscount. The life that awaited Sofia was a miserable one—where she was abused every day. After she drew her last breath, she thought that the hell was finally over.\n\nHowever, time rewound to before Aries got adopted into her family.\n\nNot wanting to go through that miserable life again, Sofia struggled to change her destiny.>"
