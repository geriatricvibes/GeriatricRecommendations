	"description": "The meaning behind Lin Mu’s name is the forest at night.\r\n\r\nEvery time Lu Rong signs his name, he would sign it wrongly, calling himself “Little Deer.”\r\n\r\nVery long later, Lin Zhao signed with her fingers, smiling at the two people.\r\n\r\nShe signed, “The little deer is sleeping in the forest at night.”\r\n\r\nA special group of people, a special progress of life, and a special love.\r\n\r\nMy silence, and your affections.\r\n\r\nPlease, world, treat us a little more warmly.>"
