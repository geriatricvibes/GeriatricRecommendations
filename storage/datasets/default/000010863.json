	"description": "Lu Lin prided himself on being decent and conservative. He never thought that he would ever relate perfume with men or high school teachers.\n\nBut the new English teacher’s fingertips exude a faint scent of Bvlgari Aqva Pour Homme Marine.\n\nAnd it smells really good.\n\nWhen Pei Zhuo entered the staffroom, his eyes were instantly attracted to his fellow Language teacher he shared a class with.\n\nSerious, conservative, and unsmiling, even the shirt he wore was buttoned all the way up to the first button, like a restrained and withdrawn Chinese ink painting.\n\nHe felt an urge to lead him astray.>"
