	"description": "It is the turn of the century and humanity has ignorantly stepped into the starry space to lay themselves bare under the eyes of gods. The young man Luo Nan bears the sins of his forefathers. He walks out of a laboratory and is seen holding burning notes up high, his feet treading on the bones of gods. A myriad of living beings are formatted in writing. Universes are added and deleted in the star records.\r\n\r\nKnow now… All living beings be ready for me. Believe with certainty… For my mind is a universe.\r\n>"
