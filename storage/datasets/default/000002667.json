	"description": "Yamada Nagito, a university student living away from home, needing a cheap place to live, he finds out about a mysterious “House that grants wishes” on the market for a ridiculously low rent; he snaps up the house and starts living there. A few nights in he starts hearing strange creaking noises. Each and every night he’s assaulted by these torturous noises. The last straw is when he finds the number 7 carved into the wall, as if counting down to something. Yamada, having an interest in the occult seeks help from a website he frequently : “Ikaigabuchi”, which specialises in occult topics.>"
