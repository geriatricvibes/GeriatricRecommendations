	"description": "Takarai Sosei wanted to be like a normal high school student you could find anywhere.\n\nAs he balances a double life working a “job” he doesn’t wish for in secret while attending school, the top beauty in his class, Shiramori Asumi, somehow confesses to him and they began dating.\n\nSosei was over the moon, but due to his “job”, he couldn’t even go out on dates with her after school and during the weekends.\n\nOne day, at his “workplace”, he came across an eccentric classmate of his, Hitsujimoto Kuchina.\n\nIn actuality, Sosei worked as an assassin. Why would Kuchina appear here…\n\nThe intertwining love is both bitter and sweet, and so heart-wrenching. The “normal” they seek is so close yet so far.\n\nHe gains life while depriving others of it, and she erases life just by touching. This is their slightly dark romcom.>"
