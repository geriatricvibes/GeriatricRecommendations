	"description": "Three Days of Happiness is a novel by Sugaru Miaki, also known as Fafoo. It’s a rewritten version of the story originally posted to 2ch.\n\nThe premise of the story revolves around a shop where one can sell away the remaining years of their life, and the consequences of doing so.\n\n'I Say A Little Prayer' is a short related story which was posted along with the novel’s release. It spoils some things about the main story, but nothing major.>"
