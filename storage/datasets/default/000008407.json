	"description": "Ding! Welcome, He Who Knows Fate, to the Dimension Administrators Association!\r\n \r\nChen Heng had been feeling upset over the past few days, as he had suddenly gained an ability to see the future—the Absolute Future Sight.\r\n \r\nI’m going to die! I’m going to die! These words were no exaggeration. Chen Hen would truly die in a few years.\r\n \r\nFortunately, there was a Dimension Administrators Association that could support and help him.\r\n \r\nHowever, the moment he entered the association, a person called Magus of Flowers asked him to cross-dress and upload his photos. How do I deal with this nonsense?\r\n \r\nSo, is it too late to leave the chat group? Chen Heng felt that he had joined the wrong chat group.>"
