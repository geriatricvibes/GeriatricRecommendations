	"description": "Yoon-woo’s heart was somewhat like an unsold pottery.\n\nNot a single person liked Yoon-woo in his life.\n\nYoon-woo even put a price tag of 10 won on his heart, but no one even wanted him even then. Yoon-woo, who no one liked, couldn’t even like himself who didn’t even sell for the price of 10 won. One can only believe that one is worthwhile when one puts a price on oneself.\n\nBut then, a person came and offered money for Yoon-woo’s heart. She even offered more more than 10 won. \n\nYoon-woo finally had a reason to live himself, and she was the one who gave him that reason. \n\n“I think I know now.”\n\n“Why others don’t suffer from the anxiety that the ceiling will crush them when they are alone, and why others don’t worry about being hated with just a word when they meet someone…”>"
