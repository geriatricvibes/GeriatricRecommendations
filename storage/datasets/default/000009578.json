	"description": "Now, who can tell me, who is the man in front of me, wearing only a bath towel? He was walking t towards me slowly. My nerves twitched. I only saw this scene in the movies. I tried to conquer my panics to check out what was happening. But the man looks so great! He might just had a bath, the hairs were wet and long. Wow, his hairs were black and bright, prettier than mine. The best part of mine was my hairs, I always look at myself that way. But his were definitely better. His eyes were not very big, but was shining with maturity and confidence. Then, his figure…I can’t reject the charms.>"
