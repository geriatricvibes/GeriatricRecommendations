	"description": "I met a male protagonist who is exploding with descriptions of his work.\n\nThere are two options.\n\nNumber one, ignore and get killed like a dog.\n\nNumber 2 is a bit of a method, but it is provided with a dense touch.\n\nWhew, there’s nothing we can do. I don’t want to, but I didn’t want to die at all.\n\nI approached him crying while eating mustard.\n\n“I’m telling you in advance, don’t get me wrong.”\n\n“I’m not interested in you.” And I kissed him.\n\n“Take responsibility now.
