	"description": "It’s a place where you dream of being horribly murdered by Your Mother.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a dream, but it also happened in reality. To survive, I decided to make a different choice from my dream.\r\n\r\nThe only way to survive is to meet the Empress, but the only one that I encountered was my half-brother, the Crown Prince, Rudan. When I thought I was wrong, he reached out to me…\r\n\r\n“Can I stay here?”\r\n\r\n“This is your room now.”\r\n\r\nI just cried because I was hungry, but everyone was so kind to me.>"
