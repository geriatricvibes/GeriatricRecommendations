	"description": "As the only male in the Lu family, Lu Shui received an order from the elders of the clan today: go to the Mu family to divorce. I heard that Mu Jiatian’s beautiful girl lost her cultivation overnight and turned into a waste, which caused the Lu family’s elders to be very dissatisfied. The ordinary land and water did not refuse. When Lu Shui came to Mu's house and saw his fiancee, he was stunned. It turned out that this fierce and discordant wife in the previous life was also reborn.\r\n>"
