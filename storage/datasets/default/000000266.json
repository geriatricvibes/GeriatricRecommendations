	"description": "Chen Chuan woke up to find himself holding 70 billion yuan in a rental house, and this marked the start of his wonderful life. \r\n\r\nHe went from being a miserable office worker to a billionaire, yet this was just the beginning. Each week, he was rewarded with a large package that consisted of everything: a five-star hotel, an office building, a manor, an exclusive supercar, a calligraphy work, a technology industrial park, an aerospace project, thousands of heavy trucks, a brilliant football team, a landfill, an oasis and romance… \r\n\r\nChen Chuan thought to himself, ‘I just want to get rich and lead a peaceful life. I don’t want to be popular.’ \r\n\r\n>"
