	"description": "Yuuya Toba, a hardworking son of a distinguished family, and Mizuki Fushimi, a girl that seems like an untouchable goddess on the outside, but is actually a friendly person. These two have been living together since they entered high school, and are so close that others refer to them as a married couple. \r\nThey’re too close to hold hands, and too embarrassed to try romance… Huh?!\r\n\r\n“‘Married couple’, you might call it, but ‘more than friends but less than lovers’? Not a chance!”\r\n\r\nThis is the story of two amateurs at love… the story of a couple that doesn’t think they’re a couple making progress in their relationship!\r\n>"
