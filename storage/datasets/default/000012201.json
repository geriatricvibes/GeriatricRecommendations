	"description": "Your Highness (Princess), please give us your advise.\n\nShe is the 23rd century top miracle doctor, but harmed by the person she trusted the most overnight.\n\nOpening her eyes once again, her soul actually possessed the body of a small baby from a different world.\n\nA pair of bewitching, violet-coloured eyes and a head of violet-coloured hair.\n\n15 years later, a powerful and talented out-of-the-world beauty emerged.\n\nCountless men were attracted and competed to get her.\n\nMorever, there was also an overbearing, black-bellied man persistently bothering her, vowing to imprison her by his side.\n\n“Woman, you are mine.”\n\nShe threw an icy glance at him, “Just you? Are you worthy?”\n\nShe swore not to easily trust anyone anymore, no one can walk into her heart anymore.\n\nWhen the cold and strict black-bellied Emperor threw away his integrity to chase after the ruthless woman, and they butted head with each other strongly in every turn, what kind of sparks will be created between them?>"
