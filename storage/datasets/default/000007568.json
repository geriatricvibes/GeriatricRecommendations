	"description": "Mo Shang Jun, a rare female commander of the Reconnaissance Battalion, was gorgeous as a pinup vase.\n\nRumour has it: this highness has capricious moods, cunning ways, and is the walking definition of the word shameless!\n\nYan Tian Xing, the mysterious captain of the Yama Team in the Special Forces was a devil—he's wicked hot.\n\nRumour has it: this young master has a cruel temperament, ruthless ways, and is the walking definition of the word tyrant!\n\nIn reality however.\n\nThe both of them are first-class 'lookist's!\n\nnote: 'lookist' refers to someone who assumes one’s character based on physical appearance or looks only, however the word used in the raws is 颜控 which is closer to the definition of 'appearance-complex' meaning the person is very taken by appearance of others before anything else and favours good-looking people.>"
