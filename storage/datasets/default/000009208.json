	"description": "I suddenly hit the jackpot (is it really?) that lands right in front of me. It changes me, Archer Teil, a normal farm boy, into the twelfth demon king of the demon world that governs over hundreds of subjects that has to harass the hero and to endure people’s curses as if it’s an everyday life routine.\n\n... The reason how I came to be the demon king (an occupation that everyone will say ewww) isn’t that I have royal bloodline running in my veins or that I have super badass explosive powers ... No no, I got the job because the late demon king picked my name from the lottery!?\n\nOh, my Goddess!! Someone, please tell me, why do these things have to happen to me?!>"
