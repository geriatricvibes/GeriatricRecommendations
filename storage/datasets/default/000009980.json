	"description": "Do you see that person with hair loss because they’re stuck possessing a new body?\n\nIt’s me.\n\nA civil servant, I possessed the minor villain who died after being exploited.\n\nTo make matters worse, while I was living and avoiding the main characters, the male lead set my house on fire.\n\nI got a job as a government official in the lower half of the Imperial city to cover my collapsed family’s insurance…\n\n“Miss Blaine, I’m sorry but it will be difficult for me to accept your resignation letter.”\n\n“Wh-what? Why!”\n\n“You’ve been promoted to become His Majesty’s exclusive secretary.”\n\nThis is crazy, I’ve become the villain’s secretary.\n\n***\n\n“Working in the Imperial city is a dream job, and among them, working as my secretary is what everyone desires.”\n\nUm, well, that’s true.\n\n“So why is my secretary so impatient to resign?”\n\nWhy, because if I’m with you, my life will diminish more each minute and if I get unlucky, I’ll die!\n\n“I need a secretary like you. Say what you want, but it’ll be impossible.”\n\nThe Emperor grinned, and I blurted out immediately.\n\n“I don’t like this.”>"
