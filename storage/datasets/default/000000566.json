	"description": "A third-year high school boy lost his life due to a disease. When he opened his eyes again, he had turned into a baby.\n\nThe Third Prince, whose existence was hidden, could neither talk nor laugh, and was considered a failure. Add in an overprotective servant and a dragon who did things out of his own convenience.\n\nContinuing on living even with repeated misunderstandings. Heartwarming, alternate world life.>"
