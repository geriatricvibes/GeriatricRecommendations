	"description": "The ending of fairy tales is usually a happy ending for the hero and heroine. As for the supporting characters, who will care about their happiness? They turn dark the next day after having such a bad thought. They want to revolt, and they don’t want to be the main couple’s stepping stone to their 'true love' again. Oh my god! What about the plot? What kind of story will play out with a character like this? Can it still run smoothly? The hero and heroine are going to be crippled by the supporting character!!!! Well, there’s actually a project to save the plot from it. By nipping the bud of all evil thoughts from them, they let the hero and heroine live together in happiness. The title of this project is 'To Save the Supporting Character.' All executors must dutifully do their work, and as for the means to achieve it, Oh, no! That’s not worth mentioning.\n \nNo matter whether it is a white cat or a black cat, if that cat can catch a mouse, then it is a good cat.>"
