	"description": "“Is this world the same as the game?” My name is Yura, 20-years-old, and I was abducted and recalled the memories of my previous life.\n\nMoreover, I was suspected of being a witch when I was abducted, but didn’t this game end with the witch destroying the country?!\n\nI was uneasy about being suspected of being the last boss, but my ability to make tea was awakened before my powers as a witch.\n\nIn that case, I started a tearoom in the chivalric order’s castle they were letting me stay at.\n\nI’ll do my best making tea, subjugating monsters, and persuading monsters until the kingdom is saved!\n\n※ The tearoom starts business starting in the second volume.>"
