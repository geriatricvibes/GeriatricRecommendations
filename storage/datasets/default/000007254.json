	"description": "Her parents were murdered.\r\nThat day, an unidentified man was standing in her room.\r\nIvan Yelkah.\r\n\r\n“Have you woken up?”\r\n“You…. are you imprisoned here?”\r\n\r\nEven in the land where she was born, he was a stranger.\r\nAn existence that cannot be mixed anywhere and is not welcomed by anyone.\r\nThe only way out of this pain was death.\r\n\r\n“I saved you, so I will do my best to protect you.”\r\n“W-hy do you want me to live?”\r\n“Because I need you, Lia.”\r\n\r\nAs he says, is Ivan a CIA agent?\r\nOr, was he a pervert stalker who was constantly tormenting me?\r\nWhoever he was, I had to get out of here.\r\n\r\n“Lia, are you trying to run away?”\r\n“H-how did you know….?”\r\n\r\nWhile Lia was confused, Ivan’s hand pulled her pants.\r\n\r\n“Last time, you masturbated by yourself, didn’t you? This time, I will make you happy.”\r\n“I-I don’t need it, stop…..!”\r\n\r\nSoon her thin, pure white thighs were exposed.\r\n\r\n“Do you still want to run away? It’s better to give up.”\r\n\r\nIvan added in a fresh voice. Soon the smile disappeared from his face.\r\n\r\n“I can find you, Lia, wherever you hide. It’s like fate. We can see each other everywhere. It sounds like nonsense, but you’ll soon realize that too.”\r\n“W-what do you want to say?”\r\n“If you want to know if this is bullshit or the truth, run away again.”>"
