	"description": "“I am the heroine of an otome game, so is it wrong to like the villainess?”\n\nCorporate s*ave OL, Oohashi Rei, reincarnated as the heroine Rei Taylor in the world of the otome game 「Revolution」.\n\nHer preference isn’t the capturable princes, it’s the villainess, Claire François.\n\nShe merrily accepts Claire’s dislike.\n\nWith the protagonist’s involvement, it’s the beginning of a unique romcom.\n\nTo make it worse, Rei’s love became directed at the villainess, what does Claire’s future hold?\n\nIt’s my second series with a screwball villainess.\n\nA little different from ordinary… I hope you can enjoy the villainess who’s just a little different.>"
