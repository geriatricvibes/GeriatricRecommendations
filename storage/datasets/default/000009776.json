	"description": "As a walking bug, Bai Cu always gave a friendly hand towards the sinister supporting characters and villains. They’d be trembling in the corner. The hostess said that she’d be our friends, but she changed her mind in the blink of an eye. \r\n\r\nBai Cu: Who said I’d be your friend?\r\n\r\nThe adonis passed by with a faint smile on his face. \r\n\r\n“I heard you guys want to be friends with her?”\r\n\r\nA cold glint reflected over the knife he was spinning on his fingertips.\r\n\r\nEveryone: No, we don’t want to be. \r\n\r\nShe’s mine, only mine. No one can steal her away from me. \r\n>"
