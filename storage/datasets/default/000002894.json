	"description": "To survive in the world he transmigrated into, Model Citizen Gu Xizhou became a demonic cultivator.\n\nBut then… but then he transmigrated back.\n\nThe returned Gu Xizhou was furious. The student that had sacrificed his body to reincarnate him had used a demonic array meant for summoning evil spirits. He, Gu Xizhou, had been a law-abiding citizen who upheld the core socialist values prior to transmigration, the very picture of a model citizen. So how had he become a heinous malicious spirit since his return from transmigration?!>"
