	"description": "Aika and Manaka are both twin sisters.\n\nThe two were always together wherever they go, whatever they do. This is a relationship between two people. That will never change… or so they believed.\n\nOne such day, there was a “difference” that occurred between the two. I wonder when this all happened. That “difference” was the sole trigger that led to the distorted start of a story.>"
