	"description": "“It’s my principle to never let go of the people I once reached out my hand to.”\n\nReincarnated again and again for failing to reach his life span, the protagonist’s soul finally lost its ability to become human in his next life. Finding it amusing, God decided to send him instead to a world where magic and demi-humans exist, and turns him into a Demon God — a legendary, fearful existence among the residents of that world.>"
