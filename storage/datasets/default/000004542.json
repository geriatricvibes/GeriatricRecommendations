	"description": "With no message from her father, a doctor whose work often took him far from home, in months, Yukimura, a young girl, disguised herself as a man and headed for Kyoto in search of him. Attracting the attention of ronins, she tried to hide, but witnessed a horrifying sight: the ronins were brutally murdered by a vampire-like creature. In a startling turn of events, members of the Shinsengumi arrived to kill the creature. This group of men tied her up and took her back to their headquarters, unsure of whether to let her live or silence her permanently.\r\n\r\nAfter learning the name of her father, the Shinsengumi decided to keep her safe, as they too had been searching for him…\r\n\r\nWhat? Yukimura turned out to be a demon with the purest blue blood? No wonder she could heal so quickly after getting hurt…\r\n\r\nWhat was the secret of the Shinsengumi?…>"
