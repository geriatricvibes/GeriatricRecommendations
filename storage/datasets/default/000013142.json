	"description": "Rena, a girl who was transferred to another world as a Hero, finally brought down the demon lord. However, the kingdom feared the enormous power she possessed and not only snatched away her equipment, but also imprisoned her in order execute her later. There, Rena received advice from the similarly imprisoned demon Dejiizu and awakened her true ability – ”Domination.” That is a power where one could take control over a target by sending in magic power by means of a kiss, and manipulate them freely. She, for starters, took control over the princess who had betrayed her.>"
