	"description": "R*ped! R*ped!\n\nThe next CEO of Rong Hua corporation was r*ped! He was r*ped by an unknown man at the construction site with his hands tied and blindfolded! Rong Baiwen swore he would make that person’s life a living hell!\n\nThe man who r*ped him turned out to be one of the construction workers on the construction site! He hired a group of gangsters to gang r*pe that man for revenge, but the gangsters were too weak and ended up getting beaten up. \n\nEven when he’s in a simple shed at the construction site, kneeling on a crude bed made of wooden planks, wiggling his snow-white ass to meet the man’s thrusting and couldn’t stop moaning and screaming, he would never admit that he’s attracted to a migrant worker.\n\n“You’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you pervert!” \n\n“Baby, you’re my exquisite sheep!”>"
