	"description": "The Hero Punishment, the name of the harshest sentence.  \n\nOr at least, as so stipulated by the Union Executive Office.\n\nSometimes referred to as the worst punishment.\n\nHeroes are at the forefront of the fight against the Demon King Phenomena, even death cannot redeem them, they must continue fighting. \n\nThere is no length for this punishment. \n\nEven if you were to keep fighting for a hundred years, you will not be forgiven.\n\nThe one only exception set – amnesty when the Demon Kings are eradicated.\n\n–And to eradicate all Demon Kings is nothing more than a fantasy.>"
