	"description": "Helian Chacha never expected that things could go even worse when she thought the worst had already happen...\r\nShe transmigrated, which was quite popular these days, but unfortunately she became a fake eunuch, who was actually a girl!\r\nIt seemed everyone in the royal palace wanted her dead.\r\nShe got poisoned and was forced to assassinate the Emperor. What should she do?\r\nThe emperor knew she wanted to kill him, but he just played dumb and watched her fail once and again, but she knew nothing about it and had to keep trying...\r\nOh my goodness, it was so hard for Helian Chacha to survive. Good luck with her...>"
