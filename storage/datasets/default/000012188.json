	"description": "If life could start over, she would never do such a s*upid thing as “justify bravely” again.\n\nSince saving this dead little demon on the road at the age of seven, her life has fallen into a miserable situation.\n\nFrom her mother, down to the soft-footed junior brothers in the martial arts hall, are all coaxed to be submissive by this dead little demon who looks like a beautiful flower boy.\n\nAs everyone knows, he’s just using his appearance to win love and sympathy. In fact, he is an ungrateful highest-ranking bastard who will frame her!\n\nSince she was a child, she didn’t know how many suffocating losses she had suffered from him.\n\nSince she can’t afford to provoke him then she can always avoid him, right?\n\nHowever, he just won’t go away, wandering around her with his old love and still wickedly ruined her love affair repeatedly!\n\nThis bastard! She hates him the most! He can just go to hell──\n\nHorses! Why did he become a victim of a car explosion?\n\nAlthough she told him to go to hell before, if he really dares to die, she… she will definitely… definitely break down…>"
