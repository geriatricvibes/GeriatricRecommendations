	"description": "A saint is summoned from another world for the purpose of giving birth to a holy knight.\n\nLegria, a saint, is appointed as the Crown Princess.\n\nThen, four men approached Legria.\n\n“If you’re going to run away, make sure to hide well. If I catch you, I’ll crush your ankles and lock you up so you can never escape my side.”\n\n– Rahik Barakiel Beligreum, the Crown Prince of Beligreum.\n\n“Pretty girl, you have to make a fuss. Let the entire world know.”\n\n– Ewha Sinuel Mosgrato, the leader of the assassination gang ‘Queze’ that control the dark district.\n\n“Do you have any idea how I feel when I look at you? You stole her body.”\n\n– Fyodor Ian Sevirake, the Commander of the Holy Knights.\n\n“I don’t mind if you limp when you run around. It’s good enough for me. All I have to do is match your every step.”\n\n– Bikan, the highest warrior of the ‘Tuak’ tribe of the Grassland Alliance.\n\nIn their eyes, I was a pet, a replacement for a dead prospective wife, a nuisance, or simply entertainment.\n\nBut, I could only be me.\n\nFrom the beginning, I could only be myself.>"
