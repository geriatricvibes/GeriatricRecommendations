	"description": "Wang Bo was fed up with his job being a programmer, especially because of all of the nights he was working overtime without pay. His boss had given him a mysterious game to beta test in his free time, which had granted him possession of unclaimed territory in New Zealand with which to improve to his desires. After a certain event in his company, he ended up quitting his job. His lack of goals and curiosity eventually led him to buy a ticket to New Zealand, in order to see if the unclaimed territory given to him in the game was actually real. Watch, as he develops this beautiful, fertile stretch of land into prosperity, by building villages, farms, schools, hospitals and more.>"
