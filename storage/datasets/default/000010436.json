	"description": "A pin-up were-dog lives at my house. A sucking, biting, and licking bastard. That bastard is suspicious. I, Ji-On, had just gotten off work, tear-soaked from my lover's betrayal, when I picked up a puppy from a car accident. The next morning, I woke up in the arms of a sleeping, mega-sexy man! He changes into a were-dog when I kiss him! Now in a master and pet relationship, a fierce war of status and power, filled with twists and turns has started. Heart attack from cuteness overload when a puppy, heart attack from handsomeness when a human! Awww, a multifaceted romance with a sexy, instinct-driven male. Come have a heartthrob, come have two!♥ >"
