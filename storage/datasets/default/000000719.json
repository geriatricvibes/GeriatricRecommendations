	"description": "Nie AnAn woke up one day and realized that she had transmigrated as the villain’s adoptive sister.\n\nIn the novel, the villain conquered left and right, and his always woe-is-me younger sister was always cleaning up after him. The two of them were rightfully the grim reapers in the book.\n\nThe very next day after her transmigration, the soft and delicious Nie AnAn passed out from seeing blood.  \n\nAnd so —\n\nThe shivering competitors noticed that their nemesis’s sister had turned to a delicious treat — and wanted to protect her;\n\nThe original male lead noticed that young Miss Nie, who had been chasing after him this entire time, wouldn’t even give him the time of day anymore — and felt unbalanced;\n\nYoung Master Nie was very happy that his parents had two kids back then– she was so cute;\n\nA certain cold blooded and violent villain had been going home earlier and earlier, and the way he talked was becoming gentler and gentler.\n\nVillain Brother: AnAn, come over. Let me try some of it.\n\nNie AnAn: Hold on, gege. It’s not ready yet.>"
