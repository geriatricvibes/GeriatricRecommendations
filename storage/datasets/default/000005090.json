	"description": "Lin HaoMiao fell in love with Wen Wen at first sight after seeing him on the street. Knowing full well that the other party already had a boyfriend, he still couldn’t help himself from wanting him.\r\n\r\nIn order to get closer to Wen Wen, Lin HaoMiao stalked, followed, spied and went through his garbage; he did everything. Until one day, they became trapped in a game world, and although Wen Wen’s boyfriend was there, at least they had something more in common, so Lin HaoMiao felt twistedly happy.\r\n\r\nThen he saw it with his own eyes – Wen Wen stabbed his boyfriend to a bloody pulp.\r\n\r\nA perverted and demented gong versus a neurotic and yandere shou. Both have twisted personalities and their three views are not very positive.>"
