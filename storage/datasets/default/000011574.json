	"description": "Having served in the Northeast Field Army, Ye Tianming, once called an “extremely dangerous person”, was chosen for the Blue Sword Special Forces to his surprise. He’s crafty, cocky, prideful, yet possesses talent and planning above others. He’s walked on the front line, leading his teammates in Blue Sword to erase the invasion attempt by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; he chose elites and dealt a huge blow to the opponent in a military exercise; he is neither good nor evil, and openly defied orders to save his teammates; he went overseas, and entered terrible trouble in order to save his fellow citizens… Desert breakthrough, wilderness sniping, escape through Gobi, hunting overseas…\n\nAfter a series of tests through blood and flames, the fresh troops led by Ye Tianming grew up quickly, and became an iron-willed lion. They have the speed of cougars, the power of lions, the craftiness of foxes, and the stealth of a snake. In front of evil, they have an aura fill of murderous intent; in front of justice, they seem to show the hot blooded spirit of special forces. They have no unit designation, no honor, and even no gravestones, in the age of peace, they composed a soul-stirring song of generosity!>"
