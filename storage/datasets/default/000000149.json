	"description": "By the time I realized it, I had reincarnated into another world.\n\nI kept sleeping, and at some point I became a Demon Lord.\n\nEven though I never wished for it.\n\nBut for me to not have to work, this world is the best. It must be true that good things happen to good people.\n\nThe flavor of Sloth is as sweet as honey. Glory, diligence, virtue, or honor. I have no interest in anything like that.\n\nWhat’s there to hide? The Lazy king is… none other than me.>"
