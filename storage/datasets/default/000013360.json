The entire planet was stunned.\n\nEveryone knew what kind of prestigious existence he was: The Imperial Marshal’s son, the empire’s youngest Major General, the planet’s most handsome ger, the planet’s goddess in the eyes of the male population……\n\nHowever, he unexpectedly got matched to an unknown nobody: A 30-year-old poor teacher with nothing.\n\nEveryone was not calm anymore.\n\nRegarding this, a certain Ji person’s slender brows twitched indistinctly. He had just transmigrated over and they already gave him a bride. This world was really way too good.\n\nOne cold, one indifferent, who exactly fell first.>"
