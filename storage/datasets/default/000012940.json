	"description": "Othily is the youngest child of the Chevincourt Ducal House. A textbook pampered noble brat who thought the entire world revolves around her. However, all of these delusions were destroyed at her first social banquet when everyone else refused her company. The reason was the words of another ducal lady called Louise Michelin who exposed her selfish action in the higher social circle.\r\n\r\n10 years of attempts to change and extinguish her infamy. The hatred still remained, so Miss Othily aims to become a commoner instead.>"
