	"description": "I, Yukito Kokonoe, have bad luck with women. I’ve always been in trouble, my mother hates me, my sister dislikes me, my childhood friend who I thought I’m in love with rejects me before I confess my feelings to her, and then she tells me a lie while I’m still heartbroken. As a result, I found myself completely emotionally broken, and it was too late to do anything about it, but…\n\n“It’s my fault …… everything is my—-”\n\n“I’m sorry, Yuki!　I’m not like that—-”\n\nFor some reason, I think the women who traumatized me are glancing at me. ……\n\nThis is a love comedy about a boy who has been hurt too much to accept kindness and the women who have hurt him, a love comedy of misunderstandings that doesn’t start at all, starting when it’s too late!>"
