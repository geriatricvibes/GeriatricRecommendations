She knows she will enter the death route if she does not lose her virginity and somehow has to decide which capture target she has to do ecchi things with; though the guard, Calfan, tries to instruct her how to sneak around to do nightly activities. Sweet Lovey-Dovey story.\n\nPart 2: From 5 years old, Flora, the heroine of an otome game, knew that the days of embarrassment await. She thought that in order to get away somehow, she must acquire the power to fight back against the embarrassing ikemen. It’s a rom-com with a ruthless S butler.>"
