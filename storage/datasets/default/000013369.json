	"description": "Gu Bai carried his drawing board and moved into an incredible apartment building.\n\nHe found that the Queen of Toutiao lived on his left, and the veteran celebrity lived on his right. He went out to take an elevator, a supermodel stood on his left, and a gold lawyer on his right.\n\nAcross the door lives a financial crocodile who is often scanned in financial magazines.\n\nMany years later, the reporter of S City Daily had the honor to interview Mr. Gu Bai, the famous muralist and lover of the financial crocodile Si Yiming.\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Gu, what is your biggest gain from this experience of freely falling in love and getting married with Si Dong?”\n\nGu Bai thought for a while, and replied, “Save the world.”>"
