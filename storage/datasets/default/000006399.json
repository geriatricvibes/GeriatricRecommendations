	"description": "After class placements were decided, the school’s two infamous ‘problem youths’ not only shared the same class, but the same desk.\n\nThey’re clearly good at studies, but pretend to be slackers. Fakers from head to toe who just keep walking farther down the path of their performance.\n\nHeard through the grapevine about the two big brothers who always fight over the last place in class.\n\nBasically, this is a serious comedy. About the little matters of growing up.>"
