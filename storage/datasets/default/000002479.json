	"description": "She stepped into a stranger’s room as the result of a conspiracy in her wedding, and her world collapsed after her lover and her little sister both betrayed her. \r\n\r\nShe was in excruciating pain and decided to give birth to the child whose father was unknown. \r\n\r\nYears later, the most powerful and wealthy man in S City, Bai Yansen, passed her a medical certificate and asked her calmly, “How are you going to be responsible?” \r\n\r\nShe looked at the certificate in her hand and fell into a moment of silence. \r\n\r\n“How do you want me to be responsible?” she asked. \r\n\r\nHe said in all seriousness, “Use the second half of your life to compensate for the first half of my life.” \r\n\r\nShe rolled her eyes and pulled over Little Milk Bun. “Are you sure?” \r\n\r\nHe looked at Little Milk Bun and said, “An experienced wife plus an heir; it is a good deal.” \r\n\r\n>"
