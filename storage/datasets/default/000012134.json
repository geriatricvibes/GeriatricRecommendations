	"description": "In elementary school, Xue Youka had an urological surgery, leading to him being forced to wear his cousin sister’s dress all summer as a boy… \n\nA young master who lived in his maternal grandpa’s residence in the countryside, and led a pampered life saw him in his girly attire…\n\nFor the sake of cheating him out of spicy sticks and ice creams, Xue Youka used his cousin sister’s name and played house with him, becoming his little girlfriend. The other party even promised to marry him in the future. \n\nXue Youka bit the ice cream and nodded happily: “Brother, this is delicious! Buy me another one?” \n\nWhen they parted, they were extremely reluctant. Xue Youka thought that his spicy sticks were gone. The eldest young master was also sad because he wanted to see his lovely girlfriend next winter vacation. \n\nYears later, the eldest young master, who still missed his little girlfriend, met a junior who looked like his little girlfriend who had moved back then, on the university campus.\n\nEldest Young Master: Huh? ? ?>"
