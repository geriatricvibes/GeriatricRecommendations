And was honored with the name 'Old Buddha' in her old age. \r\n\r\nShe donated her billions of her fortune after her death. Opening her eyes again she was bound by the system, as long as she accumulated the points, it would help her to go back in time and make up for her previous regrets. \r\nSince then Tang Lihua threads through various small worlds, becoming the grandmother of one of the cannon fodder supporting characters. \r\n\r\nAnd whoever has heard of Tang Lihua's name knows that this Old Buddha was the most protective lady.\r\n>"
