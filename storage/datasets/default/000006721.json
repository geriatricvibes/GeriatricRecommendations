	"description": "Shu Ning read a CEO novel. In it, there was a beautiful and tragic villain. He was clearly the true young master of a wealthy family, but he was switched at birth and became a delinquent. Later, he returned to the wealthy family to go against the fake young master, fought for his fiancée, and finally fell from the top of a building and died.\n\nAfter his death, the fake young master inherited his money and his fiancée, his career and his love.\n\nShu Ning resentfully tore up the novel and transmigrated into the book that very night.\n\nThe little villain shook his legs, cursed, had horrible grades, dyed his hair yellow, didn’t have a single good point.\n\nShu Ning's eyes twitched: Before sending him back to the Wei family, let's make some changes. Otherwise, he’ll be rejected by the Wei family again.\n\nAfter being reformed by Shu Ning.\n\nThe little villain didn't shake his legs, stopped swearing, and cut his crazy, scene-style hair. He was as beautiful as a fairy and took first place in the entire grade.\n\nDaddy Shu Ning shed tears of relief: Our baby is so good. He’ll definitely be able to get rid of that fake young master!\n\nBut isn't baby a little too good?\n\nHe casually created a piece of software and sold it for hundreds of thousands.\n\nHe casually bought some stocks and made millions.\n\nBefore his wealthy family had even found him, he had become wealthy all on his own.\n\nEvery time he earned some money, he would offer it up to Shu Ning, buying him this and that, even buying him a villa!\n\nShu Ning (drooling): This damn villa, quickly take it away, don't tempt me!\n\nYin Mingzheng thought that he was trash of unknown origin, someone that no one cared about. He thought that he was someone who should have perished long ago.\n\nUntil that day, when he met the only light in his life.\n\nSo he clung onto the light tightly, refusing to let go.\n\nHis light said: You have to improve yourself.\n\nSo Yin Mingzheng worked hard to become better and stronger. He wanted to protect his only light. Because his light was the sole meaning of his existence.\n>"
