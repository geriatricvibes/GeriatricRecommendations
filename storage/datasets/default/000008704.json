	"description": "I thought I was dying, but when I woke up, I became Countess Yurina Frione. Having received all her memories, I realized that Yuriana’s husband, Armin had been trying to kill her. In the six years Yuriana fell in a coma, her husband had an affair with another woman and had a child. He became Frione’s successor.\n\n“Are you okay now, Fairy? I heard that you were sick!”\n\n“Well, that’s why.”\n\n“When I came, you were sleeping all the time!”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Who are you and why are you in my room?”\n\n“Ah … I’m Ramios Frione!”\n\nRealizing that the child was the son of Armin, I was angry for a moment.\n\n“I wish the Fairy was my mother.”\n\nWhy would he say that? Why do you say this? Why do you like me?>"
