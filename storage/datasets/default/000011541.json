	"description": "I was described as the short-lived childhood friend who turned the male lead into a tyrant in the novel.\n\nI died on his behalf, as the novel said.\n\nI thought I could now return to my original world.\n\n…But why am I back to the age of ten?\n\nIs there something wrong with the original story?\n\nI can’t help it! I thought I would succeed this time and go back to reality…\n\nThis tyrant dream is too realistic to be true!\n\n“I don’t care about the throne.”\n\n“What?”\n\nWhat is it? Did I say this before my regression?\n\n“What are you talking about? Becoming emperor…”\n\nYou should meet the heroine and the original story should go on. That way I can go back!\n\n“Viche.”\n\nJade was calling me somewhere with a low voice.\n\n“I can’t let you go… for whatever reason.”\n\nThere was a soft smile behind Jade’s bleak eyes.\n\n…I think he knows something.>"
