	"description": "'You'd better not dream of being acknowledged as my wife. I would never have a successor with the daughter of Balazit.' \r\n\r\n\r\nHearing that, Nadia almost said, 'I feel the same way.' \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, Marquis. I hope you keep your words.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n'You said you had no intention of sharing the bed with me.'\r\n\r\n“...”\r\n\r\n'So for the sake of a successor, I suggest that you had no choice but to bring in a concubine...' \r\n\r\n\r\nCrack.\r\n\r\nNadia's head turned at the sound of something cracking. \r\n\r\nThen, a crack is seen in a corner of the table where her husband was. \r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, why was that table breaking all of a sudden?\r\n>"
