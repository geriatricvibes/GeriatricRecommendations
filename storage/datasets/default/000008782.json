	"description": "I became the villainess that was killed because she was jealous of the heroine. The good thing was that the story hadn’t started yet, but there was still a problem. “I told you, I don’t do one night stands.” I took away the hero’s first time. Everyone must know that getting together with the hero = a death flag. I don’t remember much and I want to end it here but he insisted.\n\n“Let’s do it again.”\n\n“What? Er… do what again?”\n\n“Everything that you don’t remember.”\n\n“You’re joking, right? How can we do that again?”>"
