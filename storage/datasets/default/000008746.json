	"description": "Hikaru Sekiya gets mixed up in some senseless trouble, and before he knows it he’s hurled into a world he couldn’t imagine.\n\nThat world was just slightly different from his own.\n\nBut that slight difference was incredibly frustrating. And just when he gets used to daily life in that slightly different world…\n\nA tiny sci-fi, but a bittersweet one.>"
