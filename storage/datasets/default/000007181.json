	"description": "When I opened my eyes in the body of an extra.\r\n\r\nI was in Ian’s room. Ian, who is currently the commander of the Holy Knights, will become an iron-blooded Emperor in the future.\r\n\r\nI was misunderstood as to having spent the night with Ian after being spotted by many knights, thus becoming an obstacle for him.\r\n\r\nI pretended to be a saint to save my life and make my escape… Was the act too realistic?\r\n\r\nHe suddenly proposed a one-year marriage.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“Let’s get married.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“So you’re going to make me out as someone who will mess around with anyone, not just as someone who lost their virginity?”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about? How could I dare touch you?”\r\n\r\nIan Esteban, who had the greatest power and beauty of all time, said with a dazzling smile.\r\n\r\n“My wife.”\r\n\r\nBut I don’t like this scary husband!>"
