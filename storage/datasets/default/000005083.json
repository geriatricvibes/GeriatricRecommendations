	"description": "Lu Shang picked up a dirty teenager while discussing work at a bar. It was merely happenstance, but memories from ten years ago resurfaced when he saw the gunshot scars on the teenager’s back.\r\n\r\nLu Shang asked him, “What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Xiao Li… My surname is Li, so they all called me Xiao Li.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have a name?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember.”\r\n\r\nLu Shang said, “Then I will call you Li Sui. From now on, you will be with me.”\r\n\r\nFrom that day onward, a young “lover” was always by Lu Shang’s side.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYears later, Dr. Leung teased Lu Shang, “You didn’t get his heart, instead your heart caved in; boss Lu, that doesn’t seem like a bargain.”>"
