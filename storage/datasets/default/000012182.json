	"description": "My name is 'Araki Jin'.\r\n\r\nA second year student attending a high school in the city.\r\n\r\nOn my way home from shopping, I looked up at the tower apartment with my little sister who had just gone to elementary school.\r\n\r\nMy little sister, Mai, described a 50-story structure building that was just built last month as 'It looks like a castle!'.\r\n\r\nFrom my POV, it looked like a cold inorganic object. ......Of course, I'm not being sarcastic.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy my sister's longing for fairy tales. \r\n\r\n'Maybe a princess lives here.'\r\n\r\nI say to myself.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time I think, \r\n\r\n-A princess has nothing to do with us.\r\n\r\nBut I was wrong.\r\n\r\nReality is not a fairy tale.\r\n\r\nA prince can be a bad guy, and a monster can be a hero.\r\n\r\nThat's why it's possible for me to meet the princess, Shindo Rei, who lives on the top floor of a tower apartment building.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind, please listen.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairytale story about me and Rei, but it's not a lie, it's reality.>"
