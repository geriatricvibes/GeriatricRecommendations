	"description": "Thousands of years ago, God bestowed upon eight humans the duty to pass down his oracles. As messengers of God, they brought eternal light and hope to the world. People who worshipped the dark God were driven out and were forced to hide beneath the shadows. And this is how the legends of the priests ascending to God’s throne began… \r\nFacing unknown motives and changes, as well as the ascension ceremony that takes place once a century, the 37th generation successors are bound to accept heavy duties that they themselves can never imagine. There isn’t only one pair of hands controlling the future, and the world of priests is about to face unrest that none has ever seen.>"
