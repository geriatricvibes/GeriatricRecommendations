If he had one wish, it would be to study from sunrise to sunset forever. But one day, when he gets into a car accident and wakes up in a hospital with amnesia, he is confronted by three girls claiming that theyâ€™re his girlfriends: Yu Yuyu, his classmate; Han Ka-ryeon, his junior at his part-time job; and Ahn Yeon-hee, his younger sister.\n\nAre they really telling the truth? A chaotic, mysterious, harem comedy of love and lies!>"
