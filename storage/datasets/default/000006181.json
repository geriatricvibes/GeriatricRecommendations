	"description": "I’m a second year high schooler, Tohru Yonekura. I have a childhood friend, Rin Asakura. She has good grades and is quite the athlete. Admittedly, she has a bit of an attitude and is tough to deal with sometimes.\n\nI’ve always had unrequited feelings for her, but she always seemed so distant. Every day I would constantly mull over how to shorten the distance between us.\n\nHowever one day, I noticed a change in Rin. She would invite me to the movies, treat me to some homemade cooking and hug me tightly when we hung out at home.\n\nWith every passing day, I could feel the walls between us starting to break down.\n\nMe and my insincere childhood friend: this is our story, our bittersweet romcom.>"
