	"description": "The little woman was so innocent, and he couldn’t get enough of her. \r\nThe big man was so dominant, she couldn’t resist. \r\nMarriage? Are you joking? \r\nAs the president of the Qin Group, Qin Yijie, could get any beauty. Why would he still marry?\r\n\r\nIf he agreed to his parents’ wishes and found a woman who was a nuisance, he wouldn’t be able to do what he wanted!\r\nHe would never use the name Qin again!\r\nWomen had always bored him,  they had always been shallow and money-grubbing creatures. Since he was a child, women have pestered him. \r\nThere were more than enough women to go around him a hundred times. \r\nBut looking at the young and tender Shi Mier, he realized that there were still women in this world that he wanted, but wouldn’t dare to have. \r\nWhat was more, he thought that Shi Mier was just a woman who was out to seduce him, pretending and trying to get away. \r\nSo he would be responsible? No way. \r\n\r\nIn the end, he was the one who was entangled, he was the one who fell in love first.\r\nShe was his woman anyway, so he thought he might as well marry her!\r\n\r\n>"
