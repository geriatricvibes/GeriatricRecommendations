	"description": "Koichi Kasuga is a second-year high school student who is a bit of a hack.\r\n\r\nHe feels lucky to be in the same class as Sakurako Tojo, the most beautiful girl in the school, and to be seated next to her.\r\n\r\nHowever, for some reason, she has a harsh and poisonous tongue only towards Koichi, while she is kind and cheerful towards all other students, regardless of gender.\r\n\r\nKoichi couldn't stand the unreasonableness of it and asked her, 'Why are you so venomous only with me?'. He then, received a shocking answer: 'Because I want to marry you in the future...'\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Koichi's school life becomes a lot more fun.>"
