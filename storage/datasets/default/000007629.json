	"description": "「Welcome to the horror game .」\n\nThere was a long description of the game on the transparent window.\n\nAs if in disbelief, she glanced down the dark hallway, bewildered.\n\n“Is it true?”\n\n****\n\nWhen Fidelis opened her eyes, she was in the arms of a man whose eyes glued to her. The man gently touched her eyes and opened his red lips.\n\n“It’s too cold to just lay on the floor.”\n\n“Ah, thank you-” A white window appeared to the side of the man before she could even speak.\n\n「Name: Hakan Declan\n\n   Features: … … . 」\n\nAs I tilted my head while looking at the letters that appeared behind me, a shocking word came to my mind.\n\n「Feature: Psychopath.」\n\n… Yes? Pardon?\n\nShe blinked and looked at the transparent screen window and the man alternately. He smiled softly and trimmed Fidelis’ hair.\n\n“What’s on my face?”\n\nAh, I think even a psychopath is hidden in this game…\n\nFidelis, unable to say that, vigorously shook her head.>"
