	"description": "Lu Wenxing was very confused, obviously he had a beautiful face which was admired by everyone in the entertainment industry, he could sing, dance and act, but he still wasn’t popular.\n\nUntil…\n\nHe had a dream.\n\nIn the dream he was just a character in a book, the ending was already predetermined.\n\nAll his efforts were worthless under the aura of the main character Wen Yu.\n\nBecause –\n\nHe was a cannon fodder that set off the main character.\n\nLu Wenxing didn’t want to be a sidekick, so he handed a letter of termination of contract to the agent. The next day, he accidentally became popular because of a video.\n\n[Ah!!! I can’t believe it, such a cute brother!]\n[Crowdfunding small brother’s debut, please! ! ! 】\n\nWho was planning to leave the entertainment industry? ? ?\n\nThe entire C city knew that the Wen family had a little prince who was loved by thousands of people, and his birthday party was so flamboyant and extravagant that it made the headlines.\n\nBut what they didn’t know was that Wen Yu wasn’t the youngest prince of the Wen family. And the real young prince was abducted at an early age and hadn’t been found.\n\nWhen the paternity test report came out, the Wen family couldn’t wait to find Lu Wenxing, but they were afraid of scaring him.\n\n“Xingxing, do you remember mommy?”\n\n“Xingxing, I’m dad, does that ring a bell?”\n\n“Xingxing, call me brother.”\n\n#Shocking news! The popular star Lu Wenxing is actually the lost little prince of the Wen family! #\n\n[Ahhhhh! Prince choose me, I’m super sweet!]\n[All of you should leave, I’m the real Crown Princess!]\nThe movie star Gu Yanshen, who hasn’t sent a single tweet in months, quietly went online: @LuWenxing, the little prince, is mine.>"
