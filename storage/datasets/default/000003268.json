	"description": "I possessed a supporting character in a reverse harem novel.\r\n\r\nAs a young concubine who gained the interest of the emperor. The concubines and male lords eventually killed her for treason.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I possessed her just as she was entering the Imperial Palace. Everyone in the Imperial Palace was wary of me, but didn't hate me yet. I don't need nor want to be loved by the emperor.\r\n\r\n'Come to my room tonight. I'll read you a fairy tale!'\r\n'Woo, don't cry. I'll give you this.'\r\n\r\nBut why is everyone so soft towards me? I don't understand.\r\n>"
