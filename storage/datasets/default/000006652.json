	"description": "Yan Ci has an illness, and Wen Luo has the medicine.\n\nWen Luo: “Marry me, and the medicine is yours.”\n\nYan Ci: “Get lost, I don’t want your medicine even if I die.”\n\nWen Luo smirked.\n\nThen, the real scene:\n\nWen Luo: “Baby, come, take your medicine.”\n\nYan Ci opens his mouth.\n\nA two-faced, scheming top with a sweet-tempered outer appearance and a sickly, but violent, self-proclaimed aloof bottom.\n\nLater on, someone, who often had a hoarse voice and red, swollen eyes every morning, was dissatisfied. He was clearly the one that should have been the top.\n\nWen Luo: I will do it gently in the future.\n\nYan Ci: On the very first night, I can’t believe it; a man’s mouth can spew so many lies.\n\nWen Luo: Actually, I really did control the intensity.\n\nYan Ci: Control? Is it the kind where the other person is near death? Or when he becomes a ghost?\n\nWen Luo: …or else, looks like my baby is really curious. Why don’t we try it once again?\n\n It’s better to act rather than to keep wondering.\n\n After more than an hour,\n\nYan Ci: Ugh…\n\n‘My body is wasted today as well. My waist and legs are sore.’\n\nGreat, Yan Ci dug his own grave again.>"
