	"description": "Before she jumped into the pond filled with ten thousand venomous creatures, Ah Lai asked her, ‘Did you ever regret meeting him?’\r\n\r\nSu Bai watched her quietly. After a long moment, she lifted her lips and smiled. ‘It was the greatest blessing of my life to have met him.’\r\n\r\nAnd she leapt off the steps. \r\n\r\nShe thought: no matter how difficult her love was, no matter how she hated and then despaired, in this life, she was immensely fortunate. \r\n\r\nBecause she had once loved a person so deeply. \r\n\r\nEven if, he had never loved her.>"
