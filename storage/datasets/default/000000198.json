	"description": "A trading company employee who kept on working overseas finally set himself free from being a corporate s*ave after winning a one billion yen at  Jumbo Lottery during the end of the year. As a former trading company employee who proclaim himself being a misanthropist bought a farm located on the countryside of Hokkaido in order to become a farmer. When he was enjoying living the comfortable farm life as an unmarried man thanks to the advantages of the internet where you could order things online, an incident occurred. \n\nHe was warped into somewhere else along with his chicken coop. \n\nFor the time being, he’d continue eating the eggs from his chickens. >"
