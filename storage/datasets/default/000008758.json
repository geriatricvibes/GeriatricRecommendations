	"description": "In her last life, as the most honorable saint in Europe and France, Elulu was extraordinarily beautiful, delicate and noble, and held an even higher power than the royal family. Under her command were seven loyal knights with believers spanning across all sorts of races. This was a true winner of life.\r\n\r\nHowever, one day, she suddenly died and got rebirthed into a little loli that looked exactly like her but was the humblest of s*aves. Elulu immediately became stupefied. Afterwards, she found out that those loyal knights of hers, not only were they all non-human, but they were just freaking sickos under the skin of a self-restrained knight. All held all sorts of sick and perverted inner thoughts towards her.\r\n\r\nElulu:….is it too late to die once more?>"
