	"description": "Running around with the appearance of a boy, the lively commoner girl Tiese, had a beautiful and perfect childhood friend. He, since childhood, didn’t realize that Tiese was a girl, yet was so kind that he felt moral responsibility every time she ended up getting hurt.\n\nThe childhood friend defeated the half-demon king, and returned as a Hero. While not knowing the reason he went and returned from the journey, Tiese was thinking of  parting from her anxious childhood friend, but……Before the job she was about to take just next, she, got involved with a kind Demon King with love troubles, and his not so kind Prime Minister.>"
