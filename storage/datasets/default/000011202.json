I don’t want to get promoted and get busy! I just want to stay in a peaceful country and read every day. 」 \n\nIt was wishful thinking for Falsa, the half-demon, and half-human, as the people around him valued him highly, leading him to embark on a path of success from which he cannot return. \n\nFalsa continues to work every day, fearing when his true identity will come out.>"
