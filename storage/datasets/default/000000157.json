	"description": "Green smoke is coming out of the Xu family's ancestors' grave! \r\n\r\nMrs. Xu, who is already a grandmother, is pregnant! \r\n\r\nMr. Xu, who has proven that he is still extremely strong for his age, is now walking around with his head held high! \r\n\r\nAs for the three daughters-in-law, they are now shivering in fear. It doesn't matter if it's a son or a daughter because they would now have another person to serve. Oh god, how would they be able to live their lives now? \r\n\r\nAfter ten long months, Mrs. Xu finally gave birth to a cute little girl â€” Fu Bao. Her arrival entirely changed the Xu family. \r\n\r\nFu Bao: 'Mother, I caught a rabbit!' \r\n\r\nFu Bao: 'Father, is this gold?' \r\n\r\nEldest Xu: 'Little sister, could you take a look at me and see if today is a good day to go into the woods?' \r\n\r\nSecond Xu: 'Fu Bao~ Am I the brother that treats you the best?' \r\n\r\nThird Xu: 'Bao~ You have to wish me best of luck so that I'll pass my exam. I'll buy you beautiful clothes on your way home!' \r\n\r\nAll her sisters-in-law: 'Oh dear, just leave it. We will do it instead!' \r\n\r\n>"
