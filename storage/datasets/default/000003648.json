It’s written in stone!」declaring this proudly, childhood friends Asahina Murasaki and Mizuhara Hikaru were sucked into an ancient scroll found in a decrepit shrine.\n\nThrust into an unknown land, the one who saved Hikaru was a beautiful fox-eared girl who proclaimed herself the guardian of the capital.\n\nShe declared this towards a dumbfounded Hikaru,\n\n「Incompetent, what kind of attitude is that towards your master?」\n\nBefore he realized it, he had been made the servant of this foul-mouthed girl, but even so, what he got involved in while searching for his childhood friend was\n\nA conspiracy?\n\nOr bloodshed?\n\n「I just wanted to live a peaceful life……」\n\nThe curtain splendidly rises in a fight of love and action in a different world.>"
