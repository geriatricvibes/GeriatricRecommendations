The idiot, along with the dragonlord in his dream, entered a college, acknowledged a master, and reached a lot of achievements…\r\n\r\nSoon, however, one blow after another, he lost everything he had. What was worse, he was hit with harsh punishments for also being a dragonlord. This time, would miracles come to his aid and make him a life winner again?\r\n>"
