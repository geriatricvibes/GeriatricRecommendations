	"description": "After Song Qi was seriously injured and unconscious, she was forcibly bound by a system that walked the plot. She is the heroine of the little white flower in every plot.\n\nAs long as you walk through all the worlds, you can regain consciousness and return to reality.\n\nAs the devil in the alliance and the killing machine in the war, Song Qi said: Ha ha.\n\nIn every world, there is always such a vicious female partner of white lotus and green tea.\n\nQuietly dying without knowing it.\n\nSong Qi looked at her and smiled silently.\n\nSince you “hate” me so much, it’s better to stay by my side forever.\n\nSystem: The host, please don’t take the plot bias! Don’t match up with vicious women!\n\nVicious female partner X is a little panicked recently, and the heroine looks a little abnormal.\n\nAsked her to eat and watch a movie, and smiled softly at her.\n\nI thought that the heroine had lost her mind, but later discovered that the other party was actually bent!\n\nWhy is the romance heroine bendy!\n\nMy world is full of darkness, and you are the light I don’t want to let go.>"
