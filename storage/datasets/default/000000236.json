	"description": "A crunchy and crispy chicken. The stretchy cheese on pizza, and eating ramyeon at 1 in the morning! I only wanted to eat delicious food. So why is my life in danger because of bulimia*?!\r\n\r\nThere’s a place where I can fulfill my most cherished dream of eating everything I want!\r\n\r\nThe virtual reality game Athenae!\r\n\r\nI’m just eating well but isn’t this a bit weird?\r\n\r\nThe true value of food\r\n\r\n(Acquired +1 STR)\r\n\r\nThe stat went up.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\n*Raw text says 폭식 결여증 which literally means deficiency in binge eating. I’m assuming this is the Non-purging Type of Bulimia.>"
