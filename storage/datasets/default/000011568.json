	"description": "Me, an ordinary librarian, is in a novel.\n\nI got possessed by the villain supporting role ‘Erika’.\n\nAll I was given was an ending in which I was sentenced to beheading for taking part in the rebellion.\n\nIt’s unfair to work as a librarian even after being possessed by a romance novel, but you can’t even cut your throat.\n\nI became a librarian at the Royal Library to survive…\n\n“The way the Reinhardt family repays their favor is deep and long. So I hope you enjoy it slowly.”\n\nGrand Duke Carlix, who’s the male lead, is chasing me around saying he’ll repay me.\n\n“If I had been born a man, I would have welcomed you as a companion.”\n\nFrisia, the female lead, has confessed with a friendly gaze.\n\n“I want to have you as my own royal librarian.”\n\nCrown Prince, the second male lead, takes attendance stamps at the library every day\n\n“Your life and even your soul are mine, my queen.”\n\nEven the villain Archduke Franz is obsessed with me?\n\n“Nothing is more important than your happiness as your guardian.”\n\nThe only thing I can trust is William, the kind and friendly library manager…\n\nCan I go back to the original world?>"
