	"description": "Midnight. \r\n\r\nA slow elegiac song enveloped the cold night. \r\n\r\nYe Wenshui stood beneath a flowering tree with his hands clasped behind his back. The light of the moon and stars shone on his clear face, further illuminating his porcelain-like purity. \r\n\r\nThe sound of heavy military boots came from not too far away as the flowers upon the ground were crushed underfoot. >"
