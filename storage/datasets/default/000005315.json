	"description": "As a human reborn as a viper, all aspects of Yin Xiaoxiao’s life were beautiful except for when it came to food.\n\nAs a silver snake meeting an ink snake, Yin Xiaoxiao could accept whatever his husband’s clan was.\n\nAs a viper with no inherited memories, Yin Xiaoxiao found that the ancient tomb and all the different snake clans could really stress a snake out.\n\nIn summary, Yin Xiaoxiao’s life is nothing but this: Different viper clans marry. The old tomb is ruled by his next-door neighbor’s clan. My spouse, Heitan, this naughty precious snake, worries me.\n\nActually, this is the story of an evil little black snake doting on a confused foolish little silver snake. \n\nBoss Mo: Yin Xiaoxiao, you’ve stolen honey again!\n\nYin Xiaoxiao: It was definitely your sons who ate it!\n\nBaby snakes: Dad’s a lying snake!>"
