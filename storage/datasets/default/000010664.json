	"description": "The devil in a white lab coat – Amano Yuuji is a handsome guy and a genius. But his personality is the shittiest, even going so far as to call himself “The Genius Asshole.” He is by no means a righteous protagonist, but don’t miss out on the teachings, garbage, and others. It’s a little pretentious but kind (?) story.>"
