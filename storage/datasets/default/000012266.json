	"description": "Ji Xiangkong, a well-known “battlefield fraudster.” His face value made him good at picking up girls, causing many girls outside the esports circle to become his fans.\n\nAt an international esports competition, Qiu Ying, who was misunderstood as “the number one green tea b*tch of game streaming,” met him.\n\nShe originally thought she had caught a trump card who could save the popularity of her stream, but she was completely unaware that his reputation inside the esports circle was strangely terrible. When they were together, her popularity fell, instead of rising.\n\nThat farce connected her to him by fate. Through misfortune, she realized the goal that she wanted to fight for. And by accident, she found out that he was actually a misunderstood genius…\n\nTheir fates intertwined due to a misunderstanding, and developed into a sweet love. Even if they are misunderstood, why not bear a bad name? They would fight back to win the supreme glory that was for them alone.>"
