	"description": "In the presence of strangers, Han Chen was always handsome and cold, making it difficult for others to get close to him. He was like the frosted snow – pure, and slightly chilly. Yet, he was also like the river flowing in the dark night – quiet and moving. To many, he was akin to an unparalleled and untouchable god.\n\nOnly in the presence of Bai Jin Xi would this famous top police superintendent expose his deeply hidden shameless nature.\n\n“Come and sit nearer to me, I won’t eat you. At least, not now.”\n\n“I have never touched other women before. Do you want to check my body?”\n\n“Bai Jin Xi, never ever leave my side. Every year, every month, every moment, every minute, every second.”\n\nIn her heart, there exists an obstinate old man – one who has tirelessly loved her throughout all these years.>"
