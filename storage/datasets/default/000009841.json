	"description": "“Even I can write better than this, argh.”\n\n[Then, why don’t you try?]\nI possessed a supporting character in a novel I was reading.\n\nThe supporting character Amelie, who was killed by the tyrant.\n\nIn order not to meet him, I tried transformation and all kinds of means, but I still couldn’t escape the clutch of the tyrant, Serwin.\n\nI thought all that was left for me was death, but…\n\n“It’s weird. If I smell this scent…”\n\nBut this man, he can’t even act consciously when he looks at me?\n\n“Did you not know? The fact that you smell good.”\n\nAs if he was bewitched by my scent, he approached me. Then, he bent down and took a deep breath.\n\n“Your Majesty, stop…”\n\nWhen Amelie whispered her cry, she could feel Serwin’s low voice next to her ear.\n\n“You tried to run away. Didn’t you already make up your mind by then?”>"
