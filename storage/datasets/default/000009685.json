	"description": "On one fateful morning, Zhao Xi stumbles upon a heavily injured man on the Phoenix Mountain, unaware it was none other than the Prince Regent who held power over the land and fell into misfortune. In a plight of her own to detract potential marriages, Zhao Xi offers to save the man on one condition: he must be her husband for a year.\r\n\r\nHer days begin to slowly burn away between taking care of the fussy bear, Ping An, and her taciturn companion.>"
