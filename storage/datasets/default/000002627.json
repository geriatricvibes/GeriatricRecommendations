What is the happiest thing in life?\n\nThe most painful thing was that after untold hardships, for that small glory at the end but was returned back to the starting point in just one night.\n\nThe happiest thing was that after returning back to the starting point, without doing anything, was able to become overpowered overnight.\n\nZhou Jian in just one day, experienced his life most painful and happiest thing.\n\nThe most painful thing was his painstakingly raised professional Thief game account in the online world was “lost” by the system.\n\nThe happiest thing was the reason behind his game account loss. The Thief from his game account had appeared in the real world. And become a controllable God of Thieves.\n\nIn short, this is a relaxing YY (tl: Chinese slang for light perversion) story, full of plots where playing the pig to eat the tiger. >"
