	"description": "The Second Princess, Claire Fatenam, possessed no charisma, an intelligent, but ill-mannered princess.\n\nShe’s the princess of a defeated country that has recently lost a war and is about to marry into the enemy country, the Kingdom of Vallatenear.\n\nIn this political marriage, she is nothing more than a hostage and a sacrifice. Believing that being killed as soon as she got married was inevitable, she gave up on living her life as she married into the enemy country. As both her older sister and younger sister were beautiful, charismatic, and well-educated, Claire knew she would be the one to be married off.\n\nBut what awaited her was an unexpected reaction…?\n\n'Welcome, Claire! This place will be your home and country from this day forward. And if there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know.'\n\nClaire was perplexed by the warm welcome she received not only from the crown prince, Aglia, but also from the servants, bureaucrats, and His Majesty the King.\n\nIn this kingdom of Vallatenear, Claire was called this—a person overflowing with knowledge.>"
