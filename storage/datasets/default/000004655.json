	"description": "She is the most silly concubine he doesn't want to see.\n\nHe is the unparalleled king of the world.\n\nThe two most unlikely people are tied together, is it fate or fate?\n\nShe pretended to be weak and pretended to be a pig and eat a tiger, beat the white lotus violently, and overwhelmed all of Kyoto with poison!\n\nHe sheltered her from the wind and rain, and subverted the world for her.\n\nA certain prince tore off a piece of paper from his face, glanced at it and asked, 'What is this?'\n\nA certain woman said casually: 'Oh?
