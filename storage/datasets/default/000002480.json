	"description": "Forced out by her step-mother, she was driven to desperation and had no way of surviving other than to sign herself away and marry herself into a rich and influential family. \r\n\r\nThree years into the marriage, her wealthy husband had spoiled her to heavens. \r\n\r\nThe only problem was that they had no inheritors in their family. \r\n\r\nInside the luxurious mansion, Pei Qiqi angrily threw a stack of newspaper onto the man, “The article is claiming that I am a hen who cannot lay eggs! But Tang Yu, it’s you who has issues!” \r\n\r\nThe man put down the newspaper and agreed to what his young wife was saying, “Why would they write false information? Your zodiac is the pig!” \r\n\r\n“Tang! Yu!” She stomped her feet out of anger. \r\n\r\nThe man grinned, “So what we have no kids? You are my little baby.” \r\n\r\nPei Qiqi thought, how did this scene change so fast! \r\n\r\n>"
