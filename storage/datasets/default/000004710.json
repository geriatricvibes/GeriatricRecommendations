	"description": "The cruelest way to take down an enemy is to make them fall in love.\n\n“Sally, you smell good.”\n\nCaptain Leon Winston, a vulgar monster clothed in the skin of a stoic and elegant noble. He was a pathetic bastard who only raged at the smell of blood from the torture chambermaid.\n\nHowever, as soon as her name came out of the revolutionary army spy’s mouth with a scream, he became a pathetic dog in heat.\n\n“I can’t bully a good child, so I endured it… But I don’t have to endure it anymore. Thank you, Sally.”\n\nWhen Leon Winston stripped off his noble skin… \n\n“No, Grace.”\n\nGrace asked him.\n\nDid she meet or create a monster when she was young?\n\nIn the end, she agreed to a disgusting deal with the enemy to protect the revolutionary army.\n\n“Beg.”\n\n“F*ck me harder.”\n\nHe vowed every time she begged for her life miserably from the enemy…\n\n…One day, I will make you miserable.\n\nSo, try begging.\n\nAll you’ll get is regret.>"
