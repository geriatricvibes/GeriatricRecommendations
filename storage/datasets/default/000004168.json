He is the cannon fodder villain who scolds and beats up the male protagonist. Making things difficult for him and ending up miserably.\n\nAfter being reborn and recalling the ending of his previous life. Jian Xiuyun decided to make a fresh start, he planned to resist the disgust in his heart and he will treat Kan Wenxiao like his own son.\n\nAs soon as he opened his eyes, he found that Kan Wenxiao was tied to the furnace cauldron by him, and he was holding a dagger in his hand.\n\nFacing such a scene, Jian Xiuyun calmly cut the rope on Kan Wenxiao's body with the dagger, then stretched out his hand at him and said, 'Be good, come here, master will carry you.'\n\nKan Wenxiao had always known that Jian Xiuyun didn't like him because he had an ugly face.\n\nAlthough later he didn't know why Jian Xiuyun suddenly changed his attitude, he could still feel his pretense and reluctance.\n\nKan Wenxiao felt that there was an unspeakable anger burning in his heart, but there was something else under this anger.\n\nHe didn't know what it was until he held Jian Xiuyun in his arms and sprayed uncontrolled words in his master's ears.\n\n'Master, can I exchange my sincerity for your sincerity?'>"
