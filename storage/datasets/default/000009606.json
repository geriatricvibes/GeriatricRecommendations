	"description": "Su Jin, an ordinary poor young man from the countryside working overtime every day to make ends meet in the city to support his family, finds himself in the possession of a book only known as Hell’s Handbook.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook universe initially seems like a video game as it proceeds to throw him into a different world every month, each world filled with supernatural beings, mythical creatures and deities, and even includes a complete point system along with weapons and special skills.\r\n\r\nSurviving these challenges is not easy, but it comes with great rewards.\r\n\r\nBut he soon realizes that all of this is real. The monetary rewards and magical items he receives from Hell’s Handbook can be used in the real world, but in the same way, every person who dies during a challenge dies in the real world too.\r\n\r\nAs Su Jin desperately tries to survive each challenge he is thrown into, he slowly starts to uncover the truth behind Hell’s Handbook.\r\n\r\nWho is behind Hell’s Handbook and its horror filled challenges? Each challenge reveals a new truth about the world Su Jin lives in, bringing new people into his life even as the world around him becomes harder and harder to trust, and perhaps, even a greater mission in life…>"
