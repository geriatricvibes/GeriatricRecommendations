	"description": "When Lu Wu opened his eyes, he found that the world had changed completely. \r\n\r\nThe world before him did not have fancy magic, nor ultimate Dou Qi. \r\n\r\nWhat it had were summoners that form contracts with summoned beasts. \r\n\r\nAnd coincidentally, he was such a summoner, although not a professional one, and his first summoned beast was a piece of crap. \r\n\r\nBut that was fine, because he also had a golden finger! \r\n\r\n>"
