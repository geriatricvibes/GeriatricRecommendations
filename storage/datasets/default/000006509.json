One day, he was elected as a new unit and decided to be transferred from Leonardo's unit. The next morning when Dee was drunk with a drink that was held as a promotion celebration, Dee woke up and saw Leonardo in front of him. Or rather, there was a Leonardo's thing in it. * This is an erotic story.>"
