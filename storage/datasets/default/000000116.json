	"description": "No up and down, no marriage, and no breaking the law Tanaka family just lives modestly and sticks to the rules of society.\n\nThe ordinary Tanaka family, who loves cats and is loved by cats.\n\nThe unfortunate Tanaka family, that has a sweet ending somehow.\n\nThat very Tanaka family got attacked by a sudden major earthquake. When they thought that they died in an instant, the whole family reincarnated to another world.\n\nIs this an Otome game?\nOr somewhere else?\nAm I a villainous daughter?\nOr a capture target?\n\nI don’t know anyone. I don’t understand anything.\n\nThat monster is absurdly strong.\n\nHowever, I can’t use magic and I have no skill.\n\nThe last ray of hope is insects?\n\nIf I mention the things that I can do: sewing and looking after insects.\n\nA story about the Tanaka family living peacefully and modestly again for the time being in another world.>"
