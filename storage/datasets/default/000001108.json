	"description": "You Liangxing would never open the speech function in game.\n\nThat was because his voice was…\n\nParticularly! Kittenish!\n\nBut there was one day, he queued up with a teammate who had so much to say that they may as well explode. Vexed to the point of no return, he contributed a voice that was capable of splitting heaven and earth, “Don’t BB.”\n\nThe other party who was being scolded stilled. In the ensuing silence, he suddenly let out a long, relishing… moan.\n\nYou Liangxing: “…..”\n\nLater —\n\nHe realised that the person was a great god,\n\nMuch later,\n\nWithout him realising,\n\nHe became the great god’s royal healer.\n\n…. And also his boyfriend.>"
