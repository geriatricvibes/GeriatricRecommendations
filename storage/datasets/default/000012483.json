The girl, Yui, seems to be a real noblewoman, and her nickname is “Kuudere-lla” because of her indifferent reaction at school. When Natsuomi finds out that Yui doesn’t want to rely on others, but is actually quite naive, he decides to help her out.\n\n“What’s for dinner tonight, …… chicken karaage?\n\n“Chicken was cheap.”\n\n“I love your fried chicken, so I’m really looking forward to it.”\n\nThis is the beginning of a sweet and tantalizing relationship between two neighbors.>"
