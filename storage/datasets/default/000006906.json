	"description": "After the nuclear warfare, massacres started to spread throughout the entire world. The order between humans completely collapses, and the strong eats while the weak gets eaten becomes the #1 rule.\n\nWhen you lose the chains of desire, it means that you no longer have a road to go forward. You can only turn left, or face right.\n\nHell is to the left, but Hell could also to the right.>"
