	"description": "On the server “Altar,” a high-class survival game was officially launched. Survival was the only logic in the human game of alliance, betrayal, and human-natured games of deceit and treachery. After the smoke of gunpowder ends, only the survivors can speak.\n\nAs soon as he opened his eyes, the amnesiac An Wujiu saw a person at his side killed. While in confusion, a floating green typeface appeared before him.\n\nVariable Name: An Wujiu\nAttributes: Male, 20 years old\nGame Rounds: 5\nWin Rate: 100/100\nDanger Rank: SSS\n\nNo wonder they were afraid.\n\nThe first time he saw An Wujiu, Shen Ti felt curious. The kindness and fragility in those eyes were not fake, so how could he survive in the Altar? It was until he saw the man had a sudden personality change. He recklessly gambled regardless of the cost, casually estranged people, grew further excited on the verge of death, and even calculated against himself to win. Only then did Shen Ti realize that it was his own cognitive bias.\n\nFortunately, he wasn’t a normal person either.>"
