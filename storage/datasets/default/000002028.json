	"description": "After saving a kitten from being hit by a car, Sudou Nozomi (25) unfortunately left this world.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was lucky enough to be reincarnated, it was to a place where my previous self’s best friend was obsessed with. This is the world from an otome game.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not the heroine who finds happiness. Only a bad end – where my engagement is nullified – awaits me. I have become the villainess Roselia! However, the current me is still only five years old, so I have time.\r\n\r\n“I still have time to spare! The future is hopeless, I might even die, so let’s live freely until then!”\r\n\r\nI will improve myself leisurely.>"
