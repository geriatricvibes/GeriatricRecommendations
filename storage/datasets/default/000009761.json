	"description": "I became the villainous sister of the protagonist in a reverse harem game. Supposedly, she got possessed around the time the heroine ran away. \r\n\r\nThis fake sister was the only antagonist in the game, a unique villainess who deeply hates both the female protagonist and her male leads. Her ending is doom at the hands of the male leads, dying in vain when the runaway heroine returns. \r\n\r\nSo, I don’t want any love or affection from them, and I won’t give any favors to this family that will abandon me. I will leave this beggar’s game.\r\n\r\nI wrote down the names of the four male leads, and my two elder brothers. \r\n\r\nSomeone must help me leave. But when I list them down, they’re all useless.\r\n\r\nI have no choice but to dream of leaving by myself.\r\n>"
