	"description": "“You’re mine.”\r\n\r\nWhen Raphia met her demise after having been used and thrown away by her benefactor, Yuri, she went back nine years in the past.\r\n\r\n‘I’m not going to relive that hell!’\r\n\r\nRunning away from her benefactor, she went to Kasein Soleia, Yuri’s archnemesis, and signed a new sponsorship contract with him.\r\n\r\n“I shall kill every single person you despise, Milord.”\r\n“The necessary role happens to be open, and you might just be the right person for it.”\r\n\r\nYoung Duke. This is a sponsorship contract, right?\r\nBut why . . . why are we getting married?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“Throughout the time I won’t be by your side . . . I will think of nothing but your small, cute head.”\r\n\r\nThat low voice sent shivers down her spine.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe you’re leaving. I’ll just . . .”\r\n\r\nKasein looked at her sharply as if he was daring her to continue making up excuses.\r\n\r\n“You have to answer well, brat. Depending on what you say, all the wagon and shoe craftsmen of the Empire might lose their livelihood.”\r\n\r\nDespite his harsh words, Kasein’s touch was gentle.\r\nHe couldn’t take his eyes off of Raphia, who strangely grew more beautiful by the day.>"
