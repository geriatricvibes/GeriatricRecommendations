Across the light cloud of smoke, he squints his eyes—watching as Lin Nuan's slim arms wrap around his neck; he feels stirred. \r\n\r\nSo a person can love another so passionately. \r\n\r\n'You call what you did a kiss?' \r\n'…' \r\n'What a pure lady!' \r\n\r\nFu Huai'an spews out a cloud of smoke and snuffs out the cigarette. With a mellow voice, he says, 'Let me teach you what kissing is!' \r\n\r\nBut, what he teaches Lin Nuan doesn't seem to be only a kiss…>"
