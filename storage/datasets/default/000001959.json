The most beautiful lovers’ prattle she has ever heard is 'I will punish those whom you have offended.' \r\n\r\nSkit: \r\n\r\n“A handsome man delivered a parcel to your wife just now, Sir.” \r\n\r\nThe young master acknowledged with a lazy “Mhm.” \r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, all courier companies in the city go belly up. \r\n\r\n'Your wife has offended someone, Sir.' \r\n\r\n'Mhm.' \r\n\r\nTen minutes later, that person is left to die in a desolate mountain. \r\n\r\n>"
