	"description": "When he regained consciousness he was already in another world. There was no meeting with a God, no cheat skills, just a sudden reincarnation. There was no time to find his bearings either, he was in a life-or-death trouble from the start that would somehow result in being employed as a valet to a vain youngster from an aristocratic family.\n\nHe would, in time, discover an astonishing truth about this new world and vow to fight it with all his might to protect the people important to him. No matter how reckless that would be.>"
