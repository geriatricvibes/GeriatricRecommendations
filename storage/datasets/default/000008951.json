	"description": "The Holy Knight Luciel Mel-Yard was bored.　\n\nIt had been a whole day since he was put under house arrest in this room without knowing what was going on. The only thing he could do was muscle training. It was Cavan Rossina, the deputy magician of the royal palace, and also Luciel’s rival, who told him what was going on. \n\nAccording to Cavan, Luciel was suspected of having committed adultery with a nobleman’s daughter.\n\nIt was an awful scandal for a holy knight who had to be a virgin.\n\n“In honor of the Holy Knight who has stood high, I will personally interrogate him with great care and attention.”\n\nIn this way, the Holy Knight Luciel was to undergo the naughty physical examination of the Magician Cavan.>"
