	"description": "Ning Yixiao thought he would never see Su Hui ever again.\n\nUntil the hotel room card mix-up, and he went in, seeing him lying on the bed with an eye mask on, calling out another person’s name, “You’re back so soon…?”\n\nImpulsivity made him pull off Su Hui’s eye mask, but the moment he met his gaze, he regretted it.\n\nIt had been six years of separation. Their reunion should have been a more presentable one.\n\n-”At least on the skybridge on Street 42, the us who have nothing at all once had the sight of Manhanttanhenge — even if it was only for 15 minutes and 20 seconds.”\n\nWildhearted top x sickly beautiful bottom.>"
