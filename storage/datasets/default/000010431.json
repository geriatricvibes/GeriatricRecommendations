	"description": "A life lived solely for the sake of the family. \r\nI couldn't hope for anything, and I didn't have anything.\r\nI thought it would be enough if I could just devote myself to the family.\r\nWhat returned at the end of that devotion was a dreadful death.\r\n\r\n'You dare not to know your place and covet the family's guardian magic, so pay it back with your life.' \r\n\r\nThat's how I died.\r\nBut that's not bad either. Death is eternal rest.\r\nI think I can rest now.…. \r\n\r\n'Are you up, miss?' \r\n\r\n……my rest is gone? \r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nAfter learning that I had returned to a year ago, I decided. \r\n\r\n'I'm going to die as soon as possible.'\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not easy to die because of the family's guardian magic. So I went to find a man.\r\nThe head of a family that that is hostile to the family I devoted my life to.\r\nThe only one who can break through the guardian magic and kill me.\r\n\r\n'Hello, the weather is nice. It's always cold in the capital, but I think it's a little warm these days.' \r\n\r\nSo... \r\n\r\n“Would you mind killing me?”>"
