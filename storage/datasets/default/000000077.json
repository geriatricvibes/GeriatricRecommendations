	"description": "Matsuoka is hooked on wearing his ex-girlfriend’s clothes and going for nighttime walks into town, feeling the pleasure of being stared at by men wherever he goes. One night, after he is assaulted by a man during a one-off encounter, he is saved by Hirosue, a nondescript senior worker from his company. Drawn to Hirosue’s innocent and pure love, Matsuoka continues to meet with Hirosue, all the while dressed as a woman, until Hirosue finally confesses to him. Narise Konohara’s pinnacle of achievement portrays the pain and beauty of unrequited love and has also been adapted to a theatrical play.\n\nContains 2 short stories (published in earlier editions) “Of Tenderness” (Itoshii koto) and “Of Love” (Aisuru koto).>"
