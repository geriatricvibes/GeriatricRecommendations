	"description": "I was just sleeping, but when I opened my eyes, I've become someone else in a white bridal dress.\r\n\r\nErin Spillet.\r\n\r\nI became the villainess of a novel.\r\n\r\nMy bridegroom, the male lead, kept making eye contact with another woman. It was the heroine; his love interest.\r\n\r\nWhat do they think they're doing when he's about to get wedded to someone else?\r\n\r\n'What's so good about this man?'\r\n\r\nBut then, someone asked me, who was only a supporting character and an uninvited guest in this novel that no one cared about.\r\n\r\n'Will you stay here or go outside?'\r\n\r\nI, who was dazed and barefooted, was given a new pair of shoes by the prince. He was being kind to me.\r\n\r\n'I don't think I need to stay any longer now that the ceremony is over.'\r\n\r\n'That's a wise judgment.'\r\n\r\nHe gracefully reached out his hand and I took it.\r\n\r\nHeroine, you can keep the male lead.>"
