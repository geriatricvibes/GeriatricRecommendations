	"description": "The heartwarming ghost hunting adventures of Mutsu, Hiroto, Sousuke and Toushiro.\r\n\r\nWhen the Heisei era (1989-2019) began, the world started becoming smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nWith just a cell phone people became able to obtain any information wherever they were, and distant lands across the ocean became only a plane flight away. And those are wonderful things.\r\n\r\nDespite that, the remains of an era of myths and legends still exist in this island country. They are what people call mysterious happenings.\r\n\r\nThings that can not be explained by science tend to excite people. That is because everyone believes that they are fictional.\r\n\r\nBut is it really fine to assume that the things that can not be explained by science don’t exist? The fact that most people don’t come into contact with something doesn’t mean that it’s not there. Even if it is something unbelievable.>"
