	"description": "I woke up in this new world as Diana Gundal, the youngest daughter of a feudal lord. \n\nBut hey, that’s great news! \nThat means I can live my life pampered from head to toe right? \n\nWrong! \nEveryday I’m living like a maid to help out with the household. \n\nWhat’s even worse is that I neither inherited the old Diana’s memories nor her knowledge of the language. I’m basically starting from scratch… I thought I would live the rest of my life like this until the Emperor came to visit our small village. \n\nBOOM! \nOh lord, he is so handsome! I’m now so thankful I’m living under the same sky as him. I will work hard to get closer to him as his new number one fan!>"
