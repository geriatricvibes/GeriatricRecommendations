	"description": "“The summer rays make for a harsh season, but how are you holding up? It is a pleasure to meet you. I am called Mary, and I am something of an urban legend in training. I understand that I am making a sudden, discourteous request, but if you would be so kind, could you please answer the phone? Of course, I have no intention of using up your time, and I am not considering anything as brazen as requesting you to play the part of a conversation partner.
