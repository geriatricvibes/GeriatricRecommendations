	"description": "When Su Jinyu held Gu Peilang's bloody corpse, he still couldn't react. He couldn't believe that the man who was supposed to spend his honeymoon with his newlywed wife in the United States would appear in front of him covered in blood, protect him from an explosion with his broken body, and fight for him. After the aftermath of the explosion, he took his last breath in his arms because of excessive blood loss. Gu Yin, who came in a hurry, looked at the lost youth in the ruins. When he left with Gu Peilang's body in his arms, he cursed at the person on the ground: 'You will never realize how much he loved you, Su Jinyu.'\r\n'Su Jinyu, just keep living like this, with the guilt towards him and the guilt of the Su family........just...... keep on living.'>"
