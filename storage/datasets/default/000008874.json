	"description": "Born into an old sorcerer's family, I didn't know how to use magic until I turned 10 years old. Unlike my brother, who's called a genius, I was a disgrace to the family and a useless child.  \r\n\r\n“Tell the Master to throw her away!”\r\n\r\nI know I'm not my parents' child.  I have a real dad. I went to find my real dad with a sad heart. \r\n\r\n'You are my daughter?' \r\n\r\nThe wizard, my real dad did not recognize my face. He is a scary perrson! Can we get along well? \r\n\r\n“Don't worry. It's alright.'\r\n\r\n'Try this too!'  \r\n\r\n'This too!' \r\n\r\nUnlike my nervous mind, when I want to leave, people here are a bit weird. You're too good to me. >"
