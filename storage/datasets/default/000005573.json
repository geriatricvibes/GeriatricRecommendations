	"description": "In the humid heat of July, students within the crowded classroom couldn’t breathe properly under the tremendous pressure of the intensive exams.\r\n\r\nGuo Jingyu’s forehead was damp with sweat.\r\n\r\nHe saw the figure seated in front of him as soon as he glanced up. His back was as straight as it had always been, his white shirt school uniform had a mild soap scent, and his hair was neatly parted. He was accompanied by the steady rustle of a pen.\r\n\r\nGuo Jingyu laughed, as if he’d been freed of a huge burden, and gently nudged the person in front of him twice with a pen, saying in a hushed whisper, “Li Tongzhou?” The teen in front of him halted and didn’t say anything, but he extended his hand behind him and handed him something.\r\n\r\nGuo Jingyu was lying motionless on his desk. With his fingers, he poked Li Tongzhou’s palm, which the other gently gripped.\r\n\r\nIn our youth’s fiery love, you’ve always been the only one.>"
