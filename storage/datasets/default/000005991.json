	"description": "Appraiser Laurent was kicked out from his guild 『Golden Hawk』.\n\nIt was a result of one-sided jealousy from the guild leader, Lucius.\n\nFeeling hurt and crushed by the sudden dismissal, a female mage named Lilianne gave him a helping hand.\n\nTogether with her, he decided to create a new guild to mess with Lucius.\n\nEventually, those talents that Laurent found through his appraisal skill will create the strongest guild.>"
