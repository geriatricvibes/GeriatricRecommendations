	"description": "Charlemann’s fourth princess, Canola F. Incana Charlemann.\n\nShe was expelled from Charlemann because of her brother’s fight for the throne, and she was informed that she should marry the only son of the monarch of Tripol, whom she knows neither face nor name.\n\nThe road on the way to Tripol over the rugged winter mountains for a wedding. She meets Ethel, the heir of Tripol, her bethrothed, her husband-to-be…\n\n“Princess, hurry and greet him…”\n\nCanola didn’t answer the reminder, just staring straight ahead.\n\nCanola, who was blinking her eyes and making such a s*upid expression, covered her mouth with her hand and turned around.\n\n“I think I’m in love.”\n\nSuch a pure and pretty man! She can’t help but love him!\n\n“A man who cannot protect his companion cannot become a Tripol warrior. We are… We still have a long way to go to become an official couple, but it is my job to protect you.”\n\nWhen Ethel had finished talking, he drove the beast he was riding and drove it far ahead.\n\nCanola, who had been staring at the back of his head, slowly returned into the carriage.\n\nThere was a red blush on her face.\n\n“See? Did you see? Look. Aren’t you in love with him?”\n\nI think they are interpreting the meaning of my words with a very distorted view.>"
