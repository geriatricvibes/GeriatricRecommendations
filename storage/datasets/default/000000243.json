	"description": "Gu Chaoyan is the eldest daughter of the Gu Family, yet the least favorite one. She is mostly despised and belittled by everyone around, only because she isn't pretty. \r\n\r\nLeft alone in her shabby Qiong Pavilion, she survives hard with her only friend, the maid, Qing, and expects to marry Prince Lu Jiming whom she adores deeply. However, the Prince betrays her and even drives her into jumping into a lake to kill her. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Gu Chaoyan survives and gets reborn, with the soul of an agent from the 21st century. From that moment on, Gu Chaoyan becomes someone totally different. She is no longer weak, clinging or naÃ¯ve. She uses her knowledge through medicine and makes herself pretty and slender. She also strikes back at those who bullied and looked down on her. Moreorover, she successfully attracts Lord Huai, the beloved child of the King and Queen. \r\n\r\nThey develop a relationship with each other and help each other throughout their lives. In this way, she not only manages to take revenge but also gains a high-level social status of herself as well as a dear love for her life a second time.>"
