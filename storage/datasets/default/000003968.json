	"description": "I took the male lead as my younger brother and I was reincarnated as the villainess who committed evil deeds that died at his hands.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the future of my death, I must not let his hatred worsen.\r\n\r\n'I'll now take good care of you.'\r\n\r\nI gifted him with presents to win his favor and give everything he desires. Eventually, I ended up sending him back to where he was supposed to be...\r\n\r\n'Are you going to be happy after you made me like this? There's no way.'\r\n\r\nSix years later, I was kidnapped on my way to my wedding. To the man I sent back.\r\n\r\n'Are you taking revenge on me?'\r\n\r\n'Do you want to know why I'm doing this? Then kiss me.'\r\n\r\nHe pulled my hand. In an instant, my body was dragged over to him.\r\n\r\n'It's all Sister's fault that I am acting like a fool, so Sister should take responsibility. Don't you think so?'\r\n>"
