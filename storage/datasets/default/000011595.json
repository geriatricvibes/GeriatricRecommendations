	"description": "An adolescent school caste love comedy at the mercy of an overly daring girlfriend!\n\nSasagawa Ayano is the flower of the class. When he accidentally saves her from being picked up—\n\n“Thank you, Fujimura.”\n\nSince then, she brings me home on holidays, asks me to praise her like a kid, or stay and sleep over.\n\nI thought I was enjoying my life as a loner in the shadows, but then I realized that her presence had become a part of my daily life…\n\nI am a gloomy guy, and I never thought she would remember my name! On top of that, she became oddly affectionate toward me and started to visit…?!\n\n“You’re coming home again today, right?”\n\n“A loner? Then I’ll have you all to myself!”\n\n“…Shouldn’t I think you’re special?”\n\nHe thought she was from a distant world, but now she’s zero distance away.\n\nThis is a youth caste love comedy in which he’s at the mercy of a girl who is too daring!>"
