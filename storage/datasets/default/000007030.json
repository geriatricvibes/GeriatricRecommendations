	"description": "As a cultivation genius who has achieved a new realm every two years since he was a year old, Wang Ling is a near-invincible existence with prowess far beyond his control. But now that he’s sixteen, he faces his greatest battle yet – Senior High School. With one challenge after another popping up, his plans for a low-key high school life seem further and further away…\r\n\r\nWang Ling: I just want to eat my crispy noodle snacks in peace…\r\n\r\nFather Wang: If you’re careless enough to destroy the country, it’s coming out of your pocket money.\r\n\r\nWang Ling: It’s not my fault that the backlash from punching me kills you.>"
