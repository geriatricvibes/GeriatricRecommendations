	"description": "Choi Ye-Hyeon, an F-class hunter with no combat ability, has only skills to check the status window of himself and the other hunters.\r\n\r\nChoi Ye-Hyeon made money by following the ranker party and selling potions and status ailments at a slightly higher price than the market price.\r\n\r\nThen, a huge gate that has never appeared before appears in the sky over Seoul. Due to the unusual size, the Hunter Association dispatched all the hunters, but they were annihilated before they even reached the boss room.\r\n\r\nJust before his death, a notification window flashes in Ye-Hyeon's blurred vision.\r\n\r\n【system】 Loading is complete. Do you want to start? (yes/no)\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, he went back to three years ago. Ye-Hyeon's ability (job), who was a simple 'player', was changed to 'dating sim player'.\r\n\r\nIn order to save his older sister who will be in coma, and to survive by clearing the extra-large gate that will appear three years later, Ye-Hyeon is uncertain, but he has no choice but to attack the four targets as the system tells him to.\r\n\r\n>"
