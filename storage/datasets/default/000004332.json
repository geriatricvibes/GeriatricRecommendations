	"description": "I was reborn as an extra character in a novel whose soul was sucked to death from the villain.\r\n\r\nIf you were reincarnated, what would you do?\r\n\r\nFor eighteen years, I lived under various abuses as a slave from my family.\r\n\r\nFortunately, before my parents forced me to be sold to the villain like in the original novel, I succeeded in running away.\r\n\r\nI spent a short but happy time with Momo, a stray dog I met in a rural village.\r\n\r\nBut three months later, the pampered puppy disappeared!\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, I was captured by my family and was given to the villain.\r\n\r\nThe moment I was discouraged when I was about to die,\r\n\r\n“Why are you so surprised? It’s me, Momo, your puppy.”\r\n\r\nMy beloved pet turned into a villain?\r\n\r\nAnd that villain is my “fated counterpart”?>"
