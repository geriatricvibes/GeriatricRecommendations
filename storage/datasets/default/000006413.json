	"description": "Eisuke Tsurugi is an ordinary high school student, except for the fact that he has strength that far exceeds that of normal people. One day, while hunting bullies out of boredom, he heard a voice in his head. “We need your power…! Please come… to our world…!” And before he knew it, the scenery of another world spread out before his eyes! As he marveled at the unfamiliar sight, the girl who summoned him approached him with a request: please defeat the “reincarnated cheating heroes” who dominated the world after defeating the demon king. Bored with lacking opponents who could fight him on equal terms, Eisuke willingly accepted the request at the prospect of fighting those heroes. “I will destroy all those pretentious heroes!” This is the heroic fantasy of the strongest high school student facing the reincarnated cheating heroes!>"
