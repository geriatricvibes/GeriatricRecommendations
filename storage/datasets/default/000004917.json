	"description": "It’s been 25 years since I found myself reincarnated in another world. I’m a traveler by profession, otherwise known as unemployed.\n\nWhile I was wandering around, trying to enjoy fantasy from top to bottom, I encountered an injured dragon girl.\n\nAs she looked at me, the image of the Demon Lord from the smartphone game I had played in my previous life came back to my mind.\n\nShe is a powerful opponent who is a great enemy of humankind, a brave man pulls out his sword and confronts the demon lord to get rid of it.\n\n…But.\n\nIn front of me, there is a girl whose clan was destroyed by humans and struggled to survive even if it became tattered.\n\nAt this rate, her destination is the two characters of ruin.>"
