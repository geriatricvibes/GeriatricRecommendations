	"description": "Chen Qi’s life was as ordinary as his name. He didn’t expect that he would one day suddenly encounter something like crossing over into another world, let alone crossing over into the dangerous world of beastmen. He can’t hunt or change into a beast form, and even his physical strength was a slag’s level, so how would he survive in this dangerous beastman world?\n\nToo dangerous outside? No matter, build a house, find food, make a comfortable home, and live in the beastmen tribe.\n\nNo tribe? No matter, we’ll build one ourselves.\n\nThis was the story of an ordinary person who worked hard every day to live and strived to make his life better.>"
