	"description": "Kenichi Yamada was a 35-year-old salaryman. As a hardcore game enthusiast, he was saddened by the modern trend towards casual games.\r\n\r\nSo, when a site claimed to be “for people who like to do things the hard way,” he just couldn’t resist. Thus, he was reincarnated into another world as Allen, playing on Hell Mode.\r\n\r\nThis is fantasy light novel about Allen’s journey as a summoner.\r\n\r\nReincarnated as a serf, he starts from nothing.\r\n\r\nHis journey begins with absolutely no knowledge of the world around him, just like those games he played 10, 20 years ago.>"
