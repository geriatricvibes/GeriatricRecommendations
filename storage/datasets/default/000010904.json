	"description": "Yume Ayukawa (real name: Ayumu Hinomoto) begins playing the VRMMO “Glory Crown” to become a “video game streamer”.\r\n\r\nShe’s allergic to animals, but she still wanted to play with the fluffy beast monsters of this world.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, she chose “Tame” as her beginning skill, but this world wasn’t going to be so easy on her.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, players are randomly awarded a title, but she ended up getting “Anti-Animal”.\r\n\r\nIt had the effect of making her despised by beasts.\r\n\r\nShe cried over it, but it seems that this title had a secret--?\r\n\r\nYume's video game streamer career, and her future title of 'The Wild Last Boss' and the 'Demon King' by players and viewers alike, are about to begin.>"
