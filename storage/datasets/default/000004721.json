	"description": "The princess of a neighboring country who stole the prince that the little mermaid saved…\nThat was me.\n\nI believed that it was me who saved him, but reality was cruel.\n\nWhen the little mermaid died and the truth was revealed—\n\n“It wasn’t you.”\n\nThe man who once said he loved me abandoned me after saying these words.\nJust because I wasn’t the one who saved him.\n\nFrom then on, he started to ignore me and shut me out.\n\nI couldn’t endure it any longer, so I chose to die. But somehow, I returned to the past.\nSo I made up my mind.\n\n* * *\n\nInstead of going through that again, I looked for a certain man.\n\nRobbed of his memory and exiled from the magic tower, but more powerful than anyone else.\n\nThe lord of the magic tower.\nAlejandro Diarmuid.\n\n“The memories you’ve lost. I’ll help you find them.”\n\nSo help me.\nSo that I can escape from this fate.\n\n“No one else but you can save me.”\n\nYou can save me.\nOnly you.>"
