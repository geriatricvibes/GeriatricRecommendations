	"description": "A rain of blood poured down from the sky as the prelude for the end of day.\n\nSunshine was but only forever a dream whilst the living was filled with eternal crimes.\n\nTo survive, the strong plundered till death as the weak struggled for their last breath.\n\nThen, society collapsed as everything began to relapse.\n\nFor a piece of stale bread, an olden pure maiden spread her legs.\n\nHumans were only animals as their lusts and greed eternally prevailed.\n\nA man’s soul went back to his former life to face the darkness and survive.\n\nClad in a dark-blooded coat, he traversed on the path of oaths.\n\nFor a hope he forever shielded, he rushed to the last battlefield.>"
