	"description": "A message affixed to the door of a flower shop saying, 'I will choose the flower that suits you best.'\n\nThe clerk will select and introduce the flowers that suit the customer, but there are only strange flowers that are not found in any other flower shop.\n\nNot this one, nor this one. I was strangely attracted to one flower.\n\nSo what of the flowers that weren't to your liking? If you don't need them, then let's dispose of them.>"
