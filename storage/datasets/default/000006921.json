	"description": "If Ke Xun could do it again, he would have never left his house to go out and flirt with guys, even if it would mean getting beaten to death.\n\nWeren’t they supposed to have just been taking shelter from the rain in a museum and looking at some erot*c paintings while they were at it? Why…did they enter the world inside a painting?!\n\nMu Yiran: Every single one of us is acting out a role in the painting.\n\nKe Xun’s eyes lit up: How do we get into an erot*c painting?\n\nMu Yiran gave him a long, drawn-out look: Shut your eyes and lie down.>"
