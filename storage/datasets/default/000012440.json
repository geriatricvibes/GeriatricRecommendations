	"description": "He, Murong Fang Qing, a romantic, natural, unrestrained, and an absolute beauty. His greatest interest is to appreciate and flirt with beauties. His biggest regret is that he came from a Wulin* family but did not know martial arts.\n\nThat day, he just looked for flowers and willows in the brothel as usual. How could the Emperor abduct him to the palace by mistake and conferred the title of “Consort Qing”?\n\nHe thought it was a trick of fate but unexpectedly, it was a turning point of life.\n\nOne is an all-powerful Emperor.\n\nOne is the Lord in distress who has excellent martial arts and beautiful appearance but has fallen into dust.\n\nOne is General Ling Biao, a famous and affectionate man.\n\nHow can these three men who are equally outstanding look at him at the same time? Can they see his heart clearly?>"
