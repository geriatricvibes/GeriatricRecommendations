	"description": "I, the sole daughter of a villain, was pitifully abandoned in the snow by my father due to my lack of ability. The male lead's father saved me, bringing me back with him.\n\nIf they discovered I was the daughter of a villain, I would definitely be killed. I’d run away, but because I am only a newborn baby, I need someone to take care of me before I can step out into the world.\n\nWell, I suppose there’s no choice but to flirt with the male lead's father!\n\n“Papa!”\n\nCome here~ Come take care of me~\nAm I not cute? You can’t leave me alone when I’m so lovely, right?\n\nHe stared at me, unable to stop himself from falling to my charm.\n\n“C-cute.”\n\nHmm? Papa, weren’t you acting so cold before?>"
