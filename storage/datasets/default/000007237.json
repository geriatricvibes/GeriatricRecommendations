	"description": "That day, it rained after school. The thin school uniform stuck to her body, outlining the lace in front of the young girl’s bosom. \n\nThe two were going home side by side in the moist ambiance of the rain when their eyes met unexpectedly. \n\nThey had already been dating for quite some time… so she couldn’t resist and had s*x with him.\n\nShe only learned later that when it came to making love with her boyfriend in private, once there was a first time, there was bound to be a second time. \n\nAt the age of 17 or 18 in senior high, when she was secretly in love and deeply moved, the sexual desire she felt just from looking at him was like the appetite during hunger; one you couldn’t suppress no matter what.\n\nWild, taciturn class monitor x gentle slender soft girl.>"
