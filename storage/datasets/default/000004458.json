	"description": "When he is plotted to lose his own career and suffer under great debts, she chooses to leave him in order not to become his burden. When his mother is diagnosed with severe illness, she chooses to sell herself out in order to raise money for her. However, when her life is being eroded little by little by her own cervical cancer, the whorehound's abuses, and her sisterly friend's betrayal, what he shows her is all his misunderstanding, contempt, and hatred. \n\nNow her hands tightly grabbing the fence, she puts her last hope on him, begging him to save her once. But what she receives is his fatal kick that makes her fall to the sea, to sharks' mouth.\n\nWill he still get the chance to be forgiven? Will she still come back to her 'murderer' again? Let's find out in the next spring.>"
