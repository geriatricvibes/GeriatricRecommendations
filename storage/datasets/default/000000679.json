	"description": "“Best Actress Xia, do you have a boyfriend?” \r\n\r\n“Best Actress Xia, do you know that Director Han wants to court you? Will you say yes to him?” \r\n\r\nXia Yishan rubbed between her eyebrows. “No, I don't know anything about that. No comment, thanks.” \r\n\r\nAs the crowd clamored on, a tiny red book fell out of Best Actor Su’s pocket. A nearby reporter picked it up. “Good heavens! It’s the marriage certificate of Su Jingting and Xia Yishan!” \r\n\r\nSu Jingting went to Xia Yishan and grabbed her round the waist. He said to the reporters who asked the questions earlier, “She doesn't have a boyfriend but a husband. Tell Han Zimo to stop dreaming.” \r\n\r\n‘Hey, hey, hey! What happened to keeping our marriage a secret?!’>"
