	"description": "#Help, my cute host got bent by the female lead, how do I fix this#\r\n\r\nLook at the title. Obviously, my adorable Susu earnestly carries out each task. But the last step would always be destroyed by the female lead. Why do the other systems’ hosts have blackened female leads who snatch male leads to play, while everytime we strategize for the male lead to meet up, the female lead would counter the strategy?!\r\n\r\nHere, I would like to ask my fellow colleagues how to let my Susu complete the task. Urgent, waiting online!\r\n\r\nAnswer: Change the task.>"
