	"description": "You have heard of something like this before, am I right? Reincarnation... I was one of them who had gone through that. Just as I thought, “Alright!!” I soon realize that there was something wrong with the body that I was reincarnated to. My clothes are tattered and I suddenly start craving for flesh. It appears that I have been reborn as a zombie. I am not able to die regardless of what I did and on top of that I have unlimited cheat ability!>"
