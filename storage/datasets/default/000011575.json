	"description": "Agatha Nobilis was the heiress of a fortune that spanned several centuries.\n\nDespite the fact that she has been married and divorced six times, if one were to choose the best bride on the continent, her name would undoubtedly come to mind. \n\n-Who will be her seventh husband? \n\nIn the midst of public interest, Agatha chose the protagonist of the ten year war, Marquis Enoch Aratus. \n\nTwenty year old. The head of a long-established family who possessed everything but wealth.\n\nHe was, however, a very attractive, excellent and well-mannered man.\n\n“There are only three things you need to do. Keep assassins at bay. Respect me as wife. Make our own separate mansion and live there.' \n\n“…..I'm not sure what kind of marriage you had thus far.”\n\nWill Agatha Nobilis, who has been embroiled in all sort of dark battles because of her astronomical fortune be able to lead a normal life now? >"
