	"description": "The name Zhao Tie Zhu (lit. Zhao Steel Pillar) sounded pretty unrefined. But, when it came to his nickname, Phantom, it could be said that everyone in the assassin societies around the world know it. Nowadays, the world was too peaceful, and because of that, the assassination business wasn’t going well. Hearing real estate could earn you good money, Zhao Tie Zhu bought a huge villa, and became the legendary landlord.\n\nHe only rented his villa to single women. Zhao Tie Zhu posted renting advertisements on a well-known social website, and with that, women all came one after the other to his villa. The prettiest in schools, the prettiest in police teams, and all sorts of beauties came into his surroundings.\n\nProclaiming himself as hegemon of campuses, unifying the underworld. All so that the tenants would live in even more content.\n\nI am a very responsible landlord — Said the Zhao Tie Zhu who was stepping on countless skeletons of the enemy.>"
