	"description": "A spoiled brat is here to seduce his man! Childhood friends to lovers.\n\nWhen Fu Shizhou was seven years old, he gained a little tail named Qiao Luo. If he were to get it removed, severe withdrawal symptoms would ensue.\n\nQiao Luo was born with the innate ability to tease and be spoiled.\n\nZhouzhou wasn’t born awkward; that developed later in life. His maturity is a lasting aftereffect of his chuuni years. He’s actually a top-tier cinnamon roll.>"
