	"description": "It seemed as if Lin Banxia was being targeted by something strange.\n\nHe was alone, but the home was full of strange noises; banging closets with nothing in them, dripping taps with no water, and strange chewing noises outside the window.\n\nUntil one night…\n\nHe woke up suddenly, and when he opened his eyes, he saw a skeleton as white as snow lying on the ceiling of his house. It turned its head, grinning at him with a brilliant smile.>"
