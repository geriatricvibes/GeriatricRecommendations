Do you want me to join your guild? Why?”\n\n“Because I need you. Why? You don’t like my guild?”\n\nSeonwoo, who is a C-class supporter, hopes not to get involved with Jehee, who is an S-class with a personality disorder but— Seonwoo receives a ring as a token of his contract.\n\n“What is this? Servant Ring? ‘Be a servant loved by your master’?”\n\n“If you’re comfortable with ‘Master’, you can call me that.”\n\nMaster? \n\nSeonwoo, who became a s*ave to Lee Jehee, wants to get out of it somehow, but—.\n\n“You’re going to misunderstand that I’m interested in you? So what if I’m really interested in you?”>"
