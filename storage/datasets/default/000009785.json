Have I gone insane or is this world insane?' \r\n\r\n'The pampered daughter of the Luo Corporation? Are you talking about the Luo Corporation, the same Luo Corporation with assets in the hundreds of billions? The boss actually has a daughter and it's Luo Qiao?' \r\n\r\n'Exactly! So what if she's fair, rich and pretty? Even so, have you forgotten that she tried to seduce a top celebrity? In the end, she's still a fair, rich and pretty girl who is cheap as hell!

It spells the end of her career as a rising female star. Following this, she falls into a depression, until... \r\n\r\n'I've decided,' Luo Qiao purses her lips and says with much difficulty, 'To return and inherit the family fortune.”>"
