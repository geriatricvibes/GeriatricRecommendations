If he rides a large kite, he can fly freely. He uses change and disguise to deceive, and controls the earth, water, fire, and wind with the Five Elements Jutsu —— It's a very all-purpose and powerful skill?!\r\n\r\n'What the hell is your magic...?'\r\n'Magic? You're wrong, it's Ninpo.' (Ninja Arts)\r\n\r\nWith powers that defy the common sense on the different worlds, Otowa brings wrath of heaven to the evil that is rampant in the world!\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, everyone, pay attention.\r\nThe secret arts of the ninja dance in this fantasy world of swords and magic, and the otherworldly ninja action is about to begin!>"
