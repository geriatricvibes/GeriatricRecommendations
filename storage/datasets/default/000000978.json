Suspecting that there is a spy among them, Ye Kai sets a trap to lure the spy out. It turns out that the spy is Shangguan Xiaoxian, who has been pretending to be dumb.\n\nIn fact, she has been planning to restore the Gold and Money Sect and succeed her father, and she intends to manipulate Ye Kai into helping her eliminate her potential rivals. >"
