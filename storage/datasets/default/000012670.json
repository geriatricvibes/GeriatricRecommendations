	"description": "The protagonist now starting his high school life, Yuuki Kousuke, loses his life upon saving another person. However, that life of his isn’t over yet.\r\n\r\nBy luck, the old man he helped is a God, and he reincarnates him in another world out of gratitude. The same way it happens in his beloved novels about other worlds, our protagonist gratefully accepts being reincarnate in another world with a cheat ability. Except, the place he wakes up in… is a morgue.\r\n\r\nWith a cheat ability that hasn’t physically changed him in the slightest, this is the story of our protagonist’s modern day revival as he lives a tranquil life.\r\n\r\n…Yet while saying this, he is getting dragged into various incidents and numerous more fights.>"
