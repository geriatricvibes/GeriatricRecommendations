	"description": "Ains, the protagonist of the story, lives in the village of Silve, where swordplay and archery play an important role, and is alone in his fascination with the possibilities of magic. However, the village of Silve lacks rich knowledge about magic and its culture. He spends his days imagining, “I wish there was such magic.” \r\n\r\nIn the middle of this time, the village of Silve is attacked. It was then that he first saw the [magic] of the enemy, which fascinated and captivated Ains amid the rubble collapsing over him. \r\n\r\nHe was the only survivor rescued from the burned village of Silve by the residents of the neighboring village of Tas. \r\n\r\nWhen Ains was pulled from the rubble, he had lost his right arm and left leg and was also blind in his right eye. \r\n\r\nDespite his physical infirmities, Ains was interested only in magic.>"
