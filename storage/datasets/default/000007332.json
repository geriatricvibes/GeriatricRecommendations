	"description": "Without any warning, and in a state where I had lost all of my memories, I was summoned to another world. And while I was rescued by some Adventurers who just happened to be there, the summoning was not the result of anyone’s plan. It was most likely just an accident. And so in order to live, I had to make a contract. But whether I liked it or not, I was pulled into incidents involving this world. My level would not go up, and I could not acquire skills. However, I would soon notice that I had a power that only I could use.>"
