	"description": "Academy City stands at the top of the science side, but there is another side - the magic side. Let us take a peek at the work of the nuns who belong to that side.\n\nFrom holding mass to proselytizing and even cleaning up after magical combat!? Agnese Sanctis's group has joined the Anglican Church and they have been given some 'odd jobs' to complete by a priest with long red hair.\n\n'We should do this first. Someone really needs to deal with it.'\n'I don't like the sound of this. I really, really don't like the sound of it.'\n'B-but they'll get mad if we don't do it. We are basically freeloaders here, so we need to do what work they give us.'\n\nGo, Agnese and friends. Show off your skills and secure yourself a home as freeloaders!>"
