However, for some reason, Hikaru didn’t die and, even though he wasn’t chosen at first, he ended up as one of the [Otherworlders that will have all their actions live broadcasted to Earth].\n\nTransferred without any preparations at all to that accursed land, he faced threats innumerable times and somehow managed to survive with his Gift, the Dark Spirit Abilities. \n\n“I must not die. I am sure the people on Earth are all rooting for me after all…” \n\nThis is the story of a young boy who is tossed about by the gazes of the viewers, yet eventually manages to raise his head and walk forward. >"
