	"description": "“I can’t believe my eyes. The ice lord actually kissed a man. God, help me!”\r\n\r\n“I’m surprised that the son of the Bai family is actually the ugly and stupid second young miss!”\r\n\r\nWho was it who melted the ice lord’s exterior and caused the awakening of his hidden gentle side?\r\n\r\nShe is black-bellied and crafty. She would never consider herself a good person, and would not go out of her way to provoke other people. But, once she is provoked, she will pay it back 1000-fold, showing no mercy.\r\n\r\nHe is cold and detached, elegant, magnanimous, and known as the ice lord, a heartless gentleman.\r\n\r\nWill sparks fly when the iceberg collides with a black-belly? Is it hopeless, or will there be excitement?>"
