	"description": "“In this life, can I fall in love once more?”\n\nAs if having your best friend steal your fiance wasn’t enough; I died by falling onto the road from an accidental push.\n\nI, who had just graduated from medical school, suddenly found my status changed by this ‘Devil-in-God-skin’ or ‘Hades’. He sent me to be reincarnated into an otome game that I once played. I found myself becoming the vampire villainess who has the doomed fate of being killed by her vampire fiancé.\n\nIf you think that this will make me surrender, then, NO WAY! No longer will this happen to me, and I will never ever let myself die because of some man.\n\nI WILL NEVER LOVE ANYONE AGAIN!!!\n\n“What?”\n\n“The captive character is feeling ill?”\n\n“It can’t be helped, I will nurse him until he is healthy again.”>"
