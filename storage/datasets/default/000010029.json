	"description": "April 2028, I’m still in the dungeon today.\n\nKaito Takagi dives into the dungeon every day instead of doing a part-time job.\n\nMob character Kaito is an explorer who hunts slime every day and could only earn a meager amount of pocket money.\n\nThe others calls me a slime slayer (LV3).\n\nIn the past, I tried to hunt goblin and I escaped for my dear life.\n\nA golden slime that I had never seen since I became a Slime Slayer (LV3) appeared, and when I kill it, a rare item called a servant card was left behind.\n\nIt is a dungeon exploration tale of a poor mob character … maybe.>"
