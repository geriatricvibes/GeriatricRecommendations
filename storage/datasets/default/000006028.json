	"description": "In order to earn enough money for his sister, Henry set out to become an adventurer. Unfortunately, because his disengage skill  was considered useless and his stats were too low, many adventurers berated him and considered him incompetent. Even when he finally managed to join a party, he was quickly dismissed. \r\n\r\nOut of desperation, Henry attempted a solo dive into a dungeon, and that was when he made a shocking discovery: Utilizing  under specific circumstances would allow him to clip through walls.\r\n\r\nOnce he clipped through the walls, he was able to bypass the dungeon boss monster and receive the clear reward. Not only that, he was able to collect the one-time clear reward an infinite number of times! \r\n\r\nBy taking advantage of this loophole, Henry has the potential to grow at breakneck speeds!\r\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, the thugs who bullied Henry and berated him as incompetent have found themselves in a sticky situation.\r\n>"
