	"description": "One of the country’s biggest projects, [Prince Love Support Team].\n\nThe mission is to fulfill the love between the prince and his heroine, a country girl of different status.\n\n Melia Rose, the country’s number one lady (but a bit dumb), is chosen to play the “villainous lady” role that’ll spice up their love. \n\nWith a group of actors such as the “Villainess’s Crony” who looks like a plain yet classy young noblewoman, the “Prince’s Crony” who’s very attractive when he takes off his glasses, the “Stalking Horse” who’s very popular with the ladies, and the “Heroine” who is bullied every day.\n\n But the relationship between the prince and the heroine doesn’t seem to be making any progress at all… \n\nWhat the hell is going on here?!>"
