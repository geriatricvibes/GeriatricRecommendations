	"description": "Shen Fe’s soul transmigrated into a person who had been like a lapping dog at a goddess’s feet, however, this goddess did not put him in her eyes at all …\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this goddess he so loved was swindled of her body and impregnated by a playboy who ran away after getting the news.\r\n\r\nFaced with this situation, the God-level System appeared and gave Shen Fei the following options:\r\n\r\n1.Listen to the goddess’s plea and be rewarded with 5 million won in cash.\r\n2.Refuse her and gain a copy of information on investment.\r\n3.Refuse her and, at the same time, make her cry and you will be rewarded with an entire office building.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing these options, Shen Fei did not give it a second thought and chose the third option.\r\n\r\nGoddess: “I am pregnant!”\r\nShen Fei, “It’s alright. I’ll raise the child after you deliver it!”\r\nGoddess: “No! You are not worthy of this child.”\r\nShen Fei: “Then I’ll change my surname to that of the child!”\r\nGoddess: “Good!”\r\n\r\nShen Fei later responsibly took care of the pregnant goddess for the coming nine months.\r\n\r\nOn the day of delivery …\r\nShen Fei ran off!!!>"
