	"description": "Yuge, a 37-year-old virgin OB/GYN, is visited by a man complaining of pain and bleeding in his lower abdomen. He is Iwamoto, a burly young carpenter.\r\n\r\nYuge is at a loss as to the cause of the bleeding. Because no matter how many tests he performs, the symptoms lead to only one possibility: 'A man with perfectly functioning ovaries and uterus.'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Iwamoto is feeling overly anxious and nervous, wondering why he is sent to an OB/GYN. Yuge recommends the guy to do an ultrasound, but...why? What is wrong with him?>"
