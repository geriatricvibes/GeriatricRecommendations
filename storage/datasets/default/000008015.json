	"description": "It begins on the mountain.\n\nWith the glint of a knife, a flash of steel in the hands of a sworn brother. A betrayal.\n\nStabbed and pushed down the mountain, Zi Chen  lied within the red-stained snow, left to die.\n\nThis is where it begins; he is given life by lightning, \nbaptized by thunder.\n\nThose who had once betrayed him should all suffer in his cruel revenge.>"
