	"description": "I’m a princess?\r\n\r\nLucia Arpegio was the most powerful wizard ever.\r\n\r\nHowever, she abandoned all of her power and duty because she was a terribly greedy woman, and ran away at night with her best-looking gardener.\r\n\r\nAnd their daughter is me!\r\n\r\nStrong mana is the evidence of noble blood and pride.\r\n\r\nBut in the Empire, the wizard’s blood is gradually disappearing.\r\n\r\nWith such symptoms, Duke Arpegio, the head of the four great dukes of the Empire, has suggested that I could become a member of the Arpegios if I could prove my powerful mana.\r\n\r\nBut I can’t please other nobles with the common blood flowing in me. Ignoring, cold, contempt, bullying… I aimed for a life of being a noble spirit and to live leisurely, but the path is difficult.\r\n\r\n…Isn’t it too much where my life is threatened?\r\n\r\n“You’re going to treat me as a dangerous person to the point where I could be eliminated, but you’re a dangerous person yourself. How does that suit morality?”\r\n\r\nI’m at the end of my rope.\r\n\r\nIt was you who reached me when I wanted to live a nice and quiet life.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, I will take this duke!>"
