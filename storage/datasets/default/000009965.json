	"description": "This is the story of a Kantas couple’s successful efforts to lay (steal) eggs:\n\n“… You stole it?” Black’s expression tensed as he cautiously lowered his body, using his wings to conceal the nest more tightly.\n\n“I didn’t steal–” Listening to Black’s question, White’s expression became prouder. He stuffed the large white egg beneath his butt as he replied excitedly, “I laid it!”\n\nBoom– Black seemed to have heard the sound of a string known as rationality snapping in his head.\n\nHe finally knew what was more infuriating than a husband leaving home for half a year only to come back with a wife three months pregnant. Which was–\n\nA wife leaving home for a few days to find out that his husband had laid an egg!\n\nThe story’s protagonist → Meng Jiuzhao (crying) : I am that egg.>"
