And on his wedding day, she could only give them her best wishes in tears.\n\nHe greeted her, holding his bride’s hand, as if she was just an embarrassed stranger. And that was the moment when she finally realised that the only bond between them was their contractual relationship, which had nothing to do with love.\n\nHowever, when their agreement was about to expire, he started acting like an enraged beast at the sight of her receding figure. “Things are never, ever gonna end between the two of us!”>"
