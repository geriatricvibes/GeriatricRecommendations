	"description": "Xiang Ye (Ah Ye) and Charles have the fated arrangement of master and servant. In the depths of darkness, Ah Ye scooped up Charles – a vampire butler. Possessing a fervid passion for service, Charles single-mindedly attends to the secretive young master Ah Ye – regardless of his ferocious appetite, abhorrent taste in clothing, and relationship failings – for the master is always right.\n\nOn the other hand, in the chaotic era of scientifically enhanced humans, powerful heroes become the protectors of normal citizens, going where evil needs subduing. This young master may be secretive, but he is our hero.>"
