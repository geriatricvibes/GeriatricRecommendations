	"description": "She is the underworld Ghost Doctor’s only disciple, who accidentally transmigrated into the body of the main wife’s daughter in the general’s mansion. She used to be a punching bag. Now, she stepped on her dregs of an older sister, put her father’s concubine in her place, and teaches any objectionable aristocratic ladies a lesson. \n\nHer days are rather free and unfettered. But when did that cold as ice prince from the rumors, sporting a deadpan face all day long, fix his gaze on her?\n\nHe unexpectedly fawned and pandered to her like a devoted dog?\n\n“Go away, you rotten man! Careful or I’ll needle you like a pin cushion!”\n\n“Wife, why are you so fierce? As a husband, I’m so scared”\n\n….the man is all smiles as he approached, his eyes gleaming with a cunning light.>"
