	"description": "Due to a nuclear war caused by a global energy crisis, a nuclear winter had befallen the world. The lucky survivors had been forced to live in underground shelters.\r\n\r\nBut the resources underground were still limited. For the humans to return back above ground as soon as possible, a full dive game named Wasteland Code Survival was forcefully promoted among all the underground shelters.\r\n\r\nThe game perfectly simulated all the possible situations above ground, radiation, hunger, monsters… Players will find themselves in various life-threatening situations, but players will only have three chances to revive themselves.\r\n\r\nOnce a player has spent all their chances, their resources in real life will be taken away by the shelter’s system. Food, water… even oxygen.\r\n\r\n“Hello, I am Player 9527, how much is this Power Armor?>"
