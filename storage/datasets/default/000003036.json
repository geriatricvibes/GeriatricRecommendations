	"description": "Hiromichi Sato has been dating Haruka for a month, and their relationship is quickly heading in a good direction.\r\n\r\nBut one day Hiromichi’s parent announces they’re remarrying and he’ll be getting a new step-sister. When he meets her, he’s shocked to see that she looks exactly like Haruka. No worries, though — they’re totally different people.
