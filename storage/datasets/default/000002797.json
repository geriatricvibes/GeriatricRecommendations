	"description": "After being summoned to another world, [Sage] Kagehiko Kurono succeeded in defeating the Demon King together with the hero party.\r\n\r\nHe was promised that he would be returned to Japan after defeating the Demon King, but what the hero party was given upon their return was an unreasonable demand from the king.\r\n\r\n“I don't have to work for this country anymore. I will do as I please.”\r\n\r\nWhen the king tried to break his promise, Kagehiko told him straight out.\r\n\r\n“I'm quitting my job as a [Sage] and becoming a [Thief]!”\r\n\r\nA man who has mastered magic as a [Sage] is reborn as a fearless and unpredictable [Thief]!\r\n\r\nIn a world of swords and magic, the greatest thief of all time flies through the night sky in search of treasures!>"
