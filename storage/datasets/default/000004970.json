	"description": "The Daoist Lord Xie Wuwang has peerless beauty, top notch cultivation, and holds influence over the three realms. He is known as the ruler of the world.\n\nThose enamoured with his beauty are countless.\n\nEverybody knows there are no feelings between him and his daoist companion, Ning Qingqing. He stays with her only because of the many years they’ve spent together. It was simply like how he had no need to throw away his swords or magical treasures.\n\nThat was, until the day he killed her mushroom.\n\nThat was the only gift he gave her. The last bit of warmth in her heart.\n\nShe gave up completely, deciding to let go.\n\nThat night, thrown into turmoil by her feelings, she took herself to be that dead mushroom.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time she used divorce to threaten him.\n\nXie Wuwang thought Ning Qingqing would calm down after a night’s sleep and regret it just like before, finding some excuse to pretend yesterday never happened.\n\nBut he never expected that instead of finding an excuse, he would find a plot of damp soil where she buried herself with only her head poking above the ground…\n\nXie Wuwang: “?!?!”>"
