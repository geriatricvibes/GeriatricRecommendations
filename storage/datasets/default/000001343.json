	"description": "“I mustn’t die before I finish this book!!”\r\n\r\nOne day, I unexpectedly died in the hands of these robbers and somehow I, the bookworm, ended up being resurrected… as a dog. Why a dog! How am I supposed to read like this! In the midst of my troubled thoughts, I saw this girl who believes that scissors are weapons——Natsuno Kirihime. She seemed pretty dangerous to me, but at least she understands my dog-talk. Apparently she’s secretly my favourite author, Akiyama Shinobu!? What should I do? And where are the robbers who killed me——!?>"
