	"description": "Durarara!! is about a number of unusual people who gather in Ikebukuro, Tokyo--- a youth who yearns for an un-mundane life, a hoodlum, a stalker denpa-girl, a young man who deals in information ?for fun?, a black-market doctor, a high-schooler obsessed with magic, as well as a ?headless rider? riding a bike painted black.\r\n\r\nThese unusual people begin a series of abnormal stories that never fail to create headaches. But, although their personalities are all twisted? they still talk about love.\r\n\r\nNote: A sequel novel series 'Durarara!! SH' began in 2014.>"
