	"description": "I’m a high school student who became an author after debuting at Dengeki Bunko. After taking a year of hiatus from school to write my work, I transferred out to another high school to study, and met a girl called Eri Nitadori in school, a rookie voice actress cast as a character in the anime adaptation of my work.\n\nIn school, we treat our professions as a secret. However, Nitadori’s very popular in class, and I’m a loner…the only chance we get to talk to each other is when we take the Limited Express train together every Thursday, seated side by side as we head off for an anime, After Recording.\n\nTo improve her skills, she asked me questions regarding the profession. While I was answering the questions regarding the process–how did it end up like this.\n\nThis is what I last remembered before I lost consciousness, and the story of my near-death experience.>"
