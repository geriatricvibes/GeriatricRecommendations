	"description": "Hundreds of years have passed since the threat known as Kihei suddenly emerged and laid waste the world. To combat this threat, humanity established a school of magic, Twilight Academy. Ever since then, the battle between Kihei and humanity has raged on day and night. \n\nOn one fateful day, Kaguro Kou, a member of the Department of Magic Research, journeyed to a particular ruin to retrieve a Kihei corpse. Unfortunately, his life ended there…or should’ve, until a Kihei girl saved him―\n\n“Greetings, my love―my name is Shirahime. From here on, I shall be by your side forever.”\n\nLike a knight in a story, like a princess in a fairy tale, the awakened maiden made a vow to Kou. However, he is unaware of the never-ending hell that will soon ensue―\n\nA touching dark fantasy of hope and despair from Keishi Ayasato, author of Torture Princess!>"
