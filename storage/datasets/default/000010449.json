	"description": "'The fourth primogenitor' - That's the world's strongest vampire that should only exist in legends. Accompanied even by twelve Kenjuu and spreading calamity, this phantom vampire appeared in Japan.\r\n\r\nFor the observation and obliteration of this 'fourth primogenitor', the government and Lion King decided to dispatch an attack mage referred as a 'swords shaman'. However, for some reason, the one chosen for the observation was an apprentice 'swords shaman' girl, Himeragi Yukina.\r\n\r\nWielding the strongest anti-primogenitor spirit spear, Yukina arrived at Demon Sanctuary, 'Itogami City'. What was the true identity of the 'fourth primogenitor', Akatsuki Kojou, she encountered over there!?>"
