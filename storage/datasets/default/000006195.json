	"description": "Due to God’s mistake Yamato died. When asked by the Goddess with no believers in another world what kind of skill that he wants he said “I want my skill to be something that wouldn’t let me stand out, while it’s easy to use so I can earn money using it” While hoping to live a small and peaceful life in another world. The Goddess reluctantly agreed, and Yamato decided to live an ordinary life as the only believer of the Goddess in another world.\n\n​However when he was insulted and belittled he couldn’t take it anymore so he decided to fight up until the bitter end.\n\n“Anyways all I can do is to make potions.”\n\nWhy are the people misunderstand the intentions of Yamato?\n\nHow did that happen?　\n\n“I said I want a skill that is fun to use and can earn me money!”>"
