	"description": "In the distant, but not too distant future, the profession of book author has disappeared. Every member of society is legally obligated to publish one book during their lifetime, but a second work is prohibited. Every book for sale in a bookstore is the one and only published work of someone. \n\nThis is the story of a boy who keeps his words close to his heart and a girl who is in love with the art of storytelling.>"
