	"description": "“When everyone scorned me because I was merely a woman, I kept convincing myself: ‘Actually, you can give it a try.’” – Fang Feng Sheng\n\n…\n\nThere was a famous saying in officialdom: there is no yamen without Shaoxing. \n\nShe was the only descendant of the Fang family, the most prominent family of private advisors in Shaoxing. \n\nA calamity broke the Fang family apart. Her father was implicated and put to death, and she cut her way through thistles and thorns to prove her name. \n\nHowever, walking down this path, she discovered that there were things beyond her imagination.\n\n~ ~\n\nZong Yue knows that he could marry Fang Feng Sheng because he had blocked all her paths of retreat. But it doesn’t matter—one day, the person will become his, and so will her heart.>"
