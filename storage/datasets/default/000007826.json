	"description": "Pure white fine salt and white sugar, comfortable cotton clothes and other merchandise, filled up all of Black Rock Tribe’s warehouses; beautifully and delicately crafted commodities of YiWu blinded the eyes’ of several tribal chiefs that had come to trade. Carrot-sized ginseng and massive ferocious beasts were all exchanged for bags of salt and white sugar, and a few other goods. Both sides were extremely happy regarding this kind of trade.\r\n\r\nMaster NiuXu lazily leant against his fur-coated throne, standing below him was a robust tribal warrior; He thought ‘They are getting more and more audacious recently since America and Europe are backing their Genesis Warrior. It is time to hire a few Totem warriors.’\r\n\r\nA dimensional travel novel set in a post apocalypse world with genetically enhanced humans where our poor mc, Niu Xu, accidentally discovered a way to travel to the primordial age. Furthermore, he can travel back and fourth between both worlds.>"
