	"description": "One day, swamps appeared all around the world. Mobs of monsters lurked within these swamps. Hunters earned wealth and honor from hunting these creatures down. As a result, this occupation became the number one profession which everyone admired and sought after.\r\n\r\nAhn Jiwoo is a Hunter who had a late awakening. He was fired from his company, he broke up with his girlfriend, and he amassed an enormous debt after saving somebody. He believed his life would pick up and blossom from here on out.\r\n\r\n“But why are my skills weird?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the point of being a hunter?! When my stats are so… Trash!”\r\n\r\nThe journey of the lowest ranked Hunter climbing the ranks and saving the world begins now.>"
