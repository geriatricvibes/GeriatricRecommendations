	"description": "My 10 year old daughter said she wanted to have a birthday party. On that day, her classmates came to congratulate her. She should have had a good time. But... time passed and her daughter became a middle school student. By chance, I reunite with the woman who was her homeroom teacher at the time and learns the truth about her.\r\n\r\n'Congratulations' for her birthday. And the word 'thank you'.\r\nI wrote this story with special thoughts on these words.>"
