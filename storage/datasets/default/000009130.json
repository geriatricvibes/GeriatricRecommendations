	"description": "'A baby girl was born!'\r\n\r\nI started my 100th life again.\r\n\r\nOh, my God. I didn't want to be reborn anymore because I always had a terrible life. But this time the Duke is a little weird?\r\n\r\n'Can't you show us your smiling face?'\r\n\r\n'I made a knight's order for my baby!'\r\n\r\nWhy does my family love me so much? But there's a lot of kids trying to get close to my family. So I cleaned up the area.\r\n\r\n'Did you think you could touch my daughter and survive?'\r\n\r\nMy parents were angels only in front of me. They were relentless with the bad guys. I paid a lot of attention to the heir of the Grand Duke.\r\n\r\n'Don't you like me?'\r\n\r\nWhy is he so into me?\r\n\r\n'I think I'm going to die because you're so cute.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think I'm going to let you go?'\r\n>"
