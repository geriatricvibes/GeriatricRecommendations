	"description": "Mel, a doctor assigned to an expeditionary unit, who agonizes over the disgusting taste of the preserved food she is given.\n\nThe bread is sour and stony. The dried meat is tasteless and odorless and impossible to chew. This doctor, remembering that her life is in danger, stands alone.\n\nThis is the story of an elf girl, Mel, who struggles to use her knowledge and experience of forest life to eat a good meal on her expedition.>"
