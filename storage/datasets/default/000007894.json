In other people’s eyes, the me who wasn’t able to cultivate was trash.\r\n\r\nI didn’t mind being called trash as long as his Immortal Lord loved me.\r\n\r\nBut not only did he not love me, he even wanted to gouge out half of my soul to nourish his little lover.\r\n\r\nHis Immortal Lord’s arch-enemy was a little highness in the demon realm, known for being a scoundrel in all three realms. He was treacherous and ruthless in nature, and whenever interest struck him, he would take up his sword and go to the spiritual pool to massacre evil ghosts.\r\n\r\nBut when I was in a tight spot, the fiendish little prince in everyone’s eyes would exasperatedly bully me while helping me wipe my tears.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nTo say something completely tasteless, I love him.\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nStrong overbearing protective gong x beautiful but pitiful shou\r\nXianxia redemption story\r\nWritten in first person narrative>"
