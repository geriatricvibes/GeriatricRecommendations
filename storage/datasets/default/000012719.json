	"description": "Hari, who died in an unexpected car accident, had come to her senses after being reincarnated into a completely different world. Am I the daughter of the Emperor? Or the Duke's daughter? Hari, who opened her eyes with a throbbing heart, was in shock. I'm a dog? A dog that can talk, too? And it gets worse! I was the hunting dog of a cruel emperor who exterminated his own relatives to ascend to the throne.\r\n\r\nNow that it's done, I have to find a way to live. The only thing this little doggy could do with her body was…\r\n\r\n'I'll pay you back if you raise me, Your Majesty!'\r\n\r\n'Alright, I'll take you.'\r\n\r\n'That's a great choice, Your Majesty. You’ll never regret it!'\r\n\r\nGoodbye to my self-esteem— A dog's way to utmost power... that's the route I’ll take! My second life will be as the Emperor's adviser and potential successor.\r\n\r\nUntil the day of death! >"
