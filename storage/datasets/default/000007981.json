	"description": "Anakin Skywalker once called as Darth Vader, whose name once shook the entire galaxy is now dying. His last moments were spent repenting and finishing his work as The Chosen One.\n\nThe Jedi Order is recovering, the Rebels are reorganizing the Republic and Siths are no more.\n\nBut his only wish is too once again meet his wife, Padme.\n\nHe can feel her soul in one corner of the Galaxy. She has been reborn. And so Anakin starts a new journey. A journey to find his one true love.\n\nBut it’s not as simple as it seems. The planet he has been born on is different. Wizards secretly hide and go by their daily tasks. They use pointy sticks to control force and apparently they still haven’t mastered interplanetary travel. On the other hand the planet has Jedi Ruins, two mad dark Wizard who go by the name of Dark Lord\n\nAnd he needs to go to school.\n\nApparently, life as Darth Vader was far more simpler.>"
