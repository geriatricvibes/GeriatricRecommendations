	"description": "Rosha Lewen, an extremely ordinary girl.\r\nOne day, a half-human monster, Ramia, invaded the village, and all her life was taken away.\r\n\r\n“#777, did you wake up?”\r\n\r\nThe moment Rosha opened her eyes after the pain of death, she was in the ‘Golden Dawning’, which was called a pseudo group , that greeted Rosha.\r\n\r\nKnights to protect the Son of God who will save the world, Rostelier.\r\n\r\nRosha was saved from them and became Rosha Rostelier.\r\n\r\nWhat remained for Rosha was a feeling of guilt for surviving alone, a tenacity to find her younger sister who may be alive, and…\r\n\r\n“… … I will tear them to death. All of those monsters, all without exception.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing but anger.>"
