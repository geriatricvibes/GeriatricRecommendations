	"description": "Lu Wanwan transmigrated inside a melodramatic and rich-businessman-type novel called The Rich Young Master’s Gentle Love. In the original novel, the eldest young miss of the Lu family was a one-hundred percent white lotus, she despised the male lead Shen Yi for having neither money nor influence, she forced him to divorce her and after their divorce, she cruelly crushed him under her feet.\n\nWho knew that after dumping Shen Yi, he would have such a fast meteoric rise? Shen Yi, that man, was bloody, ruthless and tyrannical. His temper was bad, he would take revenge for any small grievance and held grudge like a mad demon.\n\nLu Wanwan, who just transmigrated, cautiously and diligently, tried to win his favor in order to avoid the series of seeking-death acts of the original novel.\n\nThe first time, she was locked up by the male lead.\n\nThe second time she was locked-up again by the male lead!\n\nThe third time, Lu Wanwan decided she was going to be a greedy, vain, fake and unreasonable white lotus!\n\nTo hell with currying favor.\n\nDivorce! She wants to divorce Shen Yi.>"
