	"description": "I got bitten by a crazy dog. I can’t run away anywhere else, for the rest of my life.\n\nThe hero of war was a crazy dog.\n\nThe Priest Dialin had to make him apt for a social debut by turning this crazy dog assigned to her into a young master.\n\nHowever… …\n\nLet alone raising him up as a respected young master, the problem was with turning him into a person.\n\nA human who has all three of ‘crazy’, ‘bad’, and ‘bastard’ is not meant to be spoken to.\n\n“Calm down!”\n\n“Stay still!”\n\nDialin took care of Ceres with all her might, looking only at the promised promotions and benefits.….\n\n“Stay by my side.”\n\n“Feed me.”\n\n“I don’t like it if it’s not Dialin.”\n\n As a result,\n\nThe crazy dog, which she finally made into a human filled with childishness, stubbornness and recklessness, began to burn with obsession.>"
