If there’s a problem, its that i’m facing the death flag all the time?\n\n “Is this a way of you asking me to end you?” My lion dad, Eden LionHeart, who seems to lack something for a long time. I decided to survive by a bloodless beast. I’m going to train my male father! *\n\n “How dare you make my emergency food cry?” Did he like the cat fishing rod I made last month? Or because the churros I made last last month were so good? Something is wrong with my dad. \n\n“Get out of my sight right now. I’m the only one who can pick on our emergency food.” Dad. Is this another death flag?…?>"
