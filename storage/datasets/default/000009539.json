	"description": "Song Ran is an illustrator for children’s books. He has pastel arts, a pastel personality, and a pastel life. One day, he met four-years-old Bubu. Bubu and his father, who has an A+ for success, wealth, and looks, but a F- for childcare, stumble into Song Ran’s world just like that. When fairy tales meet a lonely child, when warm-toned 8012A meets cool-toned 8012B; this is a story about family and love.>"
