	"description": "I transmigrated into an otome game. The problem was I didn’t possess the heroine, Naila, but the villainess, Claudia. And just like any other villain, Claudia’s social reputation was the worst.\n\n“Don’t go overboard. I know you can’t stand seeing your sister getting praised, but if you do more than this, it’ll only make you look ugly.”\n\n…My real brother despised me.\n\n“Tsk, I hope you understand that you have no chance. When will you realize that it won’t work no matter how desperate you are.”\n\n….My fiance treated me like a stalker.\n\nIf this continued, I would die unjustly at the guillotine because of the sins I did not commit.\n\nTherefore, in order to get help from the cursed prince, I offered him a fake marriage.\n\n“I don’t want a poor fake marriage like this. If you’re going to do it, it certainly means that we need to uphold all the responsibilities as a married couple. I’m talking about outside and inside the bedroom.”>"
