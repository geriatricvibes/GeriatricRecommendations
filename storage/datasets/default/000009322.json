	"description": "I became possessed in a R19 novel. My brother is the mad\r\nEmperor of Aragon and I am the villainess and his half sister\r\nwho is also a supporting character, Isabella Belucci.\r\n\r\nI thought I’d go back to the original world if I died, so I decided to go out of my way to rebel and get executed by Richard’s hands.\r\nBut…\r\n\r\n“Why? Why did I not go back?!”\r\n\r\nInstead, let’s change the goal this time and safely make Richard the emperor. Then, my path will be a happy ending!\r\n…With that thought, I stole the heroine’s route.\r\n\r\n“Does Sasha really think she’s my sister?”\r\n\r\nWhy does the male lead claim I’m not his sister?\r\n\r\n“Sasha is like a snowflake.”\r\n\r\nIs the second male lead also clinging to me?\r\n\r\nThe novel seems to began recognizing me as the heroine.>"
