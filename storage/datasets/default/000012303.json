	"description": "I was the youngest princess in the Imperial family. The powerless imperial family was engulfed in the flames of rebellion, and as an extra in the family, I was the first to be abandoned. As such, I lived not as the imperial princess Stella, but as the commoner Ethel for ten years. That was, until I came back to the imperial family that abandoned me.\n\n“I need a replacement.”\n\n So said my sister, the first princess of the empire. \n\n“To be a substitute for my missing sister.”\n\n“A tempting proposition, Your Highness. But I don’t want to.” \n\n“Is there nothing you cherish…?” \n\nA clear threat holding my family hostage. And so I returned to the imperial family as “my own substitute”, laughing at them for not recognizing me.\n\n***\n\nThere is one perfect ending to this skit. I won’t forgive them. They strove to win the heart of the princess who had awakened her powers, but finally she abandoned them. With that ending, I will be happy.>"
