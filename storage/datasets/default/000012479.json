	"description": "This is the third time I have lived my life unable to save the emperor as the imperial physician.\nTired of having to coax the damn emperor every time, Serena decided to take action. \nFor once, I’m going to perfectly regenerate that incurable burn.\n\n“What conditions were you talking about?”\n“Let me touch you, Your Majesty.”\n\nThat way, I’ll be able to see if I can treat you or not.\n\n*\n\n“What are you doing?”\n“What do you mean, don’t you remember our terms?”\n“Well, for the treatment…”\n“Yes, it’s for the treatment.”\n“This is the treatment?”\n\nAfter many ups and downs, the emperor’s lackadaisical mindset and indolent lifestyle were returned to normal. Also, is it just me or are the emperor’s eyes getting hotter and hotter?\n\n“Rena, why does my heart pound when I see you?”\n“You have arrhythmia.”\n\nWhy is he suddenly doing this? He didn’t do this before, but he kept lovingly whispering, telling me to stay with him.\n\n“Stay with me, Serena. I’ve become so desperate for you.”\n\nI was just about to leave, but the Emperor suddenly started treating me so nicely!>"
