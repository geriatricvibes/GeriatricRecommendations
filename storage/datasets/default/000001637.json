Every time she pleased the young master Gu, she got humiliated in every possible way.\n\nDue to the sentence young master Gu has said in school: “A fiancee?

Opening her eyes again, Su Cheng returned to the day when she was picked up by the Gu family.\n\nPlease? The one that does that doesn’t exist anymore. Su Cheng just wants to study hard and make money so the sooner she achieve economic independence, she can leave the Gu family and stay away from Gu Cheng.>"
