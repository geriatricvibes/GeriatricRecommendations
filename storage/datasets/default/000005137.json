	"description": "\r\nNatasha is an experienced divorce attorney.\r\n\r\nAnd for some reason, this empire was overflowing with couples who wanted to divorce for various reasons.\r\n\r\nFor example, a husband who suddenly becomes obsessed with a wife or a wife who suddenly wants to get a divorce.\r\n\r\nThanks to this, Natasha was making a sizable profit by helping them.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when claiming alimony or part of property division as a fee, it was almost like sitting on a cushion of money.\r\n\r\n'Which lawyer would refuse this?'\r\n\r\nNatasha hummed inwardly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“...Miss Estelle. Lawyers are always on the side of their clients.”\r\n\r\nThe words that came out with a face that were not impressed were very emotional. When Estelle made a face that she couldn't believe, Natasha continued.\r\n\r\n“To be precise, I’m on the side of those who give me money.”\r\n\r\n“That’s better.”\r\n\r\n“Honesty is also a basic skill of a lawyer.”\r\n>"
