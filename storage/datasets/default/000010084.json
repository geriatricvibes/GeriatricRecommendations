	"description": "My name is Qin Jue. At only 16 years of age, I’m already the youngest person to ever become an uncle-grandmaster in the Xuanyi Mountain Sect.\r\nAlso, I’m the strongest being in this entire world!\r\nBut unlike other transmigrators, I want nothing to do with the outside world and wish to live a leisurely life on a cliff behind the sect, sipping wine and singing songs.\r\nThat is until one day, a mysterious girl appears in front of my yard…\r\nJoin Qin Jue as he deals with sneaky sects and greedy, hostile clans, all while raising a “weed” to sentience and creating heaven-defying spirit-energy “guns”.>"
