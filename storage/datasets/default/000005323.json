	"description": "“Art thou the Sword Saint Alice’s master, the Grand Sword Saint Takumi?”\n\n“Huh, wait, I think you’ve got the wrong person?”\n\nAfter I was kicked out from my adventurer party, I lived out my retirement in the mountains.\n\nHowever, my disciple became the strongest human in the world without my knowledge, which started the rumor that her master could only be the ultimate strongest person, eclipsing humanity. Hence, I now occupied rank one on the adventurer’s rankings.\n\nAn aspiring student, a dragon, a hero, and a demon lord all came flocking to me, completely misunderstanding everything.\n\nPlease stop.\n\nI’m just a small fry, okay?\n\nThis is not a story about an OP MC.\n\nIt’s a comedy about a bunch of idiots who think I am.>"
