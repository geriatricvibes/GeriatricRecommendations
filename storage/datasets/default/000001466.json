	"description": "Zhang Ran was reborn in 1967 in this parallel world very similar to his previous life with memories of his previous life.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 1990, Zhang Ran finished his overseas business trip and returned to China on a luxury cruise ship with full expectation and joy.\r\n\r\nAfter the cruise ship traveled through a cloud of fog, Zhang Ran discovered that the time was directly in 2018, and their cruise ship had arrived 28 years later.\r\n\r\n‘Overnight’, Zhang Ran’s originally lonely account suddenly added sons, daughters-in-law, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters.>"
