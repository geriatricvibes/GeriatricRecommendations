	"description": "In order to emancipate himself from slavery, Chen Xiao has worked hard, trying to break through the Skin Refining Realm and become a real martial artist. Another reason for him to work hard is that he wants to take revenge on Manager Wang for killing his parents. As soon as Manager Wang learns of his plan, he immediately captures Chen Xiao and destroys his cultivation base. Chen Xiao lies on the ground and closes his eyes in despair. At this moment, the jade pendant on his chest starts talking, 'Do you want power?' Shocked, he wonders if this is the best chance he has for revenge.>"
