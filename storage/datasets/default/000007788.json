	"description": "“Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” -Matthew 7:14\r\n\r\nGuomen, 過門/过门, meaning marriage in Chinese. If explained literally, it means going past the gates/door-a reference to the Bible(see above).\r\n\r\n“Through the Strait Gates”: to me, it’s the best way to explain it.\r\n\r\nThe gate’s narrow, the road small for them.\r\n\r\nTheir past and future interwoven into a tangled, messed up web.\r\n\r\nThirteen years of sour and bittersweet memories. And seven years in between that washed out everything they had like water, leaving only stark, plain, throbbing dullness.>"
