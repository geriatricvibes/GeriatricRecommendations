	"description": "It's 1935, the protagonist TS reincarnated into a royal princess who doesn’t exist in history. In a chaotic time where militarism has gained momentum in Japan, Sakurako struggles to avoid historical events from her previous world, as she is swept away by the surrounding tensions from this current era... \n\nCan Sakurako-san really save Japan from suffering defeat by drawing childish illustrations of important technologies and using her position as the most influencial person in Japan by acting like an idol?\n\nIt’s a story about such a thing. Probably.>"
