	"description": "He is a Xian, yet surpasses Gods. She is a God, yet cannot compare even to a Xian.\n\nJade Pool sinks during the Jade Pool Xian Gathering; that first sunset they meet,  his unparalleled beauty and talent she sees. Thereupon, feelings bud. Their meeting, as though acquainting. All that is hateful is, falling for the wrong person.\n\nSeeking, by every means, where feelings are, yet upon turning around suddenly, frustration has pervaded! How to blame, how to hate, it is fate that dictates!\n\nLove and hate coils in foolish tangles; it is all but a dream. Exactly how formidable will she become, and what emotional burdens will she carry?\n\nShe is the Goddess above the Ninth Heaven, yet destined to be renounced; divine powers and her are not meant to be. Behind her elder sister’s brilliance, she, forever, is only her shadow, an exploitable presence.\n\nA person like her, too, desires to be treated sincerely, even if for a moment, to be herself—Yin Luo.>"
