	"description": "Question: What is it like to be romantically pursued by the main subject of a very conventional scary urban legend?\n\nYao Ye, the only normal person inside a bizarre horror story: I am going crazy.\n\nWhen you’re going about your day as usual and suddenly find out that the guy who had a crush on you that you ignored has become a ghost lingering behind you late at night…\n\nWhen you suddenly find out that your boyfriend is a monster in human skin…\n\nWhen you hear about a netizen committing suicide because of an online relationship breakup and suddenly find out that it was you who dumped him…\n\nWhen you’re stranded on a deserted island and suddenly find out that your dead childhood friend has become a bandage-wearing weirdo hunting down intruders on the island…\n\nWhen you suddenly find out that your lover is not human.\n\n—It loves you to the bone, and you can’t escape it.\n\nIn the end, their karma is inextricably tangled together.\n\nThis is a story that turns an eerie urban legend into a romantic drama.>"
