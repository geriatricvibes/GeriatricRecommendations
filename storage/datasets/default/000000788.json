(By Sayuri)\r\n\r\n'To be more girly, that's why I want to be Nii-san's little sister!' (By Yuuki)\r\n\r\n'If Mii-chan becomes Nii-chama's little sister, she will become rich right?' (By Mika)\r\n\r\nThe little sisters who were presented to him had more than one or two odd quirks, a slapstick comedy between siblings starts here!>"
