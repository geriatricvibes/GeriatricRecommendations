	"description": "For the world to function and sustain, it has to be inevitability built on hierarchy. As precious, rare resources, high-grade omegas are kept in captivity by powerful, elite alphas in order to reproduce the next high quality generation.\n\nYan Yi, a lop-eared rabbit omega, had once ravaged the battlefield with the powerful peregrine falcon alpha Lu Shangjin, had once loved him deeply, and had once tasted his heartlessness.\n\nNow, he could only succumb to the social order and submit to his subordinate nature.>"
