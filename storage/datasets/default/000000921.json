	"description": "Ye Yu transmigrated into a self-cultivation novel.\r\n\r\nTwice.\r\n\r\nAfter her second transmigration, she became the evil female side lead of the novel.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a tragic ending, Ye Yu decided to stay away from the devil-like male lead. But she transmigrated over at an awkward time...\r\n\r\nTherefore, the second day after Ye Yu transmigrated over, news spread in the devil world- The Demon King had just gotten married last night and got kicked out of the palace by the Devil Queen.\r\n\r\nDemon officials: How bad must the Devil King's skills be?\r\n\r\nDemon King: ...\r\n\r\nAfter that-\r\n\r\nYe Yu said: Don’t come over! I am really not the female lead! Male lead, you have gotten the wrong person!>"
