	"description": "My husband wasn’t just a mere magician, but he is the Master of the Magic Tower. I didn’t know that fact.\n\nI wasn’t just a mere dimension shifter, but someone with eternal youth and immortality. My husband didn’t know that fact.\n\nI was killed by a bomb that suddenly exploded in the village, and I woke up 10 years after that. And the news that came to my ears was that the Master of the Magic Tower had gone mad and had been on a rampage for 10 years.\n\nI get it that he doesn’t know I’m alive, but what’s up again with him being crazy?>"
