	"description": "Doom!\r\n\r\nOne day, I became the daughter of Lucellai, the villainess in a novel. She, who fails to kill the Empress, ends up with a terrible death in the future!\r\n\r\nI don’t know anything else, but I must prevent the terrible death from happening. \r\n\r\nSo I started to stop her evil deeds behind without Lucellai’s knowledge. \r\n\r\nWhen I thought I was doing really well...  \r\n\r\n“You’re the only one I have. Even if you tell me to lie down at your feet, I will gladly obey you.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince, who should never be involved with me, comes boldly, revealing his affection. \r\n\r\nEven my mother, Lucellai, who seemed to think of me as consumable goods, began to show harsh but clumsy affection to me.  >"
