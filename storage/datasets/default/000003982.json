	"description": "Celebrity of the Xenomium Academy.\n\nAll female students like him.\n\nFelix Berg.\n\nRecently, there has been a person that annoys him.\n\nLucy Keenan, just one year lower.\n\nThe girl, who has a very unremarkable appearance and a calm personality, is the only one who can distinguish Felix from his identical twin Adrian like a ghost.\n\nWhenever she meets him, she only has an expressionless face.\n\nBut when she meets Adrian, she smiles brightly.\n\nWhen he is with her, her lips are shut.\n\nAnd she only talks with Adrian.\n\nIt is certain.\n\nLucy Keenan has a crush on his twin brother Adrian.\n\nAs his curiosity for Lucy Keenan grows, Felix begins to question her. He has the same face, the same height, and the same voice, so why is it Adrian and not him?\n\nIt’s a bonus that I wanted to interrupt Lucy Keenan’s unrequited love for nothing.>"
