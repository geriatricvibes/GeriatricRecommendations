	"description": "Transmigrated into a xuanhuan Patriarch, this novel portrays the xuanhuan world as realistically as possible from the perspective of the Wang clan. \n\nThere’s planting spiritual fields, raising spiritual fish, and the comprehensive development of various family industries. The Patriarch also raises salted fish elders (people who have no intention of doing anything) to become ancestors who assumed roles of protective umbrellas while inspiring his juniors to brave The Holy Land Palace of Learning in order to excel.\n\nThis is not a hot-blooded combat-style xuanhuan, although there are strategic battles. Instead, it focuses on the promotion of various family industries, capital, facilities, family servants, family generals, clansmen, guests, in-laws, and other important elements. It tries to look at the 'old-fashioned' xuanhuan world from a fresh perspective.>"
