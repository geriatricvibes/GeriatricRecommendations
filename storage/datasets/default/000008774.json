	"description": "Apparently, I’ve been reincarnated as a villain in an otome game. That’s all well and good, but what do you mean I was killed by the love interest before the main story? On top of that, Hilda-san is the “shotacon” Queen and all I see are death flags!\n\nIt’s a story about a girl who was reincarnated as Hilda, the villain who caused the Hero of the otome game to become yandere due to the trauma cause by her.\n\nA comedy story filled with nurturing shota and avoiding death routes!>"
