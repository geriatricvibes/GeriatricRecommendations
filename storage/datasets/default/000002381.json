	"description": "Friday, December 23rd. Two days before Christmas, the streets were full of people. It was time for Seonwoo, who had reached the crosswalk at the end of the downtown area against the crowds, to take a step while cooling off his tired head from repeated overtime. Closer, closer. The sound of a nightmare-like loud horn was heard as the noise and carol-soothing songs broke through his ears. If someone hadn't pushed him away, it would have been the last sound. Without even having time to say thank you to the woman who saved him.\r\n\r\n'What a relief. I'm so glad that you’re okay.….'\r\n\r\nThe woman shed tears, repeating her unknown words, and was swept away in the crowd. And, no one was where the pedestrians disappeared. Yoo Jina, the self-proclaimed angel, who suddenly approached as if dealing with someone she knew very well, and left no place to turn around. Twelve meetings were so short and intense until flowers blossomed in the cold, desolate fields of a man who did not believe in people. It was enough to shake the life of a thirty years old Cha Seonwoo, a single-minded accountant.>"
