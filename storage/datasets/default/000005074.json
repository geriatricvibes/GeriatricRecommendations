	"description": "Wei Suo, a low level cultivator from the Spirit Peak City was scammed in a transaction. He ended up purchasing a damaged low level magical treasure. However, this worthless damaged magical treasure had an artifact spirit that already lived for several tens of thousands of years… On top of that, compared to several tens of thousands of years ago, many of the rare and sparse things were abundant now.\n\nThe first thing Wei Suo discovered was that the materials used to make a Fire Talisman that was worth half a Low Quality Spiritual Stone were extremely abundant now.>"
