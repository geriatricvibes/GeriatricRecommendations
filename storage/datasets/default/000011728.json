	"description": "A flying dagger arrives, an inch of radiance appears; the Overlord has passed on a successor to the people of modern times! Flying dagger! A new type of cultivation path through flying daggers!\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around an uniquely skilled “Xiao Li Flying Dagger” youth. Because his meridians were ordinary, he could not achieve greatness through internal cultivation. Later however, he was able to obtain a Dan medicine; a refining pellet that is able to shed one’s mortal body and exchange one’s bones, the “Essence Cleansing Dan!”>"
