	"description": "Somehow, I found myself reincarnated as an extra from a reverse harem novel. Although a peasant girl, my family was relatively well-off thanks to my mother working as a nanny for some kind noblemen. \n\nThere’s just one problem: I’m destined to be the final boss, the queen of snakes who puts the entire empire at risk.\n\nThe autumn my mother passed away was the same year the empire fell into chaos. The noblemen my mother served imprisoned me with the children of the Duke, hiding us away in secret part of the mansion. \n\nThe details of our 700 days of imprisonment are absent from the novel, so I’ve no choice but to survive by my own wits. My little villains and I, together as one.>"
