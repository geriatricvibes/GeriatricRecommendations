	"description": "Ten years, three-thousand and six-hundred days in total. It may seem like a long time, but when you are actually living it day by day, times flies like nothing else. In these ten years, he has only told me “I like you” once. I remember that moment clearly to this day. It was a clear and sunny afternoon. The sunlight shot through the window and lit up the bed that was underneath us. Under the veil of golden light, my smile turned warm and gentle. Even till now, it is the happiest day out of these ten years for me.>"
