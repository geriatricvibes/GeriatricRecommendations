	"description": "The first time they meet, he arrests her under suspicions that she's involved in a murder case. He's so handsome that she, as the head of an entertainment company, is determined to recruit him into her company, train him to be a star, and make him her cash cow! But he is neither short of money nor fame and refuses her. So she decides—to make him her boyfriend first. \r\n\r\n'I'm 5'4' tall. Do you think I need to tiptoe to kiss you?' She smiles brightly, ogling at him. The man gives her a deadpan glance. 'Are you daydreaming?' She licks her lips and smiles. 'Yes, I'm dreaming about having sex with you.' '......!!!' \r\n\r\nA few months later, Song Yi finally loses her patience and asks, 'Do you like me or not? I've been chasing you for so long!' Tang Si smiles and whispers to her, 'Miss Song, this can only prove that you're not attractive enough.' Annoyed, Song Yi is about to retort only to hear his husky and sultry voice. 'Let me teach you—how to attract a man.' Her mind goes blank! \r\n\r\nAt first, she imagines Tang Si to be a mature and reliable man, but it turns out that he's actually lazy, naughty, and damn good at seducing women! \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\n'What would you do if you hadn't chosen to be a policeman?' \r\n\r\n'Be a star.' The man cracks a smile. \r\n\r\n'Become CEO Song's… cash cow.' \r\n\r\nEveryone is shocked. 'How dare this woman poach someone from our police force?'>"
