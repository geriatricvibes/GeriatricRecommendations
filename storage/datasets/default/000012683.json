Thinking that she lost her memory, he offered her a contract where she would pledge her blood to him whenever he needed it, and in return, he vowed to protect her and keep her alive.\n\nBut is he really a friend or a foe?\n\nMoreover, will a normal high school girl survive in this dangerous world?>"
