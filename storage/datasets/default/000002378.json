	"description": "“He hates buxom girls! He always imagined it was me in his arms when holding you.” \r\n\r\nThe day before my coronation as a queen, my fiancé abandoned me. And my beautiful sister, miserably trapped in the tower, mocked me.\r\n\r\n“Are you saying I am a replacement?”\r\n\r\nMy perfect fiancé guffawed at my words, eyes filled with disdain as he looked at me.\r\n\r\n“You are a substitute to the replacement. Even being a replacement … YOU.CANNOT.”\r\n\r\nI will go back and change everything.\r\n\r\nSpiteful sister, cruel fiancé, vile half-brother, and heartless biological father, and the vicious stepmother who exploited and plundered me! I am not going to let go of you all! I will drink all your blood to the last drop and rip off your flesh to the bones! Your nice and kind second daughter no longer exists!\r\n\r\n“Don’t cry, Ariadne. You deserve to be treated better than that,” the sweet prince, my brother-in-law, said.\r\n\r\n“Goddammit! I’m, right now, even begging you!” \r\n\r\nNow even the fiancé has changed his attitude completely! \r\n\r\nAh, let’s see how this story ends…\r\n\r\nAriadne, the illegitimate child of Cardinal… This time, she will throw herself into the political turmoil to win both love and power. >"
