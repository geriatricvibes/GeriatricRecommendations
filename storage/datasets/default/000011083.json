	"description": "One smile has the flowers vying for brilliance\r\n\r\nOne smile has the beauties all enraptured.\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\nThe fool finally couldn’t take it any longer and cried on his shoulder, “Gege, is it because I am stupid that you don’t want me anymore?”\r\n\r\nDu Mengluo only said one word: “want.”\r\n\r\n----\r\nLater on, Xue Dan is no longer an idiot. He is now the owner of Huaixugu, Bai Jing Fang. Languidly strolling about, shards of memories suddenly reappeared in his mind and he choked while hugging Du Mengluo. 'Gege, is it because I am no longer stupid that you don't want me anymore?'\r\n\r\nDu Mengluo still only said one word: 'want.'>"
