	"description": "At the movie premiere, a curious reporter notices the marks on Xia Siyu’s neck. “What’s that?” \r\n\r\nXia Siyu flicks her hair carelessly. “A mosquito bit me.” \r\n\r\nAfter returning home, Bo Yan pins her against the wall, his voice teasing yet dangerous. \r\n\r\n“A mosquito? Do I need to bite you again?” \r\n\r\nXia Siyu gains weight easily and is always fat shamed with words like being “as fat as a pregnant woman”. One day, she is mocked so harshly that she appears on the top searches. While everyone thinks of it as another joke, the movie star, Bo Yan, replies unexpectedly, “Thank you for your well wishes! Our baby is already three months old.”>"
