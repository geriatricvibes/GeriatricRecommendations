	"description": "My mother used to be called a villainess…\n\nShe was falsely accused of many charges, and thus, sentenced to be exiled.\n\nAfter sometime, she was kidnapped… That is when I was born, Ashley.\n\nShe never said a word about it, but my hair and eyes are of the same color as that ‘man’.\n\nThat is the reason I prefer to hide them behind glasses that would turn my appearance ugly.\n\nThanks to my good grades and skills, I received a scholarship and entered the royal academy, at the age of 15.\n\nThat is how I left the countryside and went to live in the royal capital.\n\nIn the midst of this, I met a divine beast and strangely, the Crown Prince has taken interest in me.>"
