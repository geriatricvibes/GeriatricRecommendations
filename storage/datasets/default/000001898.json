	"description": "There once was a very popular question on the internet:\n\nIf one morning, you woke up and realized that your gender had changed, what would be your first reaction?\n\nAnd someone on the internet had famously responded:\n\nFirst, give your bros a good time!\n\nSu Jian remembered that when he saw this reply, he had slapped the table to express his admiration. What a good bro! Such loyalty!\n\nBut now that he actually encountered this strange situation himself, he could only feel an extremely ball-breaking alarm, shocked grief, and frightened anger. F**k your mom! Ah, f**k! F**k it!\n\nOh, a correction. The above is grammatically incorrect. After all, poor Classmate Su Jian doesn’t have balls anymore.>"
