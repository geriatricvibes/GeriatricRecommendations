Who still believes in cultivation!\r\n\r\nHowever, to complete his mission, he set up a cultivation training class as an attempt to get people to cultivate, and in the process of doing so, got sent to the mental hospital multiple times.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to give up after all the setbacks, until he encountered a group of elderlymen and women.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nA 93-year-old man of the Weapon Forging specialization was forging gear at home when he was coincidentally discovered by his great-granddaughter who was livestreaming.\r\n\r\nDuring his birthday banquet, a 100-year-old man of the Combat specialization flew on a sword while in high spirits.\r\n\r\nAn 80-year-old lady of the Alchemy specialization was mistaken as her college-attending granddaughter’s sister while she was visiting her.>"
