	"description": "When I met him, I realized that I was a ‘mob character’. \n\nMy childhood friend, my best friend, my stepsister, and everyone else I fell in love with, fell in love with him. \n\nBut there was one girl who showed a completely separate face only in front of me. \n\nI’m not sure what to make of it. \n\nNormally she doesn’t talk much, but she’s all talk when she’s in front of me.\n\n She smiles only at me. \n\nEven though she was the main heroine, she fell in love with me, a mob character–this is my story. \n\nThis is a romantic comedy about a dull mob character.>"
