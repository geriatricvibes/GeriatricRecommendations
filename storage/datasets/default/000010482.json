	"description": "Nara Lee, an ambitious and diligent 35 year old, has finally achieved her dream: buying a rooftop apartment! Little did she know she wouldn’t have time to enjoy it, as she ends up reincarnated as the 8-year-old Sharon Atrina, a side character in her favorite webnovel, “The Queen’s Extravagant Outing.” As Sharon, a wealthy and beautiful noblewoman, she has everything she could possibly want, but she’s destined to die a pitiful death at the age of 20 after being betrayed by her best friend, Carol — the villainess!\n\nRather than waiting for death, she takes it upon herself to raise Carol — whose terrible personality resulted from bad parenting — into a better person, and save both of their lives to change their future!>"
