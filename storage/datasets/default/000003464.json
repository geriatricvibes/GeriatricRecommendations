	"description": "When Wen Ning was 20 years old, she was taken back to Hancheng’s Jiang house to fulfill her engagement. After marriage although, Jiang Shu was humble and courteous for half a year. In the end, she failed to warm his heart.\n\nLeaving that night, the rain and cold wind made the little girl curl up on the cold chair with her legs in her arms, and her thin face was pale with cold.\n\nIn the car not far away, the assistant said nervously, “Mr. Jiang, shall I go and get Miss Wen back?” The man hung his lips coldly, closed his eyes and pretended to sleep: “Let her be might as well she learn a lesson. If she can’t stand it, she will go home.” Jiang Shu miscalculated for the first time in his life. After that night, he never even heard her voice again.\n\nFew weeks later.\n\nJiang Shu received a call about his sister asking for family members to bail after she caused trouble in a bar. The man didn’t care: “Don’t let it out, just lock it up.”\n\nJiang Mengmeng heared the call: “Brother! My little sister-in-law is here too! She is locked up with me! Help us!” Jiang Shu sat up and said, “Ask her to say something to me.”\n\nWen Ning abruptly said, “No comment.”\n\nThe man suddenly lost his voice and replied: “Wait for me, I will come right away.”>"
