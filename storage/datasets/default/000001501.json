	"description": "I was excommunicated from my family for a crime I did not commit. But it wasn’t bad. I didn’t have much affection for the family, and I wanted to get out of the original flow of the novel.\n\nSo I received a portion of my property that was originally mine, and left the family without hesitation.\n\nI was happy to think that I was finally freed from the original work.\n\nI came down to a quiet countryside and bought a mansion far from the village.\n\nIt was a size that was enough to live alone.\n\nNow, I thought I could live peacefully, gardening for the rest of my life here.\n\nBut life, as always, did not go my way.\n\nKnights came to the peaceful village. Among them was Izar, my former fiance who ignored me. The words that came out from his mouth were quite shocking.\n\n“Hestine was not the saint who will defeat the devil.”\n\nNo. Hestine is the one who will save the world from the devil. I know best because I’ve read the novel.\n\n“Adelia, that’s you.”>"
