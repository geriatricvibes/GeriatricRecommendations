	"description": "Suddenly died while working part-time in the present world. When I woke up I was standing there with a spear.\r\n\r\nWhat? Isn't this the world of the f**king game I was playing yesterday?\r\n\r\nI've apparently been reincarnated as a royal castle guard named Gustav. Moreover, I'm a guard who is destined to die in the event that the princess is kidnapped by the Demon Lord's army the very next day.\r\n\r\nI can't die just after being reborn! That's why I decided to stay up all night to level up. I thought it would be enough if I could get strong enough not to die, but I feel like I'm getting too close to beautiful girls who are supposed to be members of the hero's harem, you know?>"
