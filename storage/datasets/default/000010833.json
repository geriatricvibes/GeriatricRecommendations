	"description": "He's the dream guy of women world wide, the CEO of a formidable mega-corporation. But, he's absolutely powerless against her, resorting to all kinds of methods to force her into a marriage, tying her to his side with a certficiate. \r\n\r\n'Remember, from now on, you're not allowed to enter unclean entertainment venues, not allowed to accept drinks from other men, not allowed to have physical contact with men other than me. If not, bear the consenquences.' \r\n\r\nLing Tianya felt that she was just like a girl undergoing puberty, under strict supervision of her parents, shackling her down with restrictions upon restrictions. \r\n\r\n'Your requests are ridiculous, I have meetings and obligations, I... ...' \r\n\r\nThe man held tightly onto her, as though wanting nothing more than to absorb her into himself. 'Ling Tianya, this is not a discussion.' Therefore, the CEO had became a complete slave to his wife. \r\n\r\n'My love for you is your perogative. Use me to your heart's wishes, I am more than willing!' \r\n\r\nBut all he got in exchange was an eye roll, 'Keep it for yourself, I don't need it!'>"
