	"description": "I knew I had reincarnated as a child from a poor and ruined home.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I thought about the pastry shop, which in my previous life, I could not afford.\r\n\r\nBut in this life everything is different.\r\n\r\nOriginally, I was a possessed young woman who got in the way of the protagonist's love story and ultimately wanted power.\r\n\r\nIf I want to avoid the bad ending, I must show the biggest lack of interest in power. Then, I will be able to bake the sweets that I have always wanted so much.\r\n\r\nBut with the emperor, not everything is so simple ...\r\n\r\n'How long will you avoid me for?'\r\n\r\nHwang Tae Son, the male lead, will drive me to ruin ...\r\n\r\n'You are my only cousin.'\r\n\r\nDuke, the strongest knight of the empire ...\r\n\r\n'I love your lime pie.'\r\n\r\nEven a slave who is meant to plunge a knife into me ...\r\n\r\n'I want to save you from death.'\r\n\r\nDo you want me to be by your side?>"
