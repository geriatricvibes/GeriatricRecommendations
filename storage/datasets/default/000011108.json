	"description": "He Yun Zui said, “Little white rabbit, since you’ve entered my heart, you’re not allowed to leave.”\n\nChi Ran replied, “Big tiger, I hope my heart can belong to you alone.”\n\nChi Ran is a simple white rabbit, small and white, who makes He Yun Zui’s head hurt. As soon as Chi Ran was taken over by He Yun Zui, he knew that his acting career was no longer ordinary. After He Yun Zui brought Chi Ran to his side, he knew that this person would definitely belong to him. \n\nBut when the little white rabbit with emotional disorder was approached purposefully by the domineering tiger, he couldn’t understand his heart.\n\nThe tiger confessed. As long as the little white rabbit could stay by his side, then that was enough. He Yun Zui finally plucked up the courage to confess his love: “I like you.”\n\nChi Ran blinked his eyes, puzzled: “I don’t know what like is, can you… teach me?”>"
