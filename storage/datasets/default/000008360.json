	"description": "Han Yibi, frsutrated with his life and job, stumbles into a run down comic store only to find his father’s martial arts novel there. As he reaches the last page of the novel: \n\n“Will you… continue?”\n\nWhen I woke up, I thought I was a noble but… I became dirt poor again. I got the unlucky short end of the stick. The ruined Murim world too, also is a fool for pointing fingers at everyone for being insufficient.\n\nI have to take down the faceless demon to get home?\n\nSave the original story to yourself!\n\nLet’s just grow stronger and help the main character.\n\nThat’s how I’ll get out of this world!>"
