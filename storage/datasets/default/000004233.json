	"description": "With the marriage of her prostitute mother to the Count, Aria's status in society skyrocketed immediately. After leading a life of luxury, Aria unfairly meets death because of her sister Mielle's schemes. And right before she dies, she sees an hourglass fall as if it were a fantasy. And just like that, she was miraculously brought back to the past.\r\n\r\n'I want to become a very elegant person, just like my sister, Mielle.'\r\n\r\nIn order to face the villainess, she must become an even more wicked villainess. This was the new path Aria chose to take revenge on Mielle who murdered both her and her mother.>"
