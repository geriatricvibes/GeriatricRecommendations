	"description": "I-, who was suppose to die in an accident, awakened as my vampire princess character from “Eternal Horizon Online”. It turned out that I together with my entire pet, assets, and territory from within the game had been transferred into a different world similar to that game.\n\nI was in a higher post than my followers who are stronger than me, I have no choice but to act like the ‘me’ in the game. Furthermore the demons and beasts of this world and even demi-human start following me, before I noticed I had established a huge empire. Also, the trouble caused by mysterious enemies is just endless…!>"
