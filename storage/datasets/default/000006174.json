	"description": "Xia Wan has transmigrated into a book, and he has somehow become a cannon fodder who was ambushed by the protagonist in the novel.\r\n\r\nWhen he transmigrated, he was in Slag Gong’s engagement banquet and was humiliated.\r\n\r\nXia Wan casually grabbed the tallest, handsome man in the audience and quietly asked for help.\r\n\r\nIn the silence, it was easy to see the almost top-quality man’s star-shaped eyes and a smile on his lips. He quietly hooked his arms around Xia Wan.\r\n\r\nLater, Xia Wan discovered that the handsome man whom he held tightly was protagonist Gong’s brother, Huo Yu, the biggest villain in the book.>"
