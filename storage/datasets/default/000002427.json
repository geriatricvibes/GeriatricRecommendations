	"description": "As a useless, spoiled and wild child, Bai YiHan finally brought about the end of his family, chased away the one he loved and caused his own death. After rebirth, he decides to cleanse himself and work hard at being a good child. But a lot of things don’t seem to be as he expected…\n\nBai Pa + Bai Ma: My son’s so obedient. Someone must be bullying him. This cannot be forgiven!\n\nBai Big Bro + Bai Big Sis: If my little brother’s sensibility comes from his suffering, then I’d rather he be a spoiled brat forever!\n\nMu JingYuan: If HanHan hits you, you must accept it. Yet you dodged…The wind’s changing. Someone should be bankrupt to make HanHan smile.\n\nBai YiHan: … I was so wild in my past life, your involvements are undeniable!>"
