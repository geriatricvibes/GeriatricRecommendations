	"description": "All of a sudden, the man covered his eyes with his hand and mutedly laugh towards the sky. His smile was inconsolable and despairing. The falling rain had assaulted his throat while laughing before he finally lowered his head and broke into a bout of violent coughs. His eyes welled up with tears, but he continued to laugh.\r\n\r\nThat laughter was more woeful than crying itself…\r\n\r\nThey were never his, to begin with. That gentle smile. That caring look in the eyes. That comfort of embrace…\r\n\r\nThey were never his! Never, ever had been!!\r\n\r\nHe was just a clown! Laughable and expendable!\r\n\r\nThe main character had already made his appearance. His current self wasn’t even worthy of being a substitute. Not to mention, he was dirty and broken. His face was now disfigured.\r\n\r\nSo.… He had arrived at this world, lost his status, and lost his loved ones only to become a vessel―a vessel that temporarily carried the breath of life for another. And he thought that he could undertake that someone else’s relationship.>"
