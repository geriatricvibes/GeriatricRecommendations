	"description": "Infernal Demon Dragon: A dog like you dare to face me in combat? Do you wish to die so much? \r\n\r\nJiang Feng: Donâ€™t get too cocky, lizard! You will soon become energy used for my evolution! Transmute Monster, transmute! \r\n\r\nSo, what can you do when you entered the game and accidentally became a Level 1 wild dog? \r\n\r\nNo worries. With Transmute Monster, I can endlessly evolve. At the same time, I can transmute any monsters into materials and items that I want! \r\n\r\nJiang Feng: Who said that players are the only one that can kill monsters? Who said players are the only ones that can flirt? Who said players are the only ones that can build cities? \r\n\r\nMy existence will subvert all the expectations and become an existence that surpasses the Divine Beasts! \r\n\r\n>"
