Your Aunt Xiu has given birth to a baby!”\n\nLin Cheng opened his eyes wide, given birth to a baby?\n\nListening to the adult talking, Cheng, who was laying on his stomach on top of his father’s leg, crawled forward with all his might. Younger sister, younger sister, I want to see younger sister!\n\nLin father held and carried him up, and so Lin Cheng had his wish to see the younger sister fulfilled.\n\n“Waaaaa~”Lin Cheng wailed.\n\n“What happened, Cheng?”\n\nLin Cheng pointed at the small round dumpling, “You shaved the cat’s hair!”\n\n“……”\n\nAfter a month.\n\nCheng blinked, staring at the saliva flowing from the tender and fair dumpling. This is, this is……. The hairless cat?\n\nLightly poked it with his finger, Cheng breathed and smiled foolishly.\n\nThe cat was out of favor! Cheng liked this hairless cat more!\n\nA collection of snippets depicting the sweet evolution of two childhood sweethearts.>"
