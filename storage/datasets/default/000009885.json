	"description": "The Galactic Prince is a maiden game released in 2038.\n\nThe heroine falls in love with various characters in the universe 1,700 years in the future.\n\nA boy in the far future who had such a dream gradually believes it is connected to reality.\n\nIf this was the standard version with the flower garden development, he would have laughed it off.\n\nHowever, the progress seems to follow the ported hard mode version, with an interstellar war about to break out.\n\nAware of the imminent destruction of the capital planet, he joined the military academy in order to get onboard the space fortress.>"
