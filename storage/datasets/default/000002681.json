Never did she expect to marry him and surprised many!\n\n'Sir, Young Madam took a fancy to an expensive jade.'\nHe looked up and replied with a casual air, 'No matter the price, buy it for her!'\n\n'Sir, Young Madam is fighting with others!'\nHis face darkened and he immediately ordered, 'Get her a few more men. Make sure she doesn’t lose. How dare they bully my wife?'\n\n'Sir, Young Madam has been reported having an affair with a man!' \nUpon hearing this, he could bear no more and dashed out without a second thought.>"
