	"description": "In her last life, she was framed and sent into prison.\r\n\r\nAfter being born again, she felt just like a vengeful general, ruining all the tricks and pitfalls, dumping that scum male, braving a vicious stepmother, just to protect everything that she wants to guard.\r\n\r\nIn her last life, she treated the only man who was like a god, who loved her, like nothing, and regretted it.\r\n\r\nAfter the rebirth, she tries her best to get close to him, asking for hugs, hugging his thigh, acting spoiled.\r\n\r\nLi Jingzhao always guarded against her: “Tang Nuanhua, what kind of tricks are you playing?”\r\n\r\nShe warmly smiled: “I am not playing any tricks, I was very serious just now… I want to chase you!”>"
