	"description": "The moment she believed she won, everything went back to the beginning.\n\nKalmia Phlox, whose dead brother came to life, was engaged to a man she was close to, and had a relationship with the man she was in love with. In her very different relationships, she comes closer to a truth she did not know in her previous life…\n\n“It’s greed to wish for something you don’t have the ability to handle!”\n\n“Yes, I know. I’m being greedy. Do I need permission to be greedy?”\n\nShe’ll be the Count again in this life.\n\nIt’s not a lucky title, but it was won with her own strength, so she’ll be a perfect Count who was nobody’s scarecrow.>"
