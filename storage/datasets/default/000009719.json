	"description": "The Oriole Island belonged to the famous and notable Murong family. The current island owner was a young girl Murong Qiang. Because of her father’s death, she was surrounded by lots of ambitious people in the capital. Then she went back to the Oriole Island with her widowed mother and young sister. Murong Qiang’s sister, Murong Wei, a gorgeous beauty was engaged with the nobleman Ren Shiqiong, but she eloped with the famous painter Xu Zihui. So Murong Qiang married Ren Shiqiong instead of her sister.\n\nThe mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. But sometimes, it is hard to find out who is the oriole and who is the cicada.\n\nSeven people said the same story, but the whole story was not clear until the end, and the story was always reversed back and forth.\n\nMaybe in the end you were going to ask me, was this the original story?\n\nI don’t know either.>"
