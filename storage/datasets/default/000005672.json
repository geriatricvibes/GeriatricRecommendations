She gets a new job, new friends and… a new boss whom she mistakes as a male host!\r\n\r\nHe helps her to get revenge on a back-stabbing friend, supports her when it seems that the world has given up on her, encourages her to be more confident about herself and even… messes up her blind dates! \r\n\r\nWith her strong working abilities and fiery attitude, she manages to climb up the ranks in the company (under the devious scheme of a certain CEO) and even gains a fan girl who can’t wait to be her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nAs Pei Ge navigates through the ups and downs of office politics, family drama, finding her right partner and societal expectations, she realizes that things are not as simple as it seemed and everything she had believed in is tested…\r\n\r\nThe Big Misunderstanding:\r\n\r\n“You asshole! Why didn’t you use protection?! I’m pregnant!”\r\n“…It’s not mine.”\r\n“Asshole! You actually dare to not admit it?! I gave all my firsts to you! You jerk!”\r\n…\r\nAt the gynecologist, she read her pregnancy lab report and was stunned: Irregular period.\r\nThe man raised an eyebrow and smirked, “Didn’t you make a ruckus about being pregnant with my child? Where is the child?!”\r\n“…” Who is scared of who? Let’s make a bet!>"
