	"description": "There are six billion people on Earth and yet, we know each other. This is such a huge coincidence, so why don’t we be together?\r\nYou care about me just like how I care about you, so why don’t we be together?\r\nI like you; coincidentally, you like me too. Since fate has brought us together, why don’t we be together?\r\nThe porridge today is so delicious, such a rare thing, why don’t we be together?\r\nThe weather today is pretty good, why don’t we be together?\r\nThat little dog is so cute, why don’t we be together?\r\n\r\nLu Nanxuan, for so many years now we have been just like two kids, running after and hiding from each other. I’ve grown old and am also tired. I can’t run after you anymore. Let us, properly and truly, be together…\r\n\r\nAnd so, there were joyful tidings at Nan Home.>"
