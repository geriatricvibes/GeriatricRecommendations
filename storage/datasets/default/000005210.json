	"description": "The night he crossed over, he was told that his “wife” was having a baby.\n\nUpon entering the delivery room, he discovered his “wife” is actually a man!!!\n\nWas there anything more terrifying than this?!\n\nLi Jin had just woken up when he saw a man run out from the room.\n\n“Li Jin, your family’s husband is having difficulty giving birth. He can’t hold on anymore!”\n\nIn ancient times, dystocia was known as “one corpse, two lives”.\n\nWithout even thinking about it, Li Jin rushed into the delivery room. —He was an obstetrician.\n\n…\n\nAfter crossing over, Dr. Li, who was respected for his medical skills, became a “soft rice man” who relied on his “wife”. What surprised Li Jin the most was that although his ‘wife’ could have children, he was a man and was in dystocia. Li Jin rushed into the delivery room without thinking. In ancient times, dystocia meant “one corpse, two lives”, it was important to give treatment!>"
