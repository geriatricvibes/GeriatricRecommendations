	"description": "She was born into an affluent family, but she was swapped at birth and got a different life. \r\n\r\nShe grew up in a village. Just as she got the opportunity to transform her life, it got taken from her, and she was forced into a marriage to trade for a marriage for her mentally-challenged big brother. \r\n\r\nIn the end, she died tragically. \r\n\r\nGu Yan thought that if she could be reborn, she would make those who had bullied and insulted her regret everything! \r\n\r\nAfter being reborn with a superpower, her life became quite different. \r\n\r\n“With both the medical skill and the superpower, wastrels, shiver for me!” \r\n\r\n“Also you, handsome boy, I saved your life; shouldn’t you pledge to marry me?” \r\n\r\nLu Ye smiled naughtily. “Of course. Just tell me, Yanyan, how many times do you want me to pledge per night?”>"
