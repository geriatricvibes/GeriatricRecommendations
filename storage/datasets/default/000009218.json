	"description": "It all started from a death match.\n\nChu Feiyang’s first trip to Cang Lang mountain was the time first he saw Jun Shuying. The name was just a simple name to him, it was just a target he was going to kill on this trip and was just an insignificant brush stroke on his list of people that harmed Jianghu and needed to be removed. After their first battle, Jun Shuying escaped and regained a bit of his strength, but then another enemy came knocking. His life was saved, but Jun Shuying was being fed an unknown pill (that make him able to get pregnant) by his friend, and then his body became painful and cold.\n>"
