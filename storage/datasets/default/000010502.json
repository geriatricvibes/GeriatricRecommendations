	"description": "No more pushovers!\n\nThe main character in Maristella’s life was her friend Dorothea. Maristella was no more than a supporting role, and she struggled and sacrificed herself for her friend’s happiness, only to be betrayed in return.\n\nDorothea threw Maristella to her death for her own benefit.\n\n“We’re friends, Marie.”\n\nIt was Maristella who died miserably.\n\n“So make a concession, will you?”\n\nAs I watched Dorothea sacrifice her “friend”, I vowed never to have a miserable ending like that novel.\n\n“You don’t seem like the person I know. It’s like you’re a different person.”\n\n“I decided I would not be subservient to Dorothea anymore.”\n\nI wouldn’t be as kind-hearted as Maristella. So this time I won’t suffer, Dorothea.>"
