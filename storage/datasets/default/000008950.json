	"description": "Fu Yao’s father, Fu Chengyan, who has been vegetative for more than ten years suddenly woke up one day.\nThe doctor who witnessed all this sighed: People wake up, but they turn crazy!\n\nFu Chengyan, who had been in the cultivation world for two thousand years, went back to his own world. When he saw his daughter again, he found her with short hair, possessing very old clothes, and having a pitiful look due malnutrition.\n\nFeeling guilty, Fu Chengyan wanted to know his daughter’s true thoughts in order to compensate her. He then read her inner world with mind reading.\n\n“It’s was not easy to raise myself already, and now I have to raise a dad with a brain problem… My life is too difficult.”\n\n“It seems that the scholarship I am receiving is not enough.”\n\n“It’s better to sell the first place in the school to that person.”\n\n“Isn’t the second-placer a silly girl? Let’s sell the second-place to the third-placed silly girl also…”\n\n“How much was the prize for the oral English contest?”\n\n“Although Dad has a problem with his brain, he still looks so handsome. Is the rich woman next door still thinking about him? How…”\n\nFu Chengyan: Thank you for being a filial daughter!>"
