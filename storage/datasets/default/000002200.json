	"description": "This book consists of a string of short stories, combining the quirky writings of the talented Kevin Tsai, with illustrations from Cola King, to bring you the stories of more than 30 boys that have made a lasting impression on Tsai. There is no flowery rhetoric here, only simple retellings, like a friend from your class telling you of some past memories from their youth, and thus makes up this interesting literary work.\n\nThe new Holy Angels Edition brings you an additional 18 new stories penned by well-known intellectual and TV host Kevin Tsai, as well as entirely new illustrations from the creative mind of Cola King.>"
