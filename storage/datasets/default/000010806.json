	"description": "A pill, a tiny capsule encased in a biologically harmless water-soluble shell; A shell whose very existence is a result of a century of research and technological advancement. A manmade synthesis of Chemicals and product of complex processes.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, a means to an end.\r\n\r\nA way to deliver a concoction of other Chemicals for an agenda; Vitamins for nutrition, medication for treatment, or… perhaps more.\r\n\r\nWe trust that what we eat won’t do us harm, and trust that those who are responsible for its creation had the best of intentions. But in the end, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to truly tell what lies within a pill.\r\n\r\nThat is until one day I entered a research institution as a test subject. All I did was swallow a pill I was told to be a health supplement.>"
