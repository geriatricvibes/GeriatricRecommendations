	"description": "I lost my husband in an accident two years ago and became a single mother, and one day I was summoned to another world with my son.\n\nThe humans who summoned us called my son a hero and were trying to fight the resurrected Demon King.\n\nIt’s ridiculous to have my son in the first grade of junior high school fight against monsters! After struggling, I was treated as an obstacle and left alone in the monster’s den.\n\nIt was the demons who were supposed to be human enemies who helped me, who was waiting for death\n\nAs I spent time together, my emotions grew, but peaceful days do not last long.\n\nThe only weapon I can use to counter many challenges is to use my cooking skills and dexterity.\n\nI won’t die until I meet my son!>"
