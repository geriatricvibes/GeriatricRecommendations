	"description": "Manauta Mikagi is a person from another world who lived in Japan from childhood to college.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of his third year at university, he was involved in an accident and was transported to another world.\r\n\r\nHaving defeated a dragon right at the start in the sword and magic world that I dreamed of, what should I do after this?\r\n\r\n“I can’t. I can’t do this. The food is disgusting, the toilets stink, there are no bathrooms… Argh, I can’t!”\r\n\r\nManauta, who grew up in Japan, can’t stand living in a foreign world that resembles the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only thing he can do is slay dragons.\r\n\r\nSo Manauta decides.\r\n\r\nHe is determined to make his name recognized, gather his men, and regain the same level of life as in Japan.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in other worlds, everyone has magical powers called skills.\r\n\r\n“It should be possible… if I can gather enough people… maybe.”\r\n\r\nThus begins Manauta struggle.>"
