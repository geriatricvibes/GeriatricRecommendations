	"description": "Golden Crow Chi Yao, born with a charming bone, entered the three thousand worlds after death to cultivate her soul.\n\n1 (Vengeance): Being drugged and thrown into the street, she is an idol that everyone spurned on as a pregnant woman. When Chi Yao came, everything hadn’t happened yet, so she stepped on the tool man to take the lead, and ended all the hatred.\n\n2 (Redemption): She became a five-star NPC who was attacked and abandoned in the love game. Goal: Counter the strategy player and become the king of strategy.\n\n3 (Light): She became an interstellar summoned beast, and was considered a deformed three-legged crow as soon as she appeared. Chi Yao feathered as the Golden Crow, captured all the light, and became the interstellar sun.\n\n4 (Honor): Oran, the dragon god, is a source of strength and a puppet. She came to the world of power and dismantled all the disguises in exchange for royal power.>"
