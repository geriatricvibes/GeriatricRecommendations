	"description": "\n500 years ago, Chen Xi was devoured by a crack in the void and was transported into a cultivation world.\n\n500 years later, he returned back to Earth after enduring through several hardships and discovered that only 5 years had gone by.\n\n...\n\n\nIn the courtyard, beauty at the side, a candle flame wavering.\n\nA gush of clear wind, half a full moon, the peach tree remains unchanging.\n\n…\n\nWait, whose kid is this?! Why is she calling me papa? Gazing at the little girl in front of him with skin as pale as jade, Chen Xi froze.\n\n…\n\n　\nReturning home from cultivation, starting as a stay-at-home dad.\n\nIn this life, not fighting to be a king nor claiming to be a tyrant, only praying to peacefully be a wife-pampering mad devil and a child-protecting daddy!\n>"
