	"description": "She came back from the unknown gate wearing only a black dress with a black parasol. A first-generation hunter, Cha Eunha, went missing 30 years ago.\n\nIn the early 2000s, they had been locked within a mysterious gate.\n\nFor someone to escape, one must stay behind…\n\n“It’s because you have more reasons to stay alive for than me.” \n\nEunha sacrificed herself for her colleague Yijun, killed monsters to survive and met a man who found her when there were no monsters left to kill.\n\n“You’re the boss.”\n\nShin Siwoo, the first S-Class hunter that she’s ever heard of.\n\nWhen Eunha had managed to get out of the strange gate,\n\n“Thirty years…have passed?”\n\nThe world had changed so much.\n\nBesides, Baek Yijun, an old colleague that she had met after a long time,\n\n“You know what. I hate the fact that people like you are hunters.”\n\n—was not the person Eunha had remembered.>"
