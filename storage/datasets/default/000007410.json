	"description": "I was the hidden leader of a rebellion.\n\nI took in and enslaved the blue knight, who because of me, would be executed. \n\nAs previously promised, I was about to give him the title of a duke.\n\n“Don’t call me Knight, I’m not a knight. Please don’t even use honorifics with me. I’m not a noble.”\n\n“I am simply Your Highness’ slave.” \n\nThough he is a broken knight, with him, I must try and rebel once again.>"
