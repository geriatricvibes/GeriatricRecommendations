	"description": "One day after school, Souta Amane was called to the roof. Waiting there was Mei Hirose, a beautiful gyaru of their class. She confesses her feelings to Amane but he sees it as a punishment game since they have hardly had any contact until now.\r\n\r\nHowever, next Monday, when Amane arrives at school, Hirose, who has had very little to do with Amane’s life until now, starts to get closer to him in an unimaginably aggressive way.\r\n\r\n「Areh? Has the punishment game not ended after I’ve seen through it?」>"
