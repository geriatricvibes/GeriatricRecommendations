	"description": "After rebirth, Shen Yuanye discovered that her Weibo page was able to foresee the future.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she followed the other party’s Weibo page, it would immediately refresh to show the other party’s [Portrait of the Deceased], [Date of Death], and [Picture of the Death Scene].\r\n\r\n……Eventually, the foreseeing function of her Weibo page had upgraded.\r\n\r\n“Film Emperor Zhang and Empress of Pop Li, who fights everyday……are actually in the same Portrait of the Deceased?”\r\n\r\n“Singer was killed……the murderer’s shoe was photographed at the death scene?”\r\n\r\n“The new young actress and the Film Empress……died at the same time?”\r\n\r\nJiang Pan: Why do you not follow me on Weibo?\r\n\r\nShen Yuanye: ……\r\n\r\nThat was because she did not want to see both of them together in his Portrait of the Deceased after she followed him on Weibo. I shall unfollow you, unfollow!>"
