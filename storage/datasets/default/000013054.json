	"description": "After the system set out the conditions for obtaining eternal life, whether it be money or beauty, magic or martial arts, whatever he wanted; Su Yuyang accepted the status of task executor. \r\n\r\nHowever, he found out that if he wanted to be the father of villain bosses; he didn't only need to earn money to support his family, but also to be handsome and charming, otherwise the villain would reject him! \r\n\r\nWuwuwu, system, you tricked me! Can I retract my decision to bind with the system? \r\n\r\nSystem: you jumped into the pit yourself. Retraction rejected. At most, you can borrow some points to save yourself at the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nThree worlds later... \r\n\r\nDebt-laden system: Host, can I take back the fact that you can borrow points?  \r\n\r\nSu Yuyang: Can't. You said it yourself. You don't accept retractions. At best, I'll borrow less next time. \r\n>"
