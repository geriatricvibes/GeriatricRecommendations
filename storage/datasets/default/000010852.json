Men, on the other hand, go downhill after their thirties. \n\nThat is why, a young man paired with an older woman is the perfect combination. \n\nGuo Zhi, woman, 28 years old, has a car and a house. \n\nAlex, man, 20 years old, has no fixed place to live. \n\nWhat Alex worries about is how he can rely on Guo Zhi for all his life. >"
