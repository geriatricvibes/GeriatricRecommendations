	"description": "The protagonist, Akame Shimizu, was summoned to a parallel world with the rest of her class. Only she was hated by the goddess for some reason; her attribute values were commonplace when seen in her status, and her two skills, ‘Incompetence’ and ‘Free Dream’, resulted in no magic manifesting. With the excuse of the goddess hating her, she followed the path of tragedy, and encountered an evil god. Whether she rots there, or pursues a road of happiness from there, she would test her fate.>"
