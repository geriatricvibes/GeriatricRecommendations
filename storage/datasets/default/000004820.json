	"description": "The red meteor shower rained across the sky, a black fog engulfed the world.\n\nAfter waking from a night of torture and agony,\n\nHumans discovered they no longer dominated the world.\n\n—The hunters have become the hunted.\n\nAfter the apocalypse, I struggled for survival for ten bitter years, but ultimately couldn’t escape death.\n\nBut when I opened my eyes again, I had transformed from an ordinary 35-year old woman into a beautiful young man of 18.\n\nA different gender, a world that is both familiar yet not, an apocalypse that has vanished without a trace, and an unexpected return of 17 years of youth.\n\nLooking around, I discovered I had a powerful, protective big brother and a gentle, charming little sister.\n\nJust as things couldn’t possibly look any brighter—\n\nThe end of the world came crashing down again.\n\nAnd this time around, is it fight? Or flight?>"
