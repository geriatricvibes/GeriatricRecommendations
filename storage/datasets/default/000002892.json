	"description": "Laila Estevan is the illegitimate child of a duke. Due to her illegitimate status, she had never felt that unconditional love and affection from her family. Even on her deathbed, she was ignored. She was unwanted and unloved—that’s how it had always been. The emotional baggage she carried traveled with her when she went back to the past just a month before her death. It was then that she made a firm decision: if she couldn’t receive love from her family, she would find it elsewhere!\n\nWill Laila ever find love from others or could she find love from within?>"
