	"description": "Larry died in real life and reincarnated as a fox who was cultivating for immortality. He could only reincarnate again as a human being if he could find the real murderer who killed him. “But…ah! Why should I be reborn as a fox fairy!!!”\n\n“You…don’t come close to me! Leave me alone!” Larry the fox was shivering when he saw a man in white uniform came close to him.\n\nThe vet called Frost grabbed Larry up and… “Ackawooooooo!!!!!” It seemed as if Larry’s bark could be heard all over the whole street.\n\nFrost was somewhat confused. “What does the fox say?”\n\nLarry was actually saying:\n\n“Damn you! Let me go! By no means should I be neutered!!!”\n\n“I don’t want to be a little fox! I want to be the Kurama with nine tails!”>"
