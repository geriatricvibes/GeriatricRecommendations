	"description": "Shinichi Sagara, a black corporate warrior.\r\n\r\nAfter overcoming a nightmare of consecutive workdays, he finally got on a bus to return home, but unexpectedly, he got transferred to a different world.\r\n\r\nA young goddess on her knees, 'I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! I am really sorry!!'\r\n\r\nThe story unfolded with a climax.\r\n\r\nI escaped from the country that treats the otherworlders like company slaves and set out for freedom.\r\n\r\nI changed my name from Shinichi to Shin and moved to another country to live a slow life.\r\n\r\nBut I had to take care of the stupid prince, hunt and gather, rant at the stupid prince, raise my adventurer rank, listen to the goddess complain, discipline the stupid prince, rant at the stupid prince again, then contribute to society…. \r\n\r\nSo, this is the beginning of my slow life in another world.\r\n>"
