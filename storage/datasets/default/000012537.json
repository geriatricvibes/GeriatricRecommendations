	"description": "My wicked mother brought a girl one day.\n\nShe was the Duke’s hidden daughter, Loretta, the heroine of [Duke’s Four Children].\n\nI am Melody, the villainess who was punished with my mother for harassing her.\n\nI don’t want to die like that, so I have to treat her well now.\n\nI fed Loretta, put her to sleep, and played with her.\n\nAnd then her response was…?\n\n“I hope Melody marries Loretta!”\n\nThe endless barrage of affection led me to join her back to the duke and she said, “I’ll stick close to Ms. Melody.”\n\nHave you met someone who is a ‘Fool for Melody’ more than her?\n\nWhy am I being loved when I’ve only been kind enough to make myself live peacefully….!>"
