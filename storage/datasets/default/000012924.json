	"description": "I now possess the body of Ophelia, the villainess in the story ‘The Crown Prince Returns’.\n\nAnd just like the protagonists in the other reincarnated novels, I thought I would fare well.\n\nI died by getting guillotined the first time, the second time was getting my limbs torn apart, third was suicide by poison, and by the fourth time, I was struck with arrows atop the throne.\n\nAnd by the fifth restart, even if I tried to stray from the original storyline, I would still be doomed to die.\n\n“Concoct a poison for me. Not one that’s painful, but one that’ll kill me slowly.”\n\nTherefore, this time, with all my heart and soul, I wished to die properly for once.\n\n“After I ascend the throne, are you leaving me behind?”\n\n“I sincerely hope that her highness survives, no matter what.”\n\n“Your Highness, I wish to get to know you better.”\n\nAll these people surrounding aren’t letting me die off easily!>"
