	"description": "Aria, the younger princess of a small country, is supposed to marry a single werewolf prince from another country in place of her sister who refused to marry into the wolf family rumored to be barbarians. She was expecting a bushy coat of fur because she heard that it was a race like that of a beast, but the husband who appeared in front of her was a tall handsome guy rather than a furry creature!>"
