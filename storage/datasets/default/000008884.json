	"description": "King Ji Yue of Qin is the tyrant that all seven kingdoms are frightened of, yet there is one person, delicate and weak, with a pretty visage, that dares to be domineering in front of him. The young king looked down at beautiful youth and the cold dagger that was on his neck. \r\n\r\nIn a cold voice he asked, 'Wei Lian, you wish to revolt?'\r\n\r\nWei Lian smiled, and licked his lips: 'If you are good to me, then I will serve the king. If you are not good to me, then I will kill the king.'>"
