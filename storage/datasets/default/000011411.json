	"description": "The little handsome son-in-law passed through a world as waste material and the husband of a wealthy family. But because of his lacking aptitude, the wealthy family had driven him out. So he worked hard and found a more powerful family’s thighs to hold onto. Soon enough, he became the strongest son-in-law and husband in history.\n\nIn this world, it was impossible to practice martial arts. It was futile so he might as well take advantage of his wife’s thighs and maintain a comfortable and leisure lifestyle.\n\nHe’ll train his wife to become the strongest and best person in the world.\n\n“Whoever dares to provoke me, my wife will kill you!”>"
