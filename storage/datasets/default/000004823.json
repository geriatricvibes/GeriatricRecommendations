	"description": "“Dark Knight Zekudo False. I hereby appoint you as the captain of the Dragon Killer Squad, an elite dragon-hunting unit.”\n\nIt happened in the Spring when I’m 15 years old.\n\nI had wanted to become an S-class knight for so long, but suddenly I was given such an order by the king.\n\nI became an S-class knight because I heard that they were popular, but being a captain is such a troublesome position.\n\n“You know I have a lot of beautiful women under my command, right?”\n\n“I’ll do it!”\n\nThus, I had no choice but to become a captain.\n\nWhen I looked at the unit roster that was given to me, I saw that the unit is consisted of three female knights, including myself, for a total of four members.\n\nThe two female knights were 17 years old. and the other female knight was 19 years old (my teacher).\n\n“Um, …… they are all older than me.”\n\n“But they’re all beautiful, you know?”\n\n​“I’ll do my best!”\n\nAlthough I said that. I wonder if they will have any complaints about them being made subordinates to someone as young as me?>"
