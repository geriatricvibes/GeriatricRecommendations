	"description": "Xu Nian’s mother was sick, and as they were a normal single income family, they used up all their money to pay for her hospital fees. It wasn’t enough. Xu Nian was a young, good-looking but also very poor university student who was trying to look for a way out.\r\n\r\nCheng Chen was a domineering CEO. He just dumped a lover, and is looking for a new one…and this time he wants a male one.\r\n\r\nThey meet, and fit each other’s needs quite well. And as the cliched script goes, they enter into a give and take relationship–no love or feelings involved.\r\n\r\nBut…\r\n\r\nWho knew that the domineering CEO had such a cute habit!\r\n\r\nNote: The titular Sewing Machine, is referring to the ML, Cheng Chen because of his leg shaking habit. The shaking is kind of like a sewing machine’s needle going up and down, up and down.>"
