	"description": "In her previous life, Alaina read a mind-boggling novel.\r\n\r\nA novel called 「The Curse of The Witch」 is about a witch that torments the male lead by cursing him, and then she meets a miserable end.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally the male lead, Nicklaus, was Alaina’s favorite character.\r\n\r\nOh, and, the world that she was reborn into was inside that novel.\r\n\r\nThe brief happiness of meeting her favorite character aside, Nicklaus began courting her in search of true love to break his curse.\r\n\r\n“All of my firsts are yours.”\r\n\r\nAlaina only shrugged her shoulders as if nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to try harder in the future. I am not that kind of person who easily gives their heart.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll easily give you all of my heart.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t wait.”>"
