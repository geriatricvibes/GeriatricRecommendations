	"description": "The man started kissing his way down his lover’s neck.\n\nLittle Shou: Don’t go below the neck! It will get locked!\n\nThe man stopped one inch below the neck.\n\nLittle Gong felt a little relieved. It seemed that one inch below the neck was still allowed.\n\nBut Little Gong’s lips uncontrollably froze and returned to the original place.\n\nNo, it got locked.\n\nBecause of the rule prohibiting any love scene with below-the-neck action, Ye Ming’s novel was locked. Just when he was feeling quite depressed about it, his manuscript-in-progress suddenly rebelled against him.\n\nWhat the? The second male lead complained that the “action” was too slow and refused to play his role anymore? In a rage, Ye Ming decided to transmigrate into his own novel when he was given the choice to do so.\n\nHe transmigrated into the home of the villain boss’s main henchman before the henchman turned evil. Ah, this henchman was so handsome! Feeling guilt over how he wrote such a miserable story for this person who had lacked warmth since childhood, Ye Ming wanted to shower him with fatherly love.\n\nThe problem was, this cultivation novel that he had written suddenly turned into a BL novel, but the rule that prohibited “any love scene that goes below the neck” was still being enforced!>"
