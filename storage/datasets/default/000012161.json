	"description": "Don’t know since when there was a box inside the elevator in the corridor.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary cardboard box, a bit large, placed neatly against the wall in the corner of the elevator and occupied nearly a quarter of the space.\r\n\r\nThe box wasn't sealed shut.\r\n\r\nIt was dark inside, who knows what was inside of it.>"
