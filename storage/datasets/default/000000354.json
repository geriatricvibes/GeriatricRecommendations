Written by Yoshiyuki Tomino of Gundam fame.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist Chris is abruptly whisked away to a parallel world called Byston Well while his physical body remains in his home world. Chris' spiritual manifestation travels to a new world, where he is thrust into a rebellion. Chris is told that he has a mystical power called 'Garzey's wing', which causes large wings made of light to come out of his ankles, allowing him to fly and run quickly. >"
