That was, to fulfil the promise he had made with his sister. Yuya pursued happiness as the second son of a noble family――Lyon’s life had only just begun...\n\n――What? Because I’m the son of a mistress I’m forced to live alone away from the main house? Forbidden from studying? A political marriage has been decided for me? If that is the case how can I freely pursue my happiness??\n\nFeeling he was cheated by fate until one day, he met a girl. The story of a boy pursuing happiness and his sisters with no self-respect starts now.>"
