	"description": "Carmelita Montecarlos was the youngest daughter of San Alfonso’s wealthiest family, while Juanito Alfonso was the son of the most powerful and influential gobernadorcillo. An agreement solidified their love future. They were bound to fall in love, which an agreement guaranteed. They were to marry on the day of Carmelita’s 20th birthday.\n\nHowever, on the day of their grand wedding, Juanito was shot. Nobody knew who had done it. Everyone assumed that this would be the end of their tragedy. That just like their souls, their tragic romance had gone to the afterlife. But fate had different plans.\n\nThe laws of nature will bend. After more than 104 years, Carmela, the fourth generation of the Montecarlos clan, will be born on a leap year — the same day Carmelita was born. A short trip to San Alfonso for her 20th birthday will give her rebellious life a whimsical twist. Through a diary, she’ll go back in time and the Carmela of 2016 will meet Juanito of 1892.\n\n>"
