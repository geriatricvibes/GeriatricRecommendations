	"description": "As an Internet anchor in this new era, Tang Xia could bear the loneliness and beat the mistresses, marching on the way to “punish the heroines of the original novels” without hesitation. Unfortunately, God failed her courage, and she met a hero with a bug in her first time live broadcasting. It said that the plot should be romantic and touching, but why did the boss ask her to brush the toilets and call her a washboard? \n\nOn the principles of humanitarianism, she could fight against supporting actresses and girls like Virgin Mary. “My tyrant boy, do you fall in love with me?”\n\n“You’re not a human of this world?” Her hidden secret was uncovered, while the fans tried their best to help her find ways to conquer the hero! \n\nThe tyrant hero showed out all his masculinity! He time-traveled to all the worlds where Tang Xia accepted missions. \n\n“I don’t want to go to Philippines to plant bananas!” \n\nThis is a story about Tang Xia’s miserable and mysterious anchor career life.>"
