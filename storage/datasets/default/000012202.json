	"description": "Set in the same world as the Harem Series, this novel was written before it.\r\n\r\nThis novel tells the story of how one of the major players in the setting (of the Harem Series) came to be. By pure coincidence, the most recent novel in the Harem Series is something of an epilogue to this story. The first chapter is a summary of this book's events, but it retcons some things to better fit the lighter tone of the Harem Series by making certain events a little more consensual. For example, the retconned version has Selune initially scare Malicia off by having sex with his maids in front of her instead of what you'll see here.>"
