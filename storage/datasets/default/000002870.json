How will they go about finding her true cause of death?\n\nHalfway through a phone call, there were sounds of a struggle. Did the phantom lurking on the campus really swallow those girls?\n\nMedical Examiner Doctor Qin personally takes up the scalpel, diving into the cases. Reaching a whole new level of shock and suspense! \n\nThe barren mountain corpse, murder at the gates, campus forbidden ground, road of spirits, floating on top of the water, flying through the skies… every case will keep you on your toes, unable to sleep!>"
