	"description": "From the moment I realized, I was a silver-haired, five-year-old girl. I’m off to a great start…. not.\n\nIt seems that I have reincarnated into a fantasy world abounding in magic. At first I was quite shocked, but then I started thinking, could my soul be experiencing some sort of bonus stage after death? If this isn’t a dream, then I need to enjoy myself to the fullest!\n\nUnfortunately, the world isn’t seeing it my way. My family life is oh-so-great with my new parents’ pending divorce and with a menace living in my house that is no joke. Why is it like this? If I don’t do something, how am I supposed to enjoy this wondrous world of witchcraft and wizardry?\n\nAnd this is how Alice’s story begins.>"
