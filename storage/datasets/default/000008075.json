	"description": "It was in the spring of Minato Kujo's second year in high school. Enrolled a stunningly beautiful student, Airi Ninomiya. With her silver hair and blue eyes, she became the topic of conversation at the entrance ceremony. And the girl, Airi Ninomiya has decided to move in with him.\r\n\r\nMinato has a featureless appearance, but he is more attentive to Airi than anyone else.\r\n\r\nOutside the house, Airi has a forced smile or no expression, but at home, she shows varieties of them.\r\n\r\nThey live together in a small room of only six and a half tatami mats.\r\n\r\n'Hey, Kujo-senpai, can you pat my head a little more?'\r\n\r\n'Yeah, as much as you want.'\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a boy who feels he has to care for someone he thinks is important, and a girl who was sick and tired of interacting with others because of her captivating appearance. The story how they became irreplaceable to each other.>"
