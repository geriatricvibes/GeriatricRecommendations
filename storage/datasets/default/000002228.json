	"description": "A ball was held at the manor of the Kingdom's prime minister. At the ball, there was a young lady who knocked down the crown prince. Her name is Elizabeth Clanetta. She is the daughter of Duke Clanetta, one of the most prominent aristocrats in the kingdom. She is a pretty girl with memories of her previous life as a man, a wealth of knowledge learned from her grandfather, and a strong will that can be described as caustic.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a girl who shines like a sunflower changes the kingdom and the world.>"
