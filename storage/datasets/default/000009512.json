Let the Kenpachi Zaraki team handle that.” Pulkit smiled.\n\n“Your Majesty, the Four Emperors came to attack!” Another soldier panicked.\n\n“Don’t mess, go and call the dragon!” Pulkit smiled.\n\n“Your Majesty, the revolutionary army united with the world government and the world’s pirates all over!”\n\nAnother soldier was alarmed. Pulkit wears the Pluto God clothes, pick up the sword around, his eyes turned into Rinnegan, stood up and sneered, “just right, today they will be wiped out.”>"
