	"description": "This is a story about a Criminal Police Department Captain who had crossed into the world of the Red Mansion and made a name for himself as Sun Shaozong, the famous detective. \r\n\r\nThe leading role of the story was originally the Jia's family. However, with this newly passed-through character of the Captain from the modern world, he started a brand new story. \r\n\r\nHe was not interested in reciting poetry, did not like to get involved in family conflicts, and did not care about the imperial examination. All he was interested in was solving cases. He became famous in officialdom with his ability to solve cases, and interpreted the Red Mansions from the perspective of a real man!>"
