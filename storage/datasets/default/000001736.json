	"description": "Everywhere Leticia went, she was compared to her siblings. \nSadly, it was all too common. \n\nShe was not as pretty as her second sister Diana, \nnor as smart as her third brother Emil, \nnor as good with a sword as her fourth brother Xavier,\nnor as talented with magic as her youngest sister Irene. However, she was never jealous or envious of her siblings. \n\nIn fact, she was proud of them. And yet, she never knew that her family was ashamed of her. Until the moment her family abandoned her.>"
