	"description": "The Movie Star Chen Yi got hit by a billboard and passed out.\n\nWhen he woke up, doctors and journalists were surrounding him, only to hear him say:\n\n“Kind ladies and sirs, I am the humble monk Tang Sanzang, who just returned from the journey to the West and received the precious scriptures from the Gautama Buddha.”\n\n“Amitabha, the humble monk never deceives others. What do you mean by saying ‘movie star’?”\n\nChen Yi’s agent, Sun Kong, was more than anxious: what should he tell the company and the press about Chen Yi?\n\nNot to mention Qian Xingmo, a millionaire who had kept Chen Yi as his secret lover for a year!>"
