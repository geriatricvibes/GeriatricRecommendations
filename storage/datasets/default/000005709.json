	"description": "No matter how hard you work, you'll never beat a genius. \r\n\r\nI spent my whole life fighting against that fact, but, one day, I suddenly died in a car accident. I died, never having been rewarded for my hard work. But when I woke up, I was in a different world! \r\n\r\nI was reborn as the eldest son of the Fahrenheit family in the Hylante Empire. What's more, I had a strange Skill: [Practice Makes Perfect]. Thanks to that Skill, if I put in a certain amount of effort, I'll always receive an equal reward! \r\n\r\nHard work... will never betray me again! >"
