Due to the nature of my previous job, I’m accustomed to animals and I can get along with monsters.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I want to live my life while making the people who dragged me here and treated me badly regret doing so.\r\n\r\n——————–\r\n\r\nRio Akizuki was summoned to another world but when she was there, she was labeled as a mistake and average. They cast her off to the side! She will try her best to make them regret it, no matter what!>"
