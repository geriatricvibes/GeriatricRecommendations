	"description": "At the age of 18, everyone is given a skill. The son of the Sword Saint – Arios Macba was expected to be given the strongest skill. However, the skill given to him was “Cheat Code Manipulation”, which was thought to be a miss skill. On the other hand, an orphaned child who was present at the scene developed the skill of the “Silver Sword Saint”, and Arios’ father tried to take him in. In fact, even when Arios activated his skill, it could only increase his attack power. Because of this, he is banished from his family home… but with each battle, he learns too many powers one after the other, and he literally learns to use all kinds of cheats. What’s more, he has become friends with the Second Princess…?>"
