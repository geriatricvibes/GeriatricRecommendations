	"description": "The Crown Prince of Strass, Levnoad, signs a truce with the Crown Prince Giscard of El Pasher. Later, he was poisoned on his way home, and reincarnated as a slave in the countryside of his enemy country El Pasher. Although he had memories and experiences from his previous life, Ray lived contentedly as a slave. Then, one day, Ray is sacrificed as a slave to El Giscard Pasher, who he regarded still young…\r\n\r\n'Did you expect me to be your subordinate? And a greenhorn kid you considered beneath you at that?'\r\n\r\nDespite his disgust and embarrassment, Ray surprised everyone with his unslave-like behavior. Emperor Giscard, who was watching him closely, became suspicious of Ray's identity and kept him in the palace. After a few days of spending the night in the emperor's chamber, Ray was still ashamed to sleep with the Emperor. This was because he was a slave obliged to obey his master, but at the same time he was also Levnoad, the Crown Prince of Strass.\r\n\r\n'It should be a great honor for you to have the emperor's favor. How can you think I humiliated you? Who are you?'\r\n\r\nRay had nothing to say to Giscard, who was trying to turn a blind eye to the truth before him.\r\n\r\nHe just needed to reveal everything without hiding anything. He had to convince himself. Perhaps this is a gamble.\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
