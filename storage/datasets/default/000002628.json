	"description": "Luisen was a lord who wasted his life away after fleeing his castle in the middle of the night during a war. He died experiencing bitter regret, but when he opened his eyes, he found he had regressed back to that night he ran away!\r\n\r\nThere’s no fleeing twice! This time he’s determined not to leave the territory, but to protect it…\r\n\r\nGoing alone to the enemy to surrender himself, Luisen met Carlton, a noble-hating mad-dog mercenary. The two found strange solidarity as unfortunate souls who threw away their life's potential through horrible choices.\r\n\r\n“If I die, so will you,' Luisen said.\r\n\r\nCarlton, who acknowledged the reality of Luisen's statement, suddenly began to think, 'Why is the duke helping me so much?'\r\n\r\nFrom then on, his gaze began to linger on Luisen.\r\n>"
