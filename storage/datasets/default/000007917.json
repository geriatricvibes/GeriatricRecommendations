His name is Ikta.\n\nAs a man, Ikta abhors war, is slothful by nature, and worships the female form.\n\nAt the time, no one could have possibly predicted that a person like him would become a military figure worthy of being called a legendary general......\n\nThe young Ikta, armed with his superb talents as a soldier, struggles to survive in a world ravaged by war. This tale will recount his tumultuous life up until this point, as the curtains are drawn for a spectacular chronicle of fantastical warfare!>"
