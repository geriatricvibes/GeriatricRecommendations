	"description": "I possessed the main character, Geoffrey's beloved fox werebeast in a tragic novel, 'Twist Your Neck While You're Drunk'\n\n“Even if it means destroying all four empires, I will surely make you fall in love with me.”\n\nI just wanted to seduce Geoffrey, the villain, and hang onto him.\n\nBecause I didn't want to die like the original.\n\nI did it, but things are spiraling out of control?\n\nThe man who should've ignored her keeps giving her a soft gaze.\n\n“Did I tell you not to run away from me?”\n\n“If-  if I say I'll run away… … ?”\n\nGeoffrey looked at Mio, who was trembling in fear, and whispered.\n\n“Don’t make me lock you in a cage. Mio.”\n\nWhat…?\n\nThis guy is crazier than I thought?>"
