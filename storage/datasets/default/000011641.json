	"description": "Jobs, hobbies, lifestyles—the world has advanced to a point where nothing can be separated from VR anymore. And now, a VR game was released using the most cutting-edge technologies; its name was “Boot Hour, Shoot Curse.” Our protagonist had no choice but to play solo during the closed beta test, but once the game officially launched, she made lots of friends (but not necessarily the player’s friends), formed a huge clan (but not a clan of players), and matured as an individual.\n\nThe title of this story was just completely random, at first.\n\nIn the middle of writing the story, the title finally became relevant.\n\nWhile coming up with the story, the game’s name was also random. There was no wordplay involved. But just remember: Curiosity killed the cat~\n\nThe star of this story does whatever she wants and treats all other players simply as sources of experience points.>"
