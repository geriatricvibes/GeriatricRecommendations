	"description": "When crossing over to multiple books, Ren Shuhan found that every protagonist Shou was waiting for him to start chasing them in the crematorium.\n\n“Don’t waste your time waiting,” He advised sincerely, “There are more 0s than 1s, so I’m not going to chase someone that is not interested.”\n\nThe protagonist Shou (sneering): Oh, there will be a day where you’ll lick the ground I walk on.\n\nAfter waiting and waiting…\n\nRen Shuhan: “This is the wedding invitation for my childhood friend and I’s wedding.”\n\nOn the wedding night, Ren Shuhan removed the veil: “Baby, I’ve come to marry you.”\n\n“Don’t you know that life is nothing but a play where you are the male lead and I am just a supporting character?”\n\n“I know, but I don’t care.”\n\nHe was smiling, but Jiang Qingyue wept.>"
