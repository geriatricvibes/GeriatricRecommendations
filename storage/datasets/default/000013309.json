Friendliness without reason.\r\n\r\n“If someone harms you, for whatever reason, I’ll get rid of them.”\r\n\r\nAs my defenses dropped one by one, I eventually fell for him.\r\nIt felt like I was truly special whenever he spent time with me.\r\nBut beneath this kind mask, I saw his true self…\r\n\r\n“You can’t leave me. Even if I die— even if you die.”\r\n\r\nThe more I tried to escape, the worse Robin’s obsession became.\r\n\r\n“Just give up. So that I can be kind to you until the very end.”\r\n\r\nWhat am I supposed to do with this lunatic?>"
