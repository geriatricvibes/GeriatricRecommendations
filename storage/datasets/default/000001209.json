	"description": "The engagement between Scarlet, a noblewoman from a ducal family and the Second Prince Kyle was suddenly annulled during the ball.\r\n\r\nShe had been falsely accused of harassing a girl called Terenezza, daughter to a baron, whom the Prince doted on heavily.\r\n\r\nCondemned by everyone around her, forced to burden all manner of crimes, she finally decided enough was enough.\r\n\r\n“Before I leave here, may I ask for one final thing?”\r\n\r\nAs the crowd threw their boos and jeers, and that good looking guy flung his insults──\r\n\r\nHer palm spun like a drill and the ballroom floor was stained with blood.>"
