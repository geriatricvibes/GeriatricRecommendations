He worked hard to pick up girls, but didn’t think……he’d be picked up instead!\n\nShen Yang: I am a straight man.\n\nSu Hanying: Get in the car; I’ll take you to school.\n\nShen Yang: I really am a straight man!\n\nSu Hanying: Here’s my card, buy whatever you want.\n\nShen Yang: ……\n\nViewer A: Su-ge’s driving skills are top-notch! Shen-mei, get in the car!\n\nViewer B: Help! Shen-mei’s about to cheat, go get him, Su-ge!\n\nViewer C: Wow, I’m clearly here to appreciate the romance and drama between hot guys and pretty girls, but why has my sight been stolen by a pair of dog men?\n\nThis is a story about the whole world watching two boys act gay on a dating show, and also the story of a fallen Polaris regaining its light.>"
