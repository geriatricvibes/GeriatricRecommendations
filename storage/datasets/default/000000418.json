	"description": "“I’ll become the greatest maid in the world!”\n\nWith her black-and-white skirt fluttering in the wind, a girl declares her vow. Her name is Melody.\n\nThe girl, a reincarnator of Japanese origin, inherited the dream of her past life and began working as the maid of a ruined count household in the Kingdom of Theolas\n\nShe can transform cheap black tea into a top-shelf drink as easily as she can quickly upgrade a ruined estate into a newly-finished mansion.\n\nFrom household cleaning to serving meals, hunting game to DIY construction, just leave everything to me! Anything’s possibile with the help of all-powerful magic!\n\nTruthfully, this is actually the world of an otome game, and the superpowered, omnipotent Melody is actually the Saint… except she hasn’t realized it yet.\n\n“Falling in love? Fighting the Demon Lord? More importantly, I’ve got chores to do!”\n\nWhat will happen to a world whose savior has put her all into being a maid? How does the world cope when its grand script is discarded in favor of menial labor?\n\nWelcome to a fantasy where a single job has upended the cogs of destiny!>"
