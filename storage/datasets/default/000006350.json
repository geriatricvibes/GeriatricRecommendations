	"description": "Welcome, Kamijou Touma-kun, to the colorful underground!\n\nKamijou Touma meets two girls in Academy City’s back alleys.\n\nOne is Mitsuari Ayu, a lady of Tokiwadai Middle School with the Metal Stinger power to control people’s minds. The other is Kumokawa Seria, a mysterious genius high school girl who can control people’s minds without any power.\n\nKamijou is at the mercy of those girls, but those peaceful times do not last long.\n\nThat kind time is torn apart by a gigantic creature that towers over them: a dragon. Who is the Biohacker who created it, controls it, and freely gives it the power to fight?\n\nWhy is that giant creature pursuing Mitsuari Ayu? Kamijou Touma enters Academy City’s deep darkness to protect the girls.\n\nIt all happened one year ago.\n\nIt is the summer of Kamijou Touma’s third year of middle school. This is an untold story different from the time he spent with Shokuhou Misaki. Kamijou Touma’s starting point begins here.>"
