	"description": "Cecilia, the Villainess, had been condemned and framed by the heroine just like in the story and thrown into a brothel.\r\n\r\nThe first customer who came to visit her was the heroine's childhood friend, a hidden character who immensely adored the heroine, known as the powerful Demon Knight. She did nothing much to harass the heroine, but she believed that he came that far to retaliate, just like the Demon Knight she knew.\r\n\r\nCecilia, who was trembling in fear while trying to desperately do her job, and the Devil Knight, who had been in love with Cecilia and determined to overthrow the throne. \r\n\r\nTheir love story blossomed that night.>"
