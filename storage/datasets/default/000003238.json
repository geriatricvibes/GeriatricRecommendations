	"description": "“I see… As I thought, today was your birthday, Lewin! …Alright! Then, from today, you’re fired.”\n\nFor five years, I was trampled on and oppressed as I worked myself to death for the Healer’s Guild, but on my fifteenth birthday, I was fired.\n\nI wallowed in frustration and self-pity while I despaired… but you can’t eat tomorrow’s fill just by despairing.\n\nIn the Healer’s Guild, I was just the odd jobs boy who was in charge of bookkeeping and classifying the medicinal herbs, but after being fired, my ultimate skill, [Plant Master] blooms.\n\nThis is the story of the dramatic turn of events where the boy who possesses the ultimate [Plant Master] skill climbs up from the very bottom of society.>"
