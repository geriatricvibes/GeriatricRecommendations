	"description": "Grace O’Ellin was set to marry Lucas Blacke, the sexiest and most fearsome man in the entire country.\n\nEvery time they met, her face would go red, her fingertips would tremble, and sometimes, she would straight up hide.\nThere was even one time that she fainted, and as she lost consciousness, she whispered Lucas’ name.\n\nSo, Lucas thought.\nIt looked like his prospective partner in this arranged marriage liked him a little too much.\n\nAnd Grace, as she acted in such a way…\nSomehow, in his eyes, she seemed to be quite cute.\n\n* * *\n\n“Break up?”\n\nLooking as though he couldn’t comprehend what was happening here, Lucas shook his head. The brief question was uttered with a heavy voice, coated with disbelief, like he couldn’t wrap his head around the idea.\n\n“But you like me so much— And yet you’re breaking up with me…? Why on earth have you come to this decision, Grace?”\n\nFaced with her husband’s misunderstanding, Grace cried.\nHow could there be such an expectant—such a certain—expression on his face as he was saying that?\n\nTo be honest, these reactions…\nIt’s because you’re terrifying!>"
