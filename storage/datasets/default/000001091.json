	"description": "“You’re just like a s*ave, Yuta-kun!”\n\nThose abusive words made me rethink myself in a new light. My model ex-girlfriend, my junior, and the best maid of the café all constantly abused me.\n\nI don’t need these kinds of people in my life, nor do I need to force myself to be nice to everyone. From now on, I’ll be honest about what I think and do only what I want to.\n\nWith this decision, my previously dull life was filled with color.\n\n—However, apparently, there’s a reason for their behavior?\n\nThis is a story that starts with forgiveness.>"
