	"description": "Pick up a cheap master,\n\nCultivate ultimate teachings,\n\nSteal a fox to be your pet,\n\nSeduce a demon to be your husband.\n\nTraveling through time and space is not scary, the only thing to fear is a lack of culture.\n\nThey all say that the road of cultivation is long; the best road to walk is the road that is most suitable for yourself.\n\nThat’s just a lie!\n\nWe traveled through time and space, we will walk other people’s path so that they have no path to walk.\n\nThere’s nothing to worry about if you can’t get tried.\n\nWe can pass some else’s trial and become our own deity.>"
