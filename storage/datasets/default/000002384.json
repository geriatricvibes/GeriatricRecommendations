	"description": "The end of mankind and its doom was right around the corner. Narvas, a giant asteroid, was on the path to colliding with earth. To avoid mankind impending doom, Kiwoo broke through the miraculous odds and  journeyed through the ages of time.\r\n\r\n'...Native Americans?'\r\n\r\nHowever, much to his expectations, Kiwoo arrived in the native lands before the discovery of the New World! For man to survive, civilization needed to develop faster and quicker before the collision of Narvas occurs. Under his guidance, the native land was reborn as an empire of the natives and not as colonial land ruled under eurocentrism.>"
