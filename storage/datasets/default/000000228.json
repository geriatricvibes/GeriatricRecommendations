	"description": "Ren, a ten-year-old orphan, was en route to being delivered to a corrupt merchant. However, bandits attacked the carriage she was on and caused it to plummet down the sides of a cliff.\n\nThe impact of the accident unexpectedly awoke her memories from a past life - she was once from a world called Earth, a researcher in his mid-thirties who had died in an explosion resulting from an experiment gone awry.\n\nAccording to her new memories, she was born in another world and grew up in an orphanage. In order to escape a miserable future, Ren will draw upon the knowledge from her past life to create new forms of magic and survive.>"
