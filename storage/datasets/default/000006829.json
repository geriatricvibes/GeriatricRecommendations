	"description": "The world centers around completing Dungeons. Sung Joon, nicknamed the Legend, for his pathetic healing abilities, is a C-Rank Healer with combat abilities worse than an E-Rank Hunter. One day, while traversing through a dungeon with his party, he finds a sword stuck in an altar. No one is able to pull out the sword but as soon as he approaches it, a cruel test begins. His only hope is the sword. However when he pulls out the sword, he learns of a life that isn’t his, swordsmanship that isn’t his, and his life changes forever. How will the weakest Healer become the strongest Swordmaster?>"
