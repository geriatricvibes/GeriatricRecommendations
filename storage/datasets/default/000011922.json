	"description": "​​​​Jiwei was determined to become a world-class pâtissier, but unfortunately, on his way to an award ceremony he died in a car accident.\n\nWhen he woke up again, he had already become the famous local tyrant of a village. He had also bought a ger to be his s*ave and servant.\n\n​Rebirth through transmigration? Men can have children? Jiwei thought that this was preposterous.\n\nBut when his shop regained it’s former popularity in this world, Jiwei felt that this world didn’t seem all that bad.>"
