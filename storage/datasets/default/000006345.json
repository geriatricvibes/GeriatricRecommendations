	"description": "Ruan Zhizhi looked at him like this. She thought to herself: Even if Shi Yan had a mental illness, it didn’t matter. In this world she would never find another man who loved her like him.\n\nThe love he gave her was hidden, but also deep.\n\nRuan Zhizhi knew that the relationship between her and Shi Yan was no longer one-sided. Just like he couldn’t live without her, she also couldn’t live without him.\n\nA very long time ago, during that chance encounter at the hospital, she had asked Shi Yan if he needed to get his medicine. The other party shook his head and said he already found it.\n\nThe rest of her life would be very long, and she was willing to always be his medicine.>"
