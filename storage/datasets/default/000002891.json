	"description": "Likes to act cute, likes to put on a facade, and likes to act stupid even more.\r\n\r\nIntelligence 999, combat prowess 999999. No matter if you believe it or not, I am not exaggerating.\r\n\r\nFlat chests are evil, big breasts are justice. Most favourite type is Queens that are black-bellied and straightforward.\r\n\r\nNot knowing how to pick girls up, being in a romantic relationship is a hassle.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I’m good at everything and the world is there for me to play with.\r\n\r\nI’m a crazy man, I’m a moron, I’m an idiot, I’m eccentric. I admit it because I dare to say it.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied? Come and bite me!\r\n\r\nDifferent from all of you.\r\n\r\nI’m the man that stood at the top of the food chain.>"
