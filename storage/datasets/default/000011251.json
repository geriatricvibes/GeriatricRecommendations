In this world when one reaches adulthood, they are granted “jobs” like swordsman or magician by divine revelation, among them the one said to be the strongest is magic swordsman.\r\n\r\nAlsrod is the illegitimate second son of a small feudal lord, and the seat is already succeded by his elder brother who already put him in the front lines, he’s in a position that could lose his life on the battlefield any day. If he became a magic swordman, a job that was possesed by the famous heroes of the past, he could change his situation.\r\n\r\nHowever the job that’s granted to Alsrod is not magic swordman nor any of the other common jobs, it was a mysterious job called “Oda Nobunaga” that none of the temple’s people knew anything about!.>"
