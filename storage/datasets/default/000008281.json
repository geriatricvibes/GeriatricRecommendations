	"description": "The man I saved destroyed my country with his own hands.\r\n\r\nI still remembered the day when I was given the title “Consort Yu” and my husband was kneeling outside of the palace for the night.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be New Year’s Eve that day, and there was a heavy snowfall.\r\n\r\nXu Tangan told me that he would treat me better than anyone else.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nI could seek his power and status, but I must not seek his love.>"
