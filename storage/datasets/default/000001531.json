	"description": "Volk served as the kingdom's Royal Architect, making use of the magical architecture knowledge inherited from his teacher, but one day he was suddenly dismissed with false accusations.\r\n\r\n'Your construction costs are too high. You're obsolete because there are cheaper people and methods available. Volk, we know you were inflating the material costs and lining your pockets. You will be exiled to the uncharted island!'\r\n\r\nVolk warns them that if he is banished, all the infrastructure in the royal capital will fall into disrepair and become non-functional, but he eventually accepts his exile in resignation. Using his magical construction techniques, Volk develops the island, finds cute and fluffy magical animal companions and attracts the attention of the princess of the Dwarf Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs the exclusive Magic Architect of the Dwarven Country, he wields his skills to make the island prosperous.>"
