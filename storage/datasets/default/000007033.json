	"description": "Crown Prince Lee Geon, the gem of the Korean Royal Family, was an unrivaled descendent and the owner of Gyeongbokgung Palace.\n\nJo Yoo-yeon was a beauty whose delicate gleaming eyes enchanted him and took his breath away.\n\n“Seeing the level of lies you are sprouting, I’m curious.”\n\n“I’m sorry…”\n\n“What have you seen and heard so far? And why did you hide it?”\n\nShe felt as if her heart was about to explode. Her chest felt heavy as if she was suffering from a disease she was not aware of.\n\n“This is the first time in royal history… What a fake marriage.”\n\nHe was furious.\n\nSix months ago…\n\nShe cheated on the most famous man in Korea to get married to him.\n\nTo be exact, to the 30th king of Korea.\n\nTo the Crown Prince Lee Geon.>"
