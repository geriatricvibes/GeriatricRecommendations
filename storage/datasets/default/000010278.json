	"description": "Hio is a ten year old boy who was brought into an orphanage because their family went bankrupt.\n\nSeven years passed since then.\n\nLiving in a poor community and having all women near him mysteriously killed. What mystery lies ahead of him?\n\n****************\n\nWherein Hio escaped from the orphanage and lived in the streets for almost a year until he met Coffee and became best buds with him. Tired of living in the squatter's area, the two 'auditioned' for a band and became members of Equinox that later got turned into Forlorn Madness or ForMad because of a cheeky bratty doll-like woman who is the replacement for the former vocalist. \n\nSeems simple right?\n\nUnless you count that aside from Hio and Coffee, the rest are vampires.>"
