	"description": "My family and my husband killed me. Because of the inheritance.\r\n\r\nReturning to the past, I made up my mind.\r\n\r\n“I have to protect my life and my inheritance.”\r\n\r\nGrand Duke Lapireon of the cursed family. I offered him, who was not interested in property and women, a one year contract marriage.\r\n\r\nNow, all we have to do is get a divorce…\r\n\r\n“Lady, do you think you can leave me now?”\r\n\r\nMy husband is weird.\r\n\r\n“Would you like a land or a mine? Or an empire?”\r\n\r\n“Sasha, did Theo do something wrong?”\r\n\r\n“Mom, don’t leave me.”\r\n\r\n“Sister… I can’t live without you.”\r\n\r\nEven my in-laws began to obsess over me.>"
