	"description": "What the hell? That menace who bullied me since I was six years old, actually became a pretty girl after three years of living apart? And she even ran to our agreed duel location to confess to me, hoping that I can become her boyfriend?!\n\nThis is a plot against me! There’s definitely an enormous conspiracy behind this! I won’t be fooled by you! Even if you tear up and act all pitiful, I will still disregard you and humiliate you, until you've have completely paid back all my childhood grievances!\n\nWhat’cha lookin’at? There are very reasonable grounds for bullying a girl!>"
