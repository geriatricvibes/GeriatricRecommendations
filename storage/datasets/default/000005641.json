	"description": "The symbol of the Apollinerian Empire is none other than the ‘bird’!\r\n\r\nThere was a legend in the empire that held birds as sacred and worshiped…\r\n\r\n[On the day the (Divine Bird), made of silver and gold descends to this land, the empire will have everlasting glory.]\r\n\r\nIt was a trust that came down from the distant past.\r\n\r\nEach interpretation was different, but people waited for the ‘(Divine Bird)’ to come down to this land one day.\r\n\r\nOne peaceful day, hundreds of years later. A fist-sized “egg” from heaven descended onto this land.>"
