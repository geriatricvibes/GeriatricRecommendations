	"description": "Tang Xin was the top first pharmacist of the Federation.\n\nAfter her death, she traveled to a parallel world, planning to make a fortune by relying on hundreds of prescriptions in her mind. Inadvertently saved High-cold (superficial) male god as a guard/an escort. The male god said that he could not only beat the hooligans but also go up to the hall, down to the kitchen, and into the bedroom.>"
