	"description": "Pain, Pain, Go Away is a novel by Sugaru Miaki, also known as Fafoo, author of Starting Over and Three Days of Happiness. Unlike Miaki’s previous two books, Pain, Pain, Go Away is not a rewrite of any story posted to 2ch, but an entirely original one. \n\nThe plot involves a young man who becomes a killer (by accident) – but his victim has the power of “postponement,” temporarily delaying her death.>"
