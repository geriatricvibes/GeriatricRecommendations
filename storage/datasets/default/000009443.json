	"description": "[The Uncrowned King], [Ruthless overlord], [All-powerful Genius], [Master of Alchemy],[Friend to all Females], [A born Gigolo]...Tang En had many titles under him, but what the people truly loved to talk about was his [Demonic Flag Remover] title. \r\n\r\nThe Queen of the elves wants to bear his child, the vatican's saintess is his maid and the empire's princess wants to elope with him. \r\n\r\nBut his only concern was his delusion of taking down the creator of the world!>"
