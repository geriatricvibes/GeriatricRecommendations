	"description": "Noble status, dazzling appearance, and unparalleled talent.\r\n\r\nThe life of a princess, who had all these conditions that could not be modest, was solid.\r\n\r\nI’m self-centered?\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\nIt’s a life lived without caring about the regard of others.\r\n\r\n“Look at this white fur. It’s like a snowball. Fluffy.”\r\n\r\nWho dares to touch me frivolously?\r\n\r\nNo matter how much I shouted, I couldn’t reach the dazed-looking maids.\r\n\r\nEristella, the most capable woman of all time, was cursed and became a small fox.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t too bad that the people of the Grand Duchy, who used to grind their teeth when I was a princess, showed affection.\r\n\r\n“Eristella.”\r\n\r\nThe foe-like fiancée, who I most wanted to avoid, said,\r\n\r\n“Should I call you by a proper name?”\r\n\r\nBefore he discovered my identity.>"
