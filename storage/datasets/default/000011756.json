	"description": "My country’s fourth prince has apparently fallen in love with me at first sight. His Highness said so himself, with a calm and expressionless face. I love you so much that I can’t even sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThat can’t be. Love at first sight? I know of no such thing. No, no, no.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, this prince suddenly came at me with a marriage proposal.\r\n\r\nI’m a freeloader living with the Viscount’s family, now married to a prince because of some dubious, ulterior motive. This is the awkward story of the love cultivating between me and the prince.>"
