	"description": "“Even if it’s a contract, a bride running away on the day of the wedding. Are you afraid of the night already?”\n\n A world you don’t know as soon as you open your eyes,\n\nfrom marriage to a duke like a male lead and first night.\n\nSasha tries to escape and is caught by the duke.\n\n She said, “Please don’t beat me and stop accepting me.”\n\nThe opponent is Duke Kyler, the most handsome and powerful man in the empire.\n\nIn her shock and confusion, Sasha was slapped(?).\n\nOn her face by the sculpted lips that spit out with a look of indifference.\n\nIt’s not a contractual relationship, but every night I get more and more seduced by him… \n\nNo, so what’s the deal?>"
