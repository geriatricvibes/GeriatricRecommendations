	"description": "An Xin, a young girl whose parents were divorced, had been living with her father since forever. When she was twelve years old, her father had to move to an African country for business. So he sent An Xin to live with her mother who had been living alone. \n\nHer mother lived in a remote mountain village. A village far away from the city but very rich. Her old house was large, quiet, elegant, and a little creepy. \n\nOne day, An Xin went into her mother’s study and found a thick, tattered, and red notebook. Out of curiosity, she flipped it open and soon walked into a world with horrors and mysteries. >"
