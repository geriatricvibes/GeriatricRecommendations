	"description": "On the way home from work, I was summoned to another world to be a Miko, along with a young man I just met.\r\n\r\nHe had good, strong abilities, perfect for the role of Miko, and thus had to carry the expectations of the world alone.\r\n\r\nI, meanwhile, with my lesser abilities, had to somehow survive in a foreign world after leaving everything I knew behind. >"
