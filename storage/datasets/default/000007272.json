	"description": "A world with only males which summons their wives through reincarnation by the use of a ceremony. And summoned to such a world, a ‘man’ which was a ceremonial failure. The husband has a muscular structure of a bouncer and looks somehow scary. Am I going to give birth to this guy’s child? Or rather, do I have to? But you know, we both have no interest in our fellow men at all. If so, then it should be fine even if I don’t do it. I want to aim for a peaceful everyday life where I soothe my husband with home-cooked meal and make him forget about doing it>"
