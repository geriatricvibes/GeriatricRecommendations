	"description": "The protagonist has reincarnated into the body of the capture target’s dying younger brother in the fantasy ADV otome game, “Trickster Dreams in the Mirror.”\n\nThough the sickly protagonist regains the memories of his former life, his personality did not carry over. This is the story of a supporting character whose only role was to die, breaking flags so that he may struggle to live even a little longer. As a result, this is a story of a slightly different flag that was broken.>"
