	"description": "A dress only master tailors could create, an enchanted dress for witches: [Magic Dress].\n\nFascinated by witches since childhood, Hino Soujiro came to Alstroemeria Academy to become a master tailor.\n\nWith the apprentice witch Chloe, he devoted himself to making dresses. But contrary to his expectations, he couldn’t make a mark amidst the outstanding students.\n\nSoujiro grew impatient. But because of a one-off utterance from Chloe, he began thinking anew of the “reason I create dresses…?'\n\n“It is a dress that carries forth my feelings.”\n\nThe truth they both know is the link to the future.>"
