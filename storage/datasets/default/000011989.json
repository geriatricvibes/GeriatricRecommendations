	"description": "It’s a world where magic existed a long time ago, but now it has been lost.\r\n\r\nOne day, the protagonist Alan, who makes a living by stealing magic relics, discovers a 『magic wand used by the Great Hero』, but at the same time, he is sent back in time to the past era where magic existed.\r\n\r\nAlan, who has no attachment toward the original era, set aims to build a fortune in the magic era. To do so, he seeks out the Great Hero, the bearer of the wand, and tries to sell it at a high price.\r\n\r\nHowever, the 『Great Hero』 he encounters is an incompetent and useless girl who is hardly the outstanding figure of later times.>"
