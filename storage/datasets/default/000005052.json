	"description": "Hua Manman never thought that she would transmigrate into a popular novel about harem fighting, and even become a female cannon fodder character in this novel.\n\nShe tried to make her counterattack, but found that so long as she went against the flow of the novel, her heart would hurt like it was being stabbed by knives.\n\nIn that case, she might as well just lie on the ground like a salted fish!\n\nBut what she finds incomprehensible is the question,\n\nWhy does His Highness Prince Zhao, who is known for being vicious and treacherous, like to always stare at her?\n\n……\n\nThis Prince Zhao one day found that something seemed to be wrong with his ears.\n\nSo long as he stares at a person, he will be able to hear their innermost thoughts.\n\nFor instance, right now.\n\nHua Manman, whose tears are like raindrops on a pear blossom1: “To be pampered by Zhao Wangye2 is truly a blessing brought by the karmic fortune of my past life!”\n\nHowever what she thought in her heart was actually —\n\n“God damn, the hot chili oil from today was a bit too much! It’s got me crying so hard I can’t stop it.”>"
