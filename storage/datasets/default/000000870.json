	"description": "Reading books and reciting poetry makes one a scholar, holding a sword and breaking through enemy lines makes one a sword immortal.\r\n\r\nFarming to make oneself happy, playing chess and the sheng to make oneself entertained, practicing the sword to make oneself strong.\r\n\r\n“I seem to be weak, but I merely do not wish to bully others. Therefore it is still better for you to not provoke me.”\r\n\r\nEven though a scholar is neither tough nor overbearing, he will occasionally make a move. Yet this will also make his righteousness rise and his reputation shall soar in the passionate Xianxia World.>"
