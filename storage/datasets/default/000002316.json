	"description": "What can a cat do in a apocalyptic world where zombies are rampant?\n\nFang He, who was reborn as a cat, held a small dried fish and seriously pondered over his cat life.\n\nIn the middle of the night, with his cat claws, he scratched a blood-red decree on the wall. He thought that his poop shoveling official would prepare for endless supplies and dried fish.\n\nWho would have thought that his poop shoveling official would become a zombie on the first day?!\n\nFang He’s first reaction was to escape, ah ah ah ah ah~\n\nHmm? Don’t rub my tail, don’t scratch my ears, not even my chin!\n\nPurrrr…Don’t forget my tummy!>"
