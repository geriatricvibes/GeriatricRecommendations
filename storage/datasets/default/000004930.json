	"description": "Fei Bai discovered through his boyfriend’s trumpet account that he had been wearing a green hat. Not long after the breakup, he recognized the third party in their school coffee shop.\r\n\r\nThe senior brother is handsome and tall, but it looks like… he’s not a 0.\r\n\r\nWhen Fei Bai thought his ex might be doing zero for love behind his back, he became angry. He decided to take the initiative to seduce this senior brother so that his ex-boyfriend could also experience the taste of wearing a green hat.\r\n\r\nThe sky’s the limit. Fei Bai successfully seduced the third party. He walked side by side with this senior brother on the campus and bumped head-on unto his ex-boyfriend.\r\n\r\nHe thought the moment of revenge was coming, but in the next second, he learned that he had flirted with the wrong person. The senior brother beside him was not the mistress but the former president of his father’s company!\r\n\r\nFei Bai originally planned to apologize and run away, but he didn’t expect to be blocked in front of his home the next day.\r\n\r\nThe man he called senior brother pressed him against the wall and said in a low voice, “You are so good at seducing people. Who would let you go?”>"
