Additionally, the legitimate and illegitimate sisters of hers everyday appears to have eaten gunpowder, and also the prince who comes to find fault with her, the black bellied wangye……. every one of them needs to be dealt with! \n\nDoesn’t matter if in one's own Prime Minister Manor there suddenly occurs a miracle, there’s still a bunch of green tea b*tches and white lotuses outside.\n\nIf there are no props I will make them, if there is no manpower I will make the move myself.\n\nDon’t assume those evil-doers are fake, they really want a person’s life~>"
