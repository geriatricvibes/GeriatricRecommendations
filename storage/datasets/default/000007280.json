Incidentally, he receives a special skill upon his reincarnation, 『Thief’s Godly Skill (Riot Grasper)』, the attraction of which is the ability to steal skills from others.\n\nHow will a boy, who longs for nothing but ‘cool’, live his life in this otherworld with the Thief’s Godly Skill!?\n\n「Well……aren’t ordinary people boring?\nNo! I firmly refuse!\nFor me! For my sake——\nI can’t run away from this place!!」\n\nWill Seiji make full use of his skill and plunder others, or will he play by the rules——!?>"
