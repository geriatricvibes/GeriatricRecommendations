	"description": "Lain Jang is a lawyer. However, he got fired from the law firm because some crazy client proposed to him. On top of that, he bumped into a new model foreign car, a black Jaguar. The owner of that Jaguar turned out to be the manager of a global star who then hired him when he found out that he was a lawyer. \n\nLain, who thought he could make a living thanks to this, instead gained one more terribly ill-fated relationship. It was global top star Edan Blake. At first he blanked out due to the other’s dreamy looks and voice but he soon learned about his rotten personality  and came back to his senses. This is where his bad luck begins. \n\nHe went there to be a lawyer but after he cleared his head he had somehow turned into the housekeeper of this person who believed that he was the only existence in the entire universe. To make matters worse, an unfortunate accident occurs which even leads him to meet the crazy client who got him fired from the law firm…>"
