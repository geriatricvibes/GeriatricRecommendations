	"description": "“My Euseniel.”\n\nTess, who became an adult, called my name in a soft tone. He smiled, narrowing his eyes, and covered my cheeks with his large hands.\n\nThere were many things I wanted to say when I met my childhood friend, but in the end it was a s*upid question.\n\n***\n\nThe Crown Prince’s only friend, me, Euseniel Hardland.\n\nOne day, our family is expelled from the capital for having had a bad influence on the Crown Prince.\n\nReunited after 14 years, he was very different.\n\n***\n\n“Why… Why did you change so much?'\n\nTess tilted his head, and his black hair, which was obviously blonde, flew down.\n\n“It’s your taste.”\n\nRed lips drew arcs as if seducing me, and the dark blue eyes slowly loosened.\n\n“Because I like you, my Euseniel.”>"
