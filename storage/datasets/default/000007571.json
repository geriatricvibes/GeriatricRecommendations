	"description": "Ling Tian had transmigrated into a web novel and was sworn brothers with the Protagonist.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the plot, Ye Feng, the Protagonist, comes to Ling Tian’s door seeking help entrusting his mother.\r\n\r\nLing Tian immediately said, “Brother Feng, don’t worry; leave Aunt Wanrou to me!”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Brother Feng, leave Bai Yueguang’s Campus Belle to me as well!”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t Brother Feng have too many chances? If you aren’t strong enough, leave them all to me.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, Ye Feng dies with hatred, “Ling Tian, you’re not human.”\r\n\r\nSince then, protagonists have also shown up one after another; The Return of the Soldier King, The Dragon King Son-in-Law, The Supreme Lord, Becoming Rich by Signing-in Daily...\r\n\r\nHowever, before Ling Tian, they were like crops waiting to be harvested.\r\n\r\nFrom that point on, Ling Tian walked the path of a villain.\r\n>"
