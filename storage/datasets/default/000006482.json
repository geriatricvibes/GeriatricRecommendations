	"description": "Tensions between the Kingdom of Xia and the Northwest Barbarians rise as they continue to fight on the border. To maintain a fragile alliance, the ‘Princess’ of peace Xia Xi was gifted as a tribute.\n\nHe thought that the Barbarian King he was supposed to marry was a very old man, but he didn’t expect it to be a hairy boy five years younger than him.\n\nThis is a story in which the little wolf grows up and eats his belated meal thoroughly.>"
