Salirose, the youngest girl of the Sennet family witches, who have the ability to absorb that energy and turn it into magical power, is a failure unable to do so. However, a recently dispatched fort commander, Captain Judius, is the only person whose Inki she can absorb, and it’s incredibly delicious…!
