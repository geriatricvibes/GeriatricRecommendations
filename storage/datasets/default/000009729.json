	"description": "Despite being a Count’s daughter, Risha always had dark circles under her eyes.\n\nIn addition, her skin and hair were ragged, and she was skinny. The dress she wore didn’t match her figure at all.\n\nIn comparison, the daughter of the woman who became the Count’s second wife had a lovely, beautiful face, even though one of her parents was a commoner. Unable to tell which of them had legitimate noble blood, Risha was ridiculed in social circles.\n\nThen one day, someone proposed to Risha.\n\nHe was the Duke of Lindbeld, an exceptionally handsome, straight-laced man.\n\nThe Duke didn’t want to marry, but got annoyed by the people around him who kept nagging him to do so. Moreover, he was tired of the lady who kept hounding him. He was looking for a young lady who would be willing to be his nominal wife, who would not interfere in his work or in his personal life.\n\nSo Risha, who has no interest in the Duke of Lindbeld whatsoever, was selected.\n\nRisha put forward one condition for the marriage.\n\nShe said that she would marry him if he provided her with three meals, a nap, and a minimum standard of living.\n\nIn fact, Risha was always busy and sleep-deprived as a result of her father and step-mother’s work.\n\nShe’d be free from this busyness! How wonderful! She married with tears in her eyes!>"
