	"description": "I’m a demon! A NEET demon who lives off of his two outstanding brothers!\r\n\r\nThen, one day, because I had been slacking off too much in my real job recently, my first brother forcibly sent me to the human world to make a contract with a human.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I figured that if I stayed in the human world long enough, I'd be summoned sooner or later, but then my natural enemy, an exorcist, became a regular at my workplace and started to keep an eye on me. Moreover, this exorcist was one of the most powerful exorcists in this country. He'll definitely kill me if he finds out I'm a demon.\r\n\r\nWhy, just why did this happen… I was lamenting the fact that I couldn't return to the demon realm sooner, before one day, a summoning circle finally appeared right in front of me!\r\n\r\nWanting to leave this place as soon as possible, I jumped in without even checking the destination.\r\n\r\nAnd what greeted me was the familiar face of a certain exorcist.\r\n\r\nThen, I died.\r\n\r\nMy dearest older brother in the demon realm.\r\n\r\nPlease perform my resurrection ritual as soon as possible. Also, I swear that once I revive, I will never go back to the human world.\r\n\r\nI have had enough of scary exorcists.>"
