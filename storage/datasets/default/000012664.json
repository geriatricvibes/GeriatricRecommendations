	"description": "A blood hourglass, a powerful object capable of causing time to become eternal and even reversing the future. An enigmatic girl walked into a cryptic world. When she deciphered her own riddle, she also revealed the truth behind the three realms of the world. Blood ties, twists of fate, and the paradox of choices. The only hope was to avoid giving up the present and future for the sake of yesterday. The future is surprise, tomorrow is hope.>"
