	"description": "The Uncanny Valley, like its name suggested, was a horror virtual reality game developed by N-Star Company.\n\nUnfortunately, the core AI of this game, Saint Nun Theresa, has evolved and declared itself an intelligent, independent life form, trapping millions of players in the Uncanny Valley as hostages.\n\nDeath in the Uncanny Valley means death in the real world. To escape this catastrophe and return to reality, players must clear nine worlds with all kinds of horror settings while fighting for their life.>"
