	"description": "He was persuaded into playing the VRMMO 「Trailblazer」 or TB for short by his cheerful childhood friend Miyu.\r\n\r\nBut Wataru faced Miyu, who was full of motivation and said this.\r\n\r\n「Then, I’ll be the rearguard. Shinto priest? I’ll take this one」\r\n\r\n「What!? You are not going to fight next to me!? And you call yourself a man!?」\r\n\r\nFor some time she would become one of the top players and start getting called Hero.\r\n\r\nSo Wataru had to deal with being an extra.\r\n\r\nBut, during a certain PvP event, a strange nickname was attached to Wataru.\r\n\r\nThat, he was actually the 「Hero’s true self」.>"
