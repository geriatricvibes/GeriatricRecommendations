	"description": "Flum Apricot never even wanted to leave her village. She would've been content to live out her entire life there in peace. But unfortunately, after being prophesied by the God of Creation Origin to join the Hero's party and defeat the Demon Lord, she's known nothing but misery. How is someone with stats of zero like her supposed to be of any use? Her only ability is 'Reversal', and not even she knows what that's supposed to mean. The party's sage, Jean Inteige, is also convinced that she has no right to be there, and he knows just how to get rid of her. Through the depths of despair, when the curse finally 'reverses' itself, what will be left of Flum? And what kind of life will she make for herself?>"
