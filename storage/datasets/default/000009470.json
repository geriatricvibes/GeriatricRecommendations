	"description": "Everyone said that Wen Yufeng was the school bully of No. 1 High School.\n\nCutting classes, fighting, poor grades, smoking and clubbing to make girlfriends, he did all kinds of bad things.\n\nUntil a young talented girl from middle school skipped some grades.\n\n“Brother Yu, the grandsons of No. 3 High School are looking for trouble again! What should we do?”\n\nThe boy flung aside his cigarette, his eyes narrowed, and his handsome face was lazy and ruthless: “Kill them.”\n\nAt night, the fiendish entourage arrived at the door of the No. 1 class.\n\nA slender beautiful girl was standing at the boys’ desk.\n\nHer voice was soft.\n\n“He hasn’t finished his vocabulary, so he can’t go.”>"
