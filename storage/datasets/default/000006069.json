	"description": "My husband whispered sweetly to me,\n“Hurry up and die, Darling.”\n\n‘I, who never lived her life to the fullest let alone loved, am dying like this?’\nMaybe.\n\n‘Was it you who plotted the poisoning?’\n\n[ The 23rd Imperial Emperor, Gloria Blake Vierant, died brutally at the hands of her husband. ] It turned out that he murdered both my father and my friend. I wanted revenge against the husband who mocked us with that gentle face.\n\n“Your Majesty?”\n“…!”\n\nAfter making that eerie vow, my bloody “ex-husband” stood in front of me again. Regression? Past? It didn’t matter. That damn bastard was in front of me as my fiancé once again!\n\n“Marquis Erun Lebossi.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\n\n‘I’ll return your words to you.’\n“Please die, Darling.”\n\nTwo months before the Imperial marriage.\n‘If I don’t do anything, I’ll die at my husband’s hand just like my father.’\n\nNow, I needed to avoid marriage and gain allies. I thought of the perfect one.\n\n“I command you.”\n‘You always avoided me in the past, and even more after I married.’\n\n“Marry me, Kaien Ludenberg.”\n‘I’d rather live a farce with you than marry my husband again.’>"
