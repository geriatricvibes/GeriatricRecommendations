	"description": "Jiang Jinjin transmigrated into a book, a campus story and became the stepmother of the second male protagonist, and throughout the text, the description of this stepmother is very little, with a rough estimate of no more than two hundred words.\n\nThe male protagonist was sixteen years old this year which was the most rebellious period in a person’s life.\n\nThe male lead’s father was thirty-nine years old this year, mature and refined, self-sufficient and unfathomable.\n\nHe was not someone she can handle, so she slipped away.\n\nJiang Jinjin, who was very self-aware, was obsessed with money under the identity of Madam Zhou, but she didn’t expect that along with money, she had to manage the father and son at the same time.\n\nJiang Jinjin was stunned. Does father and son have some kind of weird habits. Obviously she only treated them as her tools.>"
