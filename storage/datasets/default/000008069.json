	"description": "I had possessed a villainess.\n\nThat villainess was called the great madwoman of the Kingdom of Maconia, but I cheered because Rene Blair, the evil woman, had a lot of money!\n\nAlthough she was a character who died in the beginning of the novel, I thought I shouldn’t do anything bad.\n\nI’m going to be nice to everyone from now on. Or live without being involved with the original characters.\n\nSo I tried to do well.\n\n[Today’s mission: slap the waitress on the cheek]\nUntil the crazy translucent mission window popped up.\n\n‘I’m going to be the maid from now on,’ I said.\n\nEither way, I’m a maid from my own mouth.\n\nI raised my palm, muttered as if I had it memorized, and then I hit my cheek.>"
