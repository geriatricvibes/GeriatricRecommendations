	"description": "One day, my little granddaughter asked me, “Grandma, why did you marry grandpa?”\n\nI answered without thinking, “In order to make He Yu regret.”\n\nMy granddaughter didn’t understand, “What do you mean?”\n\nTo understand it, we had to go back to the time I was five years old. We were playing house with the theme of an ancient wedding. He Yu lifted my veil. I winked at him, but he screamed: “Mom, it’s a ghost!”\n\nI vowed to hold my grudges and one day he will regret that he provoked me.\n\nI planned to fascinate He Yu with my beauty. And when he gets crazy about me, I will not marry him. I will marry someone else. He Yu will cry bitterly and fall into madness, as he missed the chance to be with me for a lifetime.>"
