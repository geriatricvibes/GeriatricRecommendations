	"description": "'I suddenly discovered that this world is dangerous today.' Bai Zhi typed a line on the computer with a serious look.\r\n\r\n'When I went out today, I found some poor guy got bitten by someone on the side of the road. After the few brave guys rushed out to bring the criminal to justice, the person who was bitten also stood up staggeringly, but was immediately beaten to the ground by a sharp-eyed fellow. Then they called the police. Having experienced many modern movies, I already knew what happened. The zombie was taken out before the virus could spread.'\r\n\r\n'Last time it was about the alien invasion being dealt with by a few guys, but this time it was a zombie outbreak?'\r\n\r\nThere was a helpless response from the chat box.\r\n\r\n'So how was that dangerous?'\r\n\r\n'There are several girls who are chasing me wanting to split me up! It’s Shuraba, don’t you think it's dangerous!?'\r\n\r\n'???'>"
