	"description": "“I like you. Kageo!”\n\nAt his home’s entrance, the girl ranked number one on the list of people he wanted to kill pushed him down and was sucking his penis\n\nJust, what the hell is this situation!?\n\nAlthough he saved her from falling down the stairs, a sudden expression of love with a fellatio is frightening. Kageo wanted to run away immediately.\n\n“No problem-desu. I will suck more-desu”\n\n“No, Sudou-san, things are already getting bad, though”\n\nIs Sudou-san, a slut?\n\nNo way. Even though she looks so innocent\n\n“Kageo, annoying!! I like you, true!! Believe-desu!”\n\nLalya made a sulky face. Because she was really beautiful, there was a punch when she got angry and it was overwhelming.\n\n“I’m sorry!”\n\nHe apologized and ejaculated at the same time.>"
