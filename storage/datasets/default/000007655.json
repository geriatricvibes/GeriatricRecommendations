	"description": "Having escaped the abandoned Waste Planet and finished off the trafficker that smuggled her out, illegal galactic resident Ai Bei had to find a way to eke out a living while doging the tracker robots and register herself a valid galactic citizenship in this foreign planet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Live-Streaming Transmigration Competition advertisement plastered across the gigantic screen on the skyscraper ahead fell into her vision, Ai Bei, armed with nothing save for a basic personal terminal with incomplete personal details, decided to bet her life on it. Survival of the fittest they say? Well, she lived and breathed that in her entire life back in the Waste Planet.>"
