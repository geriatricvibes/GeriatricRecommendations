	"description": "A third rate actor reborn as a young master.\n\nIt was a story of a hard-pressed, proud return to the entertainment world→ Coaxing the BOSS→ And becoming a King?\n\nIt was just that in the front were the four villainous emperors of the entertainment circle and at the back was the evil and terrifying underworld adoptive father. Facing all kinds of godly competitors and having only a cute but dumb sheep-teammate. For his dreams, he felt he needed to walk down the path of stardom…\n\n[ If you don’t want to fall into the abyss, you need to bend your noble knee to it even if it is trampled under your feet.】\n\nAs if time was frozen and still, as if the sea had dried up and become sand.\n\nSu An suddenly opened his eyes.>"
