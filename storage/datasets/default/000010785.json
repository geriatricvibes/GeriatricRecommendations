	"description": "Feria, the younger sister of a feudal lord from a remote region, is chosen to be the king’s 31st consort… being that the king visits the queen candidates by the order they were appointed, she can only meet him on the 31st of each month. “Am I the queen of unlucky draws or what?” She resigns herself to her fate and spends her time tending to the fields. However, falling in love with the king on their first meeting, her place as the 31st consort becomes the biggest obstacle.>"
