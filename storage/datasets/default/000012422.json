	"description": "Chen Luoyang felt that something was wrong with his transmigration. After transmigrating, he possessed the body of the highest expert in the world, the Master of the Demon Cult, addressed respectfully as the Demon Sovereign.\r\n\r\nGenerally, aren't supreme experts the ones that leave behind a wisp of their soul behind and occupy a new body of some miserable low-level youngster then they go on a journey of revenge and make a comeback?!\r\n\r\nOr perhaps it would be transmigrating into a miserable youngster's body and obtaining a cheat slowly walking the road to becoming a God?\r\n\r\nBut why did his transmigration seem wrong?\r\n\r\nNow my environment is full of big shots and I feel like I'm going to be exposed!>"
