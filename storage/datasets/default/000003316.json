	"description": "She had possessed the body of the no. 1 villainess, who was terrible for tormenting the boy who entered the orphanage.\n\n‘I thought I didn’t need to be involved.’\n\n…But it’s annoying to see him keep being beaten by other children, so I took care of him a little.\n\n“That kid next to me. That kid is also going to be adopted.”\n\n“Am I going to be a foster daughter?”\n\n“No. You are going to be my daughter-in-law.”\n\n…So, I was adopted with the Male Lead.\n\nI can’t just do this? There’s a separate heroine!\n\n*****\n\nThe Male Lead went to war with his new father as scheduled.\n\nWhen he returns, he will be with the original heroine.\n\nI prepared for divorce and dismissal from the family step by step.\n\nIn the meantime, I have earned a lot of money for myself!\n\n“Damian, why are you back here alone? Where are the others?”\n\n“Others?”\n\nDamian’s eyes, who were always soft at my questions, quickly became sharp.\n\n“It’s not right, Ellie. You’re looking for a man other than your husband.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“No way. I’m so jealous, I might kill him.”\n\nI looked at my father-in-law to ask for help.\n\n“The same is true of my opinion, Ellie. Cheating on your husband is not allowed.”\n\n“…”>"
