	"description": "After I died of overwork at a black company, when I woke up I was someone else. And according to the mysterious explanation that suddenly resounds in my head, this world I reincarnated in is a ”romcom world”, and I’m a first-year high school student named Ryusuke Shindo. And when you’re reincarnated in the world of a romantic comedy, it’s standard to have a cute childhood friend, be friendly with the student council president, and have a beautiful girl sitting next to you in class. It’s only natural to expect such vivid youth. But when I stood in front of the mirror, I was a typical “delinquent villain character” with dyed brown hair, multiple ear piercings, sharp eyes, and a stern face?! This is the story of me, who was reincarnated in the romantic comedy world as a villain, and uses all the knowledge and experience from my previous life to avoid the fate of a bad ending that awaits me, and to live a happier youth than the protagonist of the romantic comedy world.>"
