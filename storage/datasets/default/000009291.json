	"description": "“Hello, temptress.”\r\n \r\nCount Cassarius died suddenly because of the plague.\r\n \r\nHe left behind a will for Rietta, a beautiful young widow of his estate whom he tried to take as a concubine before his death, to be buried with him. Just before Rietta was about to be buried, Grand Duke Axias, known as a cruel tyrant, came to the estate. He was there to ask Cassarius to pay back the enormous debt that he had been putting off.\r\n \r\n“Everyone here seems to feel sorry for her, but I have yet to receive my payment from Cassarius. If I took her instead of the debt, everyone would be happier.”\r\n \r\nAxias chuckled and gave a sweet greeting.\r\n \r\n“Hello, temptress.”>"
