	"description": "\r\n\r\n“I want to have something that’s close to the person I like.'\r\n\r\n Prince Lochlan took the ribbon of his fiancée, April, before leaving for the battlefield.\r\n\r\n “I will always tie it to my arm. Thinking of it as my fiancée.'\r\n\r\n And two years later, April heard of his death.\r\n\r\n The fates of the twin princes who resemble each other were torn at the end of the war.  April's fiancé, Lochlan, was dead.  On the other hand, his twin brother, Prince Dominic, returned alive.\r\n\r\n When everyone praised his achievements, April realized an important fact.\r\n\r\n It was not Dominic who came back alive from the war, but her fiancé, Lochlan.\r\n>"
