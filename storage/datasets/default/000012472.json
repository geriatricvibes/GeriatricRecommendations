	"description": "My favorite character in the novel died. \n\nAbandoned by the Heroine and lost his emotions, he could no longer use his abilities, and when he weakened, the North collapsed. \n\nWithout even finding his body, the novel depicts only the happy ending of the main characters. And I possessed the evil girl in the novel,Shuire . ‘I’d rather get his emotions back before he meets the heroine.’ So I headed to the North.\n\n“Duke, could you hold my hand? Or maybe an autograph. I’ll keep it as an heirloom.”\n\n “If you want to get my autograph, the Lady should also sign here ” \n\n“What’s this?”\n\n“Marriage registration form.”\n\nPardon?\n\n“Just like now. It seems that the Lady’s behavior makes me feel nervous.” \n\n…Do I have a chance now?>"
