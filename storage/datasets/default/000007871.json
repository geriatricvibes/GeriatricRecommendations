	"description": "Lu Zhengfei killed Chen Qianqing.\n\nHe disabled Chen Qianqing’s legs, and blinded his eyes, locking him up with chains in his house. Then, he watched with his eyes wide as he died.\n\nInjuries inflicted in the name of love would always end in tragedy.\n\nDid Lu Zhengfei regret it? Of course, he did. And so, God gave him another chance.\n\nBut this time, he found that he himself—became Chen Qianqing.>"
