	"description": "A parody of Snow White.\r\n\r\n“Did the thought of this ever occur to you? The reason why you was chosen out of many princesses in the Marchen? That’s because I felt restless. I was wondering where you would go away, which filthy man you would kiss.”\r\n\r\n“You…!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it called love that you hate and loathe me? Thus, I'm so happy right now.”>"
