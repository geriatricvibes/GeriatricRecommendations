	"description": "Kou Kousaka is an ordinary salaryman working overtime in a black company when a totally unprecedented event happens: he dies and is sent to another world.\r\n\r\nUnlike those other isekai novels where the main character decides to be a hero or a demon lord, Koko here doesn’t care for any of that. The isekai system rewards his lack of choice with several powers which have never been seen before: the ability to store items in a limitless inventory, immediately dismantle them into materials, and then use them to create something new. How will our completely unique hero survive in this new world?>"
