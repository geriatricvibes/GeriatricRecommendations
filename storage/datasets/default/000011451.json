	"description": "Su Tang thought that after completing the mission, she would be able to happily go home to retire. That’s when the system told her that her points have been frozen, the mission worlds have collapsed, and all the male leads have blackened! In order to survive, she could only go back to when the male leads were at their darkest point, and work hard to save them. However, the crimes committed at the time were too deep, now she could only cry and be bullied.\r\n\r\nTyrant: “Naughty little things need to be locked up.”\r\n\r\nOverbearing President: “So damn cute, makes me want it.”\r\n\r\nMarshal: “Delicate and helpless little guide? Ha, no such thing.”\r\n\r\n…to this, Su Tang only wanted to say: “I advise the male lead to be kind.”>"
