	"description": "The young man who had been sold for five pieces of silver coins was the former Crown Prince, the man who broke our engagement eight years ago and destroyed the kingdom. He was a beautiful prince, but is now a shadow of his former self, emaciated, disfigured, and locked in a dirty cage at the slave market. I decided to buy him.>"
