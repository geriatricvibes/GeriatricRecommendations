	"description": "After defeating the Demon Lord who had thrown the world into chaos, the Hero, Raid, found himself in a rough spot.\n\nHe was kicked out of the party he had always thought of as his friends (the ones he had been introduced to by the guild three days earlier), saying, “I can’t keep up with you.” Then, later that same night, he was forcibly transferred to Earth by a self-proclaimed god who said, “You’ve gone a bit overboard, so why don’t you to Earth for now?” And so the hero Raid was forcibly transferred to Earth.\n\nOn Earth, however, he gets addicted to manga and develops a severe case of chuunibyou, and becomes famous as a psychic, sometimes taking on evil spirits, sometimes monsters, and sometimes humans.\n\nThis is that kind of a story.>"
