	"description": "\nThe Crown Prince was cursed to swap bodies with the woman he spent a night with, and due circumstance, I became the daughter of the Duke whose whole family was exterminated because they failed to produce a cure for the said curse. \n\nTo lift the curse, I seduced the indifferent prince and spent a night with him. \n\nAfter ridding him of the curse and giving him the cure, I stopped paying attention to him…\n\n'Princess, it seems you left me because you weren't satisfied that night.'\n\n'....'\n\n'Let's do it again. I'll satisfy you this time.'\n\nAnd to make things worse, the curse that should have been lifted and should have been a closed chapter… was not. Now our bodies would sporadically swap without any warning?\n\nThere was only one way to return to our bodies and that was to desire the other’s body. But— \n\n“Your Highness, why did you rush all the way here?”\n\n“You said you didn’t like being rained on.”\n \n“I am telling you that it was a lie I told to seduce you.”\n\nThe man, who had suddenly changed, covered me with his jacket and whispered, “I would hate myself if I let you get rained on.”\n>"
