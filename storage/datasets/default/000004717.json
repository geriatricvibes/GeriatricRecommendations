	"description": "Her rebirth gave her a second chance at life. She was back with a vengeance and wanted to make those that had harmed her pay. \nTo those that helped her, she wanted to repay them. \nHer evil stepmother? She would slowly pull out her claws, one by one. \nHer evil stepsister? She would crush her pride. \nShe thought that by getting her revenge for her past life, she would be happy in this life. \nHowever, she never would have thought that danger would chance upon her time and time again. The hatred from her clan and whether their bloodline would continue to exist, lay solely on her shoulders. \nLuckily, on this thorny path, someone had always been protecting her. “Third Prince, have you ever regretted being with me?” That person laughed lightly and peered at her with a loving yet weary look, “As long as I am together with you, I have no regrets.”>"
