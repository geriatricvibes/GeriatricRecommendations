	"description": "She had lived as a noble knight all her life, but she could not endure persecution and died at the hands of a blackened demon. \n\nThen, like it was all a lie, she returned to her childhood. Altair made up her mind.\n'...I must protect him from being blackened this time.’ \n\nNontheless... this little demon is tough from the beginning. \n\n'I, am not, the devil. Do you understand?'\nDenying his identity, and saying, 'Damn it! You must think I'm some kind of monster!'\nHe does evil to those who are reluctant to listen to him. \n\nI tried my best to coax him, comfort him, protect him from his enemies, and raise him with difficulty... \n\n'I can give you all the gold, all the knowledge, all the power to bring that emperor to his knees if you wish. So...'\n'Don't ever think of leaving me again. Okay? Never again.' \n\nWhy is he darker than he was in his last life when I met him again?>"
