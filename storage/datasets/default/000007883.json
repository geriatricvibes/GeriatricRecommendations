	"description": "“The sun rises in the East, only you are invincible.”\n\nFrom beginning to end, the only one Dongfang Bubai loved was Yang Lianting. In their past life, even though Yang Lianting coveted power and position, even though he never held him in his heart– But Dongfang Bubai’s love, isn’t it just like this? Falling in love with such a person means not only accepting his good, but also tolerating his evil.\n\nReborn Yang Lianting returned to a time when everything had yet to happen, which gives him the chance to reflect upon himself, to treat Dongfang well and to return him a lifetime filled with happiness.>"
