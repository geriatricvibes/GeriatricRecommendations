	"description": "It's a story of growing up outside the wall.\r\n\r\nOne day, she returns to her original position by the lady who took her, and becomes the heir to a powerful Western family.\r\n\r\nWill I be able to do well? Is this really my original position?\r\n\r\nThe prince appeared in front of Iara who lived with such questions.\r\n\r\n'Hello.'\r\n\r\nBut he was far from the princes in the fairytales she’d read.\r\n\r\nHe was ferocious and unpleasant.\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't be jealous.'\r\n\r\n'Don't call my name. It's disgusting.'\r\n\r\nBut people called him a kind, funny prince.\r\n\r\nShe disliked Illinzer who only took off his mask in front of her.\r\n\r\n'You don't even know my size? You idiot.'\r\n\r\n'What are you saying?”\r\n\r\n'If that’s not it, do you have another guy?'\r\n\r\nHe had begun to approach her little by little, as if he would cross the line someday.\r\n\r\n'Iara.'\r\n\r\nHer academy life became like a dangerous tightrope.\r\n\r\n'Don't look at me like that just because I’m so handsome.'\r\n\r\nBecause of the prince who's a little crazy.>"
