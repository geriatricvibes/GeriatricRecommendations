	"description": "I, Hanabelle Cantar, am the fiance of this country’s second prince, Remnass-sama.\n\nThat is until today.\n\nJust now, I just had my engagement earnestly broken off by the Prince.\n\nYes, yes, today is the day that I have been eagerly awaiting all this time.\n\nMy wish was to become a Librarian in the “Tower of Books,” Biblio Tower.\n\nSince I’ve had my engagement broken off, I should be free now right?\n\n……So why, is Prince Remnass coming to the tower to see me?\n\nHe’s a hindrance to my reading, so I will give it my all to have him allow me to humbly push him out!>"
