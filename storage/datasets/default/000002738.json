	"description": "“Death is believed to be a very terrifying experience. But in fact, it isn’t.”\r\n\r\nKasia Del Roman was a powerful soldier who was nicknamed ‘The Reaper of the Battlefield.’  She had lost her human emotions long ago and lived all her life as a tool. But when all was said and done, she couldn’t even have the privilege to die a proper death.\r\n\r\n‘You have to go back and live another life…’\r\n\r\n A voice, booming and frightening, rang out in the silence.\r\n\r\n“No! Never!”\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes without experiencing the peace she had always craved for. Lo! It was yet another battlefield of an unknown world.\r\n\r\n“Truly a miracle! She is alive!”\r\n\r\n“Bring a stretcher!”\r\n\r\nThus, Kasia starts living her new life as a war machine. However, different circumstances open her eyes to new and unique emotions she had never felt in the past.\r\n\r\nEven so, where will the karma of her past life lead her to?\r\n>"
