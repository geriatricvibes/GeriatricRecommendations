	"description": "Well, mobs.\r\n\r\nIt's been three years since I fell asleep after being caught by the curse of a witch, and during that time, there are dozens of princes who passed through me. That's a good number!\r\n\r\nIf I were a princess, in this time I think at least one of them would have woken me up.\r\nBut the princess nicely avoided the curse because of me!\r\n\r\nAfter three years it was a surprisingly beautiful prince who woke me up. In addition, it seems that the princess was aiming for this prince.\r\nWell, mobs and princesses can't compete.\r\n\r\n――or so I thought, but it wasn't like that !?\r\nThe prince is very kind to me, but I don't want that!>"
