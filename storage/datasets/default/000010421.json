	"description": "Lu Zhou wakes up to become the world’s most powerful and oldest villainous Patriarch, and finds that he has nine notorious disciples who are full of evil. His eldest disciple is the leader of the Nether Sect with thousands of minions, and his second disciple—Sword Devil—always slaughters others at the slightest disagreement…\n\nWithout his cultivation base, how will he handle these evil disciples?\n\nHis eldest disciple, Yu Zhenghai, said, “I’ve never had a rival in my life, and no one but Master can make me bow my head.”\n\nHis seventh disciple, Si Wuya, said, “We can’t eat or sleep in peace as long as the Master is not dead!”\n\n…\n\nHis ninth disciple, Yuan’er, said, “I’ll remember what Master said and be a good person.”>"
