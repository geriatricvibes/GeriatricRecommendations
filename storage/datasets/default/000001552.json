	"description": "He pushed her against the wall. 'You sealed off my Demonic Realm and went to get reincarnated?' \r\n\r\nShe looked awkward and shy. 'I...' \r\n\r\nHe came closer. 'So? How do you intend to make it up to me? Huh?' \r\n\r\nShe felt guilty. 'What...what do you want?' \r\n\r\nHe gave her an evil smile. 'Your punishment will be...to have a bunch of little Demon King babies with me.' \r\n\r\nShe was the queen of the Godly Realm and in a battle between the Gods and Demons, she sacrificed herself to seal off the door to the Demonic Realm in order to save the people. Later, she discovered that this was a well-planned scheme of betrayal. \r\n\r\nShe used the last bit of Godly Power she had to send her spirit back to be reincarnated. She swore to return to the Godly Realm and slaughter that betrayer with her own hands! \r\n\r\nAfter ten thousand years of reincarnating, she finally goes from earth in the 21st century back to that otherworldly realm.>"
