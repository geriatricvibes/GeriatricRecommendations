	"description": "I know that I’m just a mere shadow of that person. I know you don’t love me, I also know that you hate me. I know all along. I’m well aware of it in my heart… Even so, why has it become like this? I’m still unable to let go of you. I can’t do without you. And I hate to part with you. It doesn’t matter that you ignore me, use me as a sex tool for venting, or want to imprison me in hell for atonement. It doesn’t matter, I don’t care. It doesn’t bother me, not in the least. But why does your heart never leave even a little bit of space for me? Do you really hate me that much? Am I so unforgivable? Then in that case Murong Xi, I am willing to obey you, willing to fulfill you, and sincerely bless you, just because I love you so miserably.>"
