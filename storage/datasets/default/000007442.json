	"description": "Lee Young-joon, this narcissistic capable man, was the vice president of Yoo-il Group and was well-known for his good looks.\n\n    His life went by without any hurdles, thanks to his personal secretary/assistant, who had always been so heedful with his businesses. She was a beautiful woman with perfect looks and abilities named Kim Mi-so.\n\n    She had worked for 9 years as his secretary, although the woman also served as his personal driver from time to time.\n\n    Howbeit, Kim Mi-so resigned suddenly. When being asked why, Mi-so said that she wanted to find herself a life-long partner (marriage partner).\n\n    Lee Young-joon didn’t accept that reason. He presented a brilliant solution so that the woman didn’t need to resign from her job: he offered himself to be Kim Mi-so’s husband.\n\n    But, was it really Mi-so’s true reason for her resign?\n\n    Or, was there anything else the woman was hiding? (Cred: Fei斐)>"
