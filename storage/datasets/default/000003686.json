	"description": "I first met him–a man exuding a certain silence–on the station platform at dusk.\n\nI was Joe Sasayama, a medical student. But in another era, I was Andrews Levin of Roadford. \n\nIn both lives, I kept running into this mysterious man in a Chesterfield coat, a terrible sadness in his striking amber-colored eyes. \n\nI would soon discover this man knew so much, almost too much, about our world–including about myself. \n\nWho was he? What did he want with me?\n\nMy heart nearly skipped a beat when he asked me a disturbing question:\n\n“What do you think kills people?”\n\nI hope you’ll join me on a serene, surreal tale of intertwining past and present.>"
