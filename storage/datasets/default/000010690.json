	"description": "“In a land far to the east, there exists a strange store that has rejected a three Michelin star rating multiple times.\r\n\r\nThe prices are expensive. A combo set of soup and egg fried rice costs 288 RMB. Oh, I forgot it also includes a side dish of pickles. Even so, very many people line up to wait.\r\n\r\nThat place does not accept reservations. It only lets in people who are waiting in line there. Countless people make special trips to line up there. Of course, there’s nowhere to park planes or cars.\r\n\r\nTheir service is so terrible, the customers have to serve their own dishes and grab their own bowls and chopsticks, and they even have to wipe down their own tables! God, the boss is simply crazy.”\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                       —《 Michelin Gourmet Magazine》>"
