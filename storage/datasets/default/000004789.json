	"description": "I looped many times.\r\n\r\nMy engagement broke up because I was selfish at the beginning and everyone despised me.\r\n\r\nI tried very hard to change my attitude because I felt it wasn’t good enough, but the engagement was broken anyway.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nNo matter how many times I try, the engagement always gets broken.\r\n\r\nIsn’t fate a cruel mistress? Yes.\r\n\r\nThe story of a young woman who, after being looped for the umpteenth time and having her engagement broken off, finally gives up.>"
