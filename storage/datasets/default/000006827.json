	"description": "I transmigrated into a novel and became the villainess, Serina who comes from the noble Ducal Melford family.\n\nAs a well-to-do character, I tried to mind my own business, but the story had other ideas. A self-proclaimed mother brought back a boy – the duke’s heir and a genius wizard - intent on brainwashing and blackening him. \n\nThe contents of brainwashing are two things: \n\n1. Obey our family. \n\n2. And fall in love with Serina. \n\nThanks to that, the brainwashed twisted yandere is obsessed with me… \n\nI can’t do this. I have to undo the twisted character’s brainwashing! \n\nBy the way, what’s this situation? \n\n“Now that the brainwashing is gone, I’ll do as I please. So Serina, please, let’s do our best.” \n\nI’ve solved his brainwashing… but why does he seem even crazier than before—\n\nDid I make a mistake?>"
