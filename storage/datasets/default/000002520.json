	"description": "He was confused, so he asked, “I have a car, a house, good-looks and money. What am I lacking in?”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “All those attributes are what men use to lure mistresses. So, which of those attributes is a good characteristic?”\r\n\r\nAshamed, he reflected, “I am loyal to one and I can host and cook. I can make the bed and accompany you when you wish to go out.”\r\n\r\nShe replied bitterly, “I shall, reluctantly, accept you then.”\r\n\r\nGood men would not let the women they love fight with the mistress but get rid of them on their own.>"
