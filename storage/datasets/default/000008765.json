	"description": "She crosses over to a different world, and becomes a little six year old good-for-nothing. One day she rises up, with her summoning skills which defies the laws of nature and forbidden magic. Her abilities suddenly astound the world and she disdainfully looks down upon the strong from the mere corner of her eyes.\n\nWhen extreme frivolousness meets up with two-facedness, when a genius squabbles with an evildoer, at that moment, the world trembles because of it!>"
