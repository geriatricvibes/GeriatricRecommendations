	"description": "Yi Ti resented her name.  From an early age, she couldn’t get away from the nicknames “ET” and “alien”.\n\nBut no one thought that one day, she would actually meet an alien. \n\nScared by the other, it seemed like she screamed……\n\nShe fainted, then fell face down or something like that…… \n\nShe seemed to have gotten a bloody nose from being knocked out…… \n\nShe doesn’t remember any of this!!! \n\nThe only thing she cares about is that after she fainted, the alien actually dragged her, chest down, back home – does the alien not feel ashamed?!>"
