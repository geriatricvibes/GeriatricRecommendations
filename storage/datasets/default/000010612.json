	"description": "For the once dead Hua Yu Man, she has to do three things this lifetime: kill those who harmed her, kill the man who said he loved her, and protect a place called “home.”\n\nShe seems docile and gentle, with the air and temperament of a beautiful young lady. But in fact her heart is cold, overbearing, and black belly, with a mysterious identity that can drive the world crazy.\n\nHe is the Thirteenth Prince, but also the country’s disgrace; a cold and ruthless man who doesn’t put human lives in his eyes. But only towards a sometimes gentle, sometimes willful and sometimes disobedient woman, would this man be ceaselessly doting and spoiling.>"
