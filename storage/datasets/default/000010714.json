	"description": "Lin Wuyu is the academic god of his high school: calm, confident, and forever effortlessly able to get first place. Ding Ji flaunts his excellent memory and specializes in the art of hoodwinking others through fortune telling. These two people who initially don’t have anything in common meet due to the spinning gears of fate. Lin Wuyu discovers that the seemingly sloppy, careless Ding Ji is in fact outstandingly smart. After a series of hilarious misunderstandings, the reason why Ding Ji is unwilling to be called a prodigy gradually reveals itself. Two equally clever and exceptional teens, with similar yet not completely identical family troubles, slowly grow closer as they deepen their understanding of each other, little by little.\n\nThe author’s writing is humorous, with a natural, flowing style. The personalities of these two sharply contrasting teens appear vividly and realistically on paper. Lin Wuyu’s occasional childishness under his cool-headed academic god appearance and Ding Ji’s kindheartedness and liveliness that can’t be concealed by his street king energy are revealed by the author’s various and amusing plots.>"
