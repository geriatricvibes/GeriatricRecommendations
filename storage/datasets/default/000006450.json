	"description": "Wei Yunbai is a young man with face-value that could go against the skies, a quiet and obedient person with first-class acting ability. Unfortunately, he has a mental illness.\n\nThe Child of Destiny: – What does it matter, he’s so good-looking, of course I should love him! Pet him! Bind him to myself!\n\nWei Yunbai smiles softly, “Okay.”\n\nLater, the tall, rude and savage king of the prairie, the heartless gangster who deceives the world, the CEO’s ruthless rival, the death god, who collects souls by peeping through reflections, the emperor sitting on top of the world, who has countless beauties… They all bowed down to him.>"
