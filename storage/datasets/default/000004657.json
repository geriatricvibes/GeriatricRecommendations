	"description": "The maid, Ivnia, who escaped in the night in the midst of a scandal has returned. With a young daughter who looks exactly like the owner of the mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n'The past has already been completely forgotten. Let me work as her maid again.'\r\n\r\n'Did you just run away to do this? '\r\n\r\nIt was the man who told her to erase the child. She was nothing more than a toy. Ivnia bowed her head humiliatingly low without showing any emotion. All she had to do was find materials to cure her child's illness in this mansion. But why is he angry?\r\n\r\n'Give that idiot a job. Or let her live in an abandoned detached house.'\r\n\r\n'Someday you will find me crying again.'>"
