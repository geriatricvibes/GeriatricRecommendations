She wanted to reach the pinnacle of her life by relying on gold fingers, but there seemed to be something wrong?\n\nAfter rebirth, the daily life of the people around her became like this:\n\nFemale Classmate A: Look at that Su Meng, she would cry when even touched. It is really crazy.\n\nFemale Classmate B: Su Meng always has a good smell on her body.\n\nNeighbour C: Su Meng from the house next door looks really good, just like a porcelain doll which can easily break when touched.\n\nNeighbour D: Su Meng is so spoiled, who raised her?\n\nThe big man raised his lips and smiled evilly, “Your father, I, did. What, do you have an opinion?”>"
