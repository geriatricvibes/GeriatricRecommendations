	"description": "Se-eun broke up with Do-won, who was trying to keep their relationship secret while hiding his engagement.\r\nShe meets him, the representative of an important business, five years later.\r\n\r\n“Are you saying you’re no longer the old Jeong Se-eun anymore?”\r\n\r\n“If that’s all you need, I’ll stop…”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think the relationship with Shinhwa Department Store is very important.”\r\n\r\nDowon wants to have her, even if he must utilize every single tool in his arsenal to do so.\r\nSe-eun acknowledges all her regrets and accepts his request.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“No other woman while you're dating me. As you already know, one person at a time, that's my rule. Neither a hidden fiancée nor a wife.”\r\n\r\n“Anything else?”\r\n\r\n“Anytime I want it to end it, that’s the end of the relationship. Also, no one should know about our relationship.”\r\n\r\nDo-won put down the cup he was holding and stood up.\r\n\r\n“Then I have to satisfy my needs as much as possible in a short period of time…”\r\n\r\nHe grabbed Se-eun's arm and slowly pulled her up.\r\n\r\n'Right?'\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head without waiting for an answer. Se-eun closed her eyes tightly as his hard body presses against her firmly; his hot lips covered hers.>"
