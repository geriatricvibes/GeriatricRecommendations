	"description": "While on a school field trip in the Czech Republic, Kang Hyuk happens to stumble into a shop called “Archmage.”\n\n To his disbelief, the shop is actually owned by an archmage… from another world! Forced to become the Archmage’s disciple, Kang Hyuk is punted into the Kallian Continent, where might and magic overwhelm and wyverns fly high in the sky…\n\nIn this world, people are either sword-wielding knights, magic-wielding mages, or spirit-wielding summoners. \n\nThere hasn’t been anyone yet who can do all three… until now.>"
