	"description": "My name is Akira Yano.\n\nI have an average face. My study is so-so. My physical activities are neither good nor bad.\n\nI am an ordinary 17-year-old high school student.\n\nAnd yet… I’m in an empty, blank room right now.\n\nWhere am I? I’m sure I was sleeping at home.\n\nAfter a while, a light suddenly appear and it shines strongly.\n\n“Pow pow pow! Yoo-hoo! It’s the goddess~♪ Congratulations! You’ve been chosen to be summoned as the hero~!”\n\nWhat is it? Is this a gal-like goddess…?\n\nI was suppose to be chosen as a summoned hero by the clumsy goddess, but I was immediately transferred back to my original world due some mixed up on her part . But the “beginner’s pack” blessings that I received were still remained.\n\nHuh? In the other world, it’s a beginner’s pack, but in the modern world, it’s an unbelievable cheat, isn’t it?\n\nIf I use this well, I will be a winner in life, right?>"
