	"description": "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nIn the current world I am a selfish villainess that lived as she liked; in the previous world I lived modestly.\n\nThe result of my self-centered, spoiled lifestyle was to be cheated on by my fiancee, the prince, who after conspiring with his lover, broke off his engagement with me and as the result of a strict trial, my execution was decided. And thankfully as a noble I received an 'honorable' death by guillotine. \n\nAnd so, after I was decapitated by the guillotine, I was reborn into a corpse…\n\n'Reborn”?\n\nNo wait, I don’t even have a head, what are you telling me to do now?>"
