	"description": "I was a princess who lived in the back of the palace, as no one cared about my health.\n\nDamn it.\n\nI felt pain the more I moved and the blood pressure would drop if I expressed excitement.\n\nI was on my deathbed.\n\nUntil one day the Emperor visited me.\n\n“You will die soon.”\n\n“Yes, so … Koh … cough.”\n\nHe had no interest in me.\n\nI had an idea to call him when the blood suddenly came out of my mouth. The emperor left a surprise, and my life began to change since that day.>"
