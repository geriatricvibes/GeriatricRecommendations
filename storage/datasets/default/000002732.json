	"description": "A former young man from Japan is reincarnated as Golan, an ogre in the Demon World.\r\nCurrently, war is erupting all over the Demon World, and it is much like the feudal era. Furthermore, the residents of the Demon World are all of the happy-go-lucky sort.\r\nThese people will take two steps forward if you take half a step back. Modesty is not a virtue in here.\r\nRegardless of what you think, you have to be strong in order to protect your own rights. That’s the Demon World.\r\nBefore he died, his mother told him, ‘you should protect your friends, even if it means risking your own life.’ And while he tries to follow his family’s mantra, problems face him at every corner.\r\n‘I’ll protect all of my family!’ Golan decides, but every day is the dark ages in the Demon World.\r\n>"
