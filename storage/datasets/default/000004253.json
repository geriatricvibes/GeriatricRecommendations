	"description": "Thanks to her lucky parents, Amelia runs a bookstore without worrying about money. \r\nShe opened a bookstore because she is ashamed to buy books under her own name, but she is not ashamed to put it on the list of bookstores. \r\nSo, as she stocks all kinds of books, she unintentionally becomes a famous place for maniacs.\r\n\r\nOne day, while reading her book, Amelia, who was masturbating without knowing it, is caught by her regular customer Edwin?!\r\n\r\n“Without knowing how embarrassing it would be for her virgin, who had never married her, to expose her ass to her unmarried man!” \r\n“No, I mean, who would do that there?” \r\n“Sexuality is human nature! It is unfair!”\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“… Actually, I’m a little bit interested in doing it backwards.” \r\nIt was a harsh expression as if she was revealing her great secret, but it was a true confession of her. Edwin wasn’t too surprised when he was first invited to the room, as it was mentioned in a novel he had seen at first glance. But he couldn’t help the subtle expression on his  face, so Amelia quickly waved her hand. \r\n“Oh, no. It’s literally just interesting. It’s not that I want to do it!” \r\n“I didn’t say anything.”\r\n\r\n>"
