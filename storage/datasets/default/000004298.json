	"description": "Ye Hansheng was disabled in both legs and bad at walking. The rumor was that he was a moody man, and no one dared to hold his shining golden thighs.\n\nWen Run never believed these rumors, every time he saw him from afar, he smiled with curved eyes and was filled with joy.\n\nThen someone else said, “Look at that Wen Run, he even risked his life to climb the bed, and Ye Hansheng, the god of evil, dared to mess with him.\n\nWen Run tried to explain every time: Ye Hansheng is not like that, he is a good man.\n\nYe Hansheng happened to hear, and decided to show the little sheep what a bad guy was.\n\nThe little sheep was trembling with fear and shyness, but not fear and disgust, he was simply unbelievably good and soft.\n\nYe Hansheng’s heart suddenly softened, thinking that it was not difficult to be a good person.\n\nLater, they found out that the little transparent Wen Run really held the golden thigh. All the way, the resources kept gathering a line of traffic like a rocket.\n\nAnd Ye Hansheng was also really a good person. But…he was only good to Wen Run.>"
