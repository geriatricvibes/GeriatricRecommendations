	"description": "Because of her sudden appearance, the story line of the whole book has been messed up… In order to leave Nan’s home, Luan Xiaotian used thousands of tactics, climbing walls, fighting c*ck and catching shrimps, attacking Mr. Nan with bad words, and even auctioning Mr. Nan as a commodity. Falling… But Mr. Nan was not moved at all. He would teach her to play the piano, sing to her, and give her many colorful sweets. Everyone knows that there is a savage and willful wild girl in Mr. Nan’s family who does all kinds of evil and does all kinds of embarrassing things. But someone said bad things about her… Mr. Nan immediately coldly said: “Her willfulness is what I am used to.”>"
