	"description": "Crossed over to ancient times after a betrayal. \n\nThe emperor humiliates her, the concubines bully her. The queen doesn’t mind! She was more at ease outside the palace! \n\nTurning the county mansion into a queen’s hotel, a palace maid into a waitress and guards into respected bodyguards… At night, she counts her silver and laughs out loud as beautiful men are sent to her door to serve enthusiastically. So satisfying!>"
