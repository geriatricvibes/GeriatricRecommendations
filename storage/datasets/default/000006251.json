	"description": "The Wanderers came to this world from another, from Japan. However, due to global disasters caused by the reckless behavior of Wanderers in the past, the Executioner must kill them as soon as they’re found.\n\nOne day, the Executioner, Menou, meets a lost girl, Akari. Menou carries out her mission calmly and without hesitation. However, for some reason, Akari, whom she surely killed, resurrects without a care in the world. At a loss, Menou tricks the immortal Akari into coming along on a journey to find a way to kill her, but…\n\n“Menou. Let’s go!”\n\n”Yes yes yes. I understand.”\n\nMenou‘s mind begins to waver a little as she faces the strangely relaxed Akari.\n\n— this is the story of how she’s going to kill her.>"
