	"description": "One day, the engagement between the Second Prince Arnight and his fiancee, Veena Lilyfall, was broken off.\n\nHowever, despite it being the cause of the disengagement, she has no memories of ever bullying that girl.\n\nNo matter how groundless the accusations were, when Lady Lilyfall’s fall from grace was announced to the public, the wolves in the hall with their cold glares began to see her as easy prey. Only the Princess, younger sibling to Prince Arnight, didn’t seem to fully understand the situation.\n\nThe Princess sought to protect Veena, and together they escaped.>"
