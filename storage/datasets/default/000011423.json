I couldn't believe that I was going to mix up hair ornaments and rumor,\r\n\r\n'I thought if I stayed here, I would be able to meet you, Natsume-kun.'\r\n\r\nBut then, I met my first love again, Hirose Haru, who had moved to Tokyo for college!?\r\n\r\nJust like in the old days, we played together, she helped me with my studies---It was the time when my longtime unrequited love was rewarded.\r\n\r\n'Sometimes, you look like Seitarou-senpai'.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't just my unrequited love that started to move.\r\n\r\nHaru-senpai's unrequited love for my deceased brother also started to move.>"
