	"description": "Tehez married the prince she had a crush on.\r\n\r\nBut in this marriage, only duties and responsibilities remain.\r\n\r\n“I can’t sleep. Isn’t that the same for my wife?”\r\n\r\n“…”\r\n\r\n“So the wife has to help her husband fall asleep. Is not it?”\r\n\r\nHe arrives late at night like an uninvited guest and leaves before dawn.\r\n\r\nThe two still have no children.\r\n\r\n“You are under pressure every day to have an heir. My wife must have gone out and met another b*stard, yes?”\r\n\r\n“You are misunderstood. Prince.”\r\n\r\n“Stop it! Tehez.”\r\n\r\nDisdainful eyes.\r\n\r\nYou misunderstood me, and I didn’t deceive you.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, you and I will live on parallel lines that will never meet.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYou were my duty and my responsibility.\r\n\r\nI want to end our story.>"
