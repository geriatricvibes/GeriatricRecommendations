	"description": "Rumors circulated that he only cared about money, had blighted affairs with his adulterous sponsors, and abandoned his fellow group members he had known for two-years after renegotiating a contract with a major entertainment agency.\r\n\r\nHe had taken possession of the body of a hopeless idol whose common moniker was 'Beautiful Scum'.\r\n\r\nHe thought he got blatantly ripped-off by signing that contract.\r\n\r\nEverything aforementioned had been far from his actual self. He was a sob-story right out of a melodrama; not even close to being 'scum'.\r\n\r\nThis was the tale of how he, enraged by the body of the previous possessor's shitty life, personally took revenge for him.\r\n\r\nSo far, everything had gone accordingly. However, in the process, he gradually tamed the people around him.\r\n\r\nHe posed/masqueraded/feigned his pessimism as optimism.\r\n\r\nSometimes he appeared stoic, and other times cordial,\r\nWhilst simultaneously acting innocent.\r\nHe was the sole person unaware of the harem that, little by little, began to encompass him.>"
