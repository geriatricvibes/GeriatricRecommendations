	"description": "A no-name writer becomes the personal assistant to a famous web novelist, and moves in with him amidst much bickering. He freeloads off the successful novelist, eats the novelist’s food, lives in the novelist’s house, and, eventually, even sleeps in the novelist’s bed.\r\n\r\nA certain no-name writer (flipping a table): 'It was totally that bastard who forced me to---Mmph! Mmph! Mmph! Oi, Su Yuyang, why're you covering my mouth?'\r\n\r\nThe successful novelist (whispering into the no-name writer’s ear): 'Xiao Miao, I’m hungry.'\r\n\r\nEnjoy the simple pleasures of the everyday with an oddball novelist and his dumb cat.>"
