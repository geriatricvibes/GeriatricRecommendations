	"description": "Every female employee in the company wanted to be Mrs. Zhou. They were all thinking about how fine Zhou Yi’s body was under his fitted suit.\n\nOnly Su Nanxing accidentally had a one night stand with him.\n\nShe wanted to say: Boss Zhou is even more powerful than what you think after the lights are turned off.\n\nHowever, Zhou Yi was no longer the aloof Boss Zhou after this one accidental night. Instead, he became an insatiable beast.\n\nSu Nanxing noticed that Zhou Yi was looking for all kinds of excuses to cling to her.\n\nShe was fed up and asked, “Can you let me go?”\n\nZhou Yi said, “You are too delicious. How can I let you go?”\n\nLater, Su Nanxing realized that he was a man who bought beautiful red clothes when he saw it and he liked buying her red lace underwear, red bikinis, and red dresses.\n\nBut what he enjoyed the most was Su Nanxing wearing each of these pieces for him to see.\n\nShe was like a present tied up with a red ribbon, waiting for him to unwrap her. >"
