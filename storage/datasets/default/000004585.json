	"description": "She is an ex-wife who is killed by the male lead of a R-19 novel.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t even do anything because when I woke up here, my wedding vows were already over.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what my husband does, but he often comes back covered in blood.\r\n\r\nI learnt how to heal the wound with magic.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original, I was close with my husband’s beautiful sister.\r\n\r\nI have always been nice to my husband’s stepson.\r\n\r\n…… Far from getting a safe divorce, it seems like I got caught in a trap.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been working so hard on social activities, so it seems like you have caught an eye with another bastard?”\r\n\r\nI confessed that I had an unrequited love that I didn’t even have.\r\n\r\nMy husband’s reaction, which has always been cold, is unusual.>"
