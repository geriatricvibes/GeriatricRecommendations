	"description": "From a stumbling lion cub to a majestic lion king, he imagines that his life as a lion would peak and end with him owning a vast territory, dominating the grasslands, terrifying all his enemies while having many wives and concubines. \r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, his life as a lion has just begun. \r\n\r\nThe Earth's energy has mutated; all kinds of mutated creatures are attacking, and humans have fallen from the top of the food chain, and the African grasslands fall into a crisis. \r\n\r\nAnd he, too, is gradually becoming stronger through evolution and mutation.>"
