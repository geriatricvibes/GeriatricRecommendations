	"description": "A man-hater named Sapphire married a super ‘friendly’ guy named Johann for the sake of getting her inheritance. The two of them get along. She exempted him from her wrath against men. This is because they are ‘Friends’. Until almost every day he was always topless inside their house. She also noticed that he was ‘flirting’ with her. But he only said, “I’m not flirting with you. No malice, please. We’re friends.”>"
