	"description": "I was a normal high schooler, until one day, I was suddenly summoned to another world. Moreover, only my soul was summoned, so I used a doll as my body and ended up living as a witch’s familiar. Not only that, the witch girl who summoned me was an incompetent, s*upid girl, who had no capability as a magician. And what made it worse, she was a fugitive on the run!\n\nHowever, in this unknown world, I can only rely on this girl, and for some reason, I decided to venture this world with this tremendous magical power I had somehow as my weapon.\n\nBy meeting with various people and solving incidents we encountered, I learned more about this world.\n\nThis is the story of a s*upid witch girl and me traveling in this cruel but also kind world.>"
