	"description": "In the strange and curious world lives thousands of species of demon beasts. Here, you do not have your regular dogs and cats as pets. Instead, wild demon beasts are caught from the forest right next to the city and tamed as pets! With the help of a fake system and an advanced spaceship, Cao Yan has to survive and grow in this new world—a different kind of civilization, with a different set of technology—as a Demon Pet Trainer.>"
