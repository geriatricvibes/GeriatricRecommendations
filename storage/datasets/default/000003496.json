	"description": "She possessed Charlotte Lania, an extra character that was not even mentioned much in the original. \n\nShe thought the bloody socialite world and politics were only stories from another world. That was until she accidentally met the male lead’s younger brother and saved him.\n\nTheodore Heinst.\n\nThe younger brother of the male lead, who was supposed to die at the age of three.\n\nIf I didn’t save him, I could be accused of an assassination attempt and accomplice to a crime.\n\nIn the end, Charlotte decided to take good care of the child and clear her name. \n\nHowever…\n\n“Theo wants to live with you!”\n\nThe little kid started to refuse to go back home and yet,\n\n“Can you be the Lady of the Heinst House?”\n\nCarlisle (Carcel) Heinst, the male lead, who was supposed to marry the original female lead, proposed to Charlotte a contract marriage.\n\nGoodbye, extra character’s peaceful life.>"
