She is also my childhood friend whom I have not seen in several years.\r\n\r\nHowever, this seemingly perfect Kurokawa has a 'certain' secret...\r\n\r\n'Tak-kun, you're here! There's probably something in there.'\r\n\r\nIn fact, she is so timid that she cannot go to the bathroom alone at night!\r\n\r\nWhen Kurokawa's parents were transferred overseas, I decided to live with her and help her overcome her weakness.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid of ...... being alone, so why don't you sleep with me?'\r\n\r\nI'm afraid of being alone, so I'm going to sleep with you.\r\n\r\n'Hey, are you okay with my high school life!?'>"
