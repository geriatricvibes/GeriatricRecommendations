	"description": "“I want to be like you.”\n\nSolon, who has been exiled by his comrades, met the secluded and lonely princess, Philia.\n\n“I had met you once,” she said. She always believed his words that as long you got magic knowledge, you could be free.\n\nWith the request of his former instructor, Solon became an instructor for that girl. To protect the girl from assassins, they were sleeping together inside a room with a barrier.\n\nThey went everywhere together. From choosing magic staffs to fighting ghosts. With that, Philia’s training as a magician has started, but it looked like the main figure of the empire’s schemes was starting to move... \n\nA magic swordsman who was despised because of his versatility and more so, his inferior skills, met with the uncommon princess.>"
