	"description": "Lu Xing zhi's 18th birthday gift was a handsome, wealthy fiance. Since then, the little lonely orphan girl turned directly into Ms. Rich Perfect and embarked on the pinnacle of her life.\n\nAfter getting over a scumbag, she was drowning in a pampered happy life.\n\nShe merely wanted to hold tightly onto this golden thigh, instead of being left gnawed to the bone by that scumbag.\n\nHuo Jinchen: 'It's my first time. Don't let me down.'\n\nLu Xingzhi: 'Old man, don't be so shameless.'\n\nHuo Jinchen: 'This old man loves you dearly. Good girl, let your husband love you dearly.'\n\nHuo Jinchen in the eyes of other: honorable and elegant, clean-living and honest, and a modest gentleman.\n\nIn the eyes of Lu Xingzhi: A black bellied old man.\n\n'All right, I'll give you all you want, but you must never leave me.'\n\nLu Xingzhi nodded resolutely. This uncle has the money, the looks, a ravishing figure, and was so good to her. She would never leave unless she has a hole in her brain.\n\n'What are you doing with your clothes off?'\n\n'Seduce you.'\n\nLove her and love her deeply. It's an essential homework for Huo Jinchen with Lu Xingzhi.>"
