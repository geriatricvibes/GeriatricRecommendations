	"description": "A fickle, decadent, wilful person going through life like it’s a game.\r\n\r\nAn experienced, logical mind that’s above feelings.\r\n\r\nThis was a relationship that had started off with “Carpe Diem”, but slowly turned into a bloodless, psychological battle. They shared a mutual distrust, but also mutual attraction. As they suspected and tested each other, challenging each other’s limits, they both fell into the enemy’s hands with their eyes wide open. Sentiments growing amidst ignorance, they finally, were caught in their own traps.\r\n\r\nWinner takes all,\r\n\r\nLoser stands small.>"
