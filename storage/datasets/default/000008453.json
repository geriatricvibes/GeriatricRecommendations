	"description": "Renier of Elde Isle, thou who art loved by Inanna.\r\n\r\nThy possess a fragrance that will allure many men.\r\n\r\nI see two men who shalt love thee.\r\n\r\n“Never forget. You offered your life to me, and you vowed to be mine. You may not dispose of your life without my permission because it belongs to me.”\r\n\r\nAnd I see two men whom thou shalt love.\r\n\r\n“There’s something I want to tell you no matter what once I’ve done everything I have to do. I’ll protect you. From everyone who ever tries to hurt you……. And from every god who ever tries to hurt you too.”\r\n\r\nBut the blessing became a curse, and the choice became as chains.\r\n\r\nRenier decided that she would no longer allow it to hold sway over her.\r\n\r\nAnd above all else,\r\n\r\nShe resolved herself to never love another and thereby transfer her curse onto them.>"
