	"description": "My sister from a different mother was blessed with beauty, education, psionic ability… She had everything.\r\n\r\nI on the other hand, other than having the same blood flowing through our veins, was just a servant. My appearance was shabby, I had no education nor did I inherit any psionic abilities. I was an unloved, unwanted daughter.\r\n\r\nEven the only one who was on my side, my childhood friend, married my half-sister and inherited my father’s business. I was seen as a hindrance and was kicked out of the house to be wedded to another.\r\n\r\nTo a man rumoured to be frightening and ruthless.\r\n\r\nAs that may be, this is a story about a heroine who met a loving husband and went on to lead a blissful life.>"
