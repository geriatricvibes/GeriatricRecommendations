	"description": "This is the story of a superstar reborn as a small wallflower in the entertainment world.\n\nFour years after his death, Jing Anjue has been reborn in the body of an obscure idol. As Shan Yatong, he embarks on his journey again, striving to reconquer what was once his domain — the entertainment circle.\n\nAlong the way, the new Shan Yatong catches the eyes of quite a few people within the industry. This includes: the current reigning Superstar, a fellow popular young idol, and a CEO who has history with the previous Jing Anjue. But everyone will find it is not so easy to win his heart, as Shan Yatong is now a trailblazer with a heart of ice.>"
