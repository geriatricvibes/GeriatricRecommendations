	"description": "Acknowledge moving to Eden magical sealing process, please connect the 'Sophia code,” a girl was asked to erect the barrier, and on her cheeks there slid tears.\n\n“Shelltis... will we be able to meet again?” \n\nA world where humans are ruled by an existence called Yuugenshu. And only by The Priestess' prayer, the floating continent, “Obia Craire,” was the only place where humans could live.\n\nYumi, the barrier priestess, was waiting for a boy that would protect her, her childhood friend, Shelltis. As a heretic, he was expelled from the continent, but before he was expelled he promised Yumi that he'd definitely return to her side.\n\nA girl who is personified by understanding the world and a boy who is rejected by it. A story of two conflicting feelings, and a multi-layered world fantasy.>"
