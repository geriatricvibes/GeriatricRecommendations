	"description": "The beast who controlled the Empire’s commerce, Idylos Roxen, Duke of Cadellarot. It was an open fact that he hated animals extremely. However, it was the Duke’s sister who picked me up, a kitten, and I was caught while hiding.\n\nIn order to live comfortably, I must somehow capture his heart. So I followed his tail every day and acted cute…\n\n“Eww..!”\n\n‘Eww?’\nIdylos hastily covered my mouth. I stiffened in embarrassment…\n\n‘Did he just almost yelled at me?’\nIt was only then that I realized. This man didn’t hate me, he was scared of me!\n\nIdylos said, while he tightly clasped my hand with his,”You said you wanted to eat me.”\n\n“What are you talking about? It’s all a joke…” I said.\n\n“Joke? Are you serious!? At that time, I was so scared that I couldn’t sleep…”\nThere was a faint resentment in his dark eyes looking down at me. I knew I shouldn’t be fooled by those pitiful eyes.\n\nIn time, his expression changed as I expected and he daringly laughed at me like a beast cornering its prey.\n\n“Take responsibility.”\n\n“…”\n\n“If it’s you, I’ll eat you up.”\n\n…I was just trying, making an effort not to be hated. This man completely forgotten his fear.>"
