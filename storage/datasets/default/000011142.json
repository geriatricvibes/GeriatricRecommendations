	"description": "Kanata Kurosaki is a high school student living a simple school life.\n\nOne rainy day, Kanata catches a cold and collapses on his way home from his part-time job.\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\nThe person who saves him is Shion Yumekawa, a beautiful girl who is called the “Sleeping Princess” because she sleeps all the time at school.\n\n“I’m so excited to have a friend to sleep with!”\n\n“Since when did you and I become… friends?”\n\nMy relationship with her was only supposed to last for that one night.\n\n“Will you be my sleeping friend?”\n\n“What the hell is a sleeping friend?”\n\n“Well, it’s a friend who sleeps with you.”\n\n“…Sure?”\n\nSince then, Kanata and Shion have been sleeping together regularly.\n\n“Breakfast will be ready soon, so be patient.”\n\n“Would you like to have a study session with me?”\n\n“It’s like a date, just the two of us going out together…”\n\nHuh? I thought you said our relationship was only about snuggling.\n\nThis is a romantic comedy about a lonely, gloomy protagonist who becomes involved in a lovey-dovey relationship with a silver-haired, respectful-tongued, caring, clumsy beautiful girl while sleeping together (without realizing it).>"
