	"description": "On his way to work, Shimizu, a systems engineer, faints at a train station because of his strenuous job. As everyone pretends not to see him, the only person to call out to him is his elementary school classmate, Suzuki. But when Shimizu wakes up for the second time, he discovers that he has been imprisoned in a strange place and has been undressed and violated by Suzuki, who he expected to be humane! \n\n“Looks like you get more excited when you’re tortured.” \n\nInside this cell, day by day he drowns in sex…his nipples and asshole are toyed with; his body – molded into something corrupt. Shame turning to pleasure.>"
