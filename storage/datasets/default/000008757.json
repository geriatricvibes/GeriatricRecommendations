	"description": "'Alicia, I am breaking my engagement with you!'\n\nWith those words, she realized she had reincarnated as Alicia, the Villainess of the Otome Game 'Magical Rhapsody.'\n\nMore so, this realization came just after her engagement was broken. But that doesn't matter.\n\nBecause the character that she loved through the screen is now in front of her.\n\nIt's not the beautiful platinum blonde, Reynes, the First Prince of the Borg Kingdom... but it's the main character, Melia, who's standing behind him?!\n\nIt seems the Villainess whose engagement was broken offers her overflowing love to the Heroine while the Capture Targets help or hinder her.>"
