	"description": "Qing Yun was probably the only villain who had suffered this much.\n\nFor hundreds of years, a protagonist had always been barking at him and attempting to harm him, but just couldn’t kill him.\n\nWhen he spent his days bedridden like a dying man, his life was no better than that of the dead.\n\nPeople respected him, feared him, secretly cursed at him, but he just wouldn’t die!\n\nBut he, the ultimate BOSS, has become an insignificant cannon fodder only to be manipulated and destroyed?\n\nThat’ll never happen.\n\nA certain green-eyed man: Cutie, come into my arms.\n\nQing Yun: Heh heh, Lao Zi will teach you how to behave.\n\n*Ding* the world’s most ferocious little cutie has come online~>"
