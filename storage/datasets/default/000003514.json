	"description": "Omega Haewon, who is forced to hide her character and live as an alpha.\n\nAlpha Adam, posing as Omega for revenge.\n\nThe two meet as partners of a political marriage with a secret inside.\n\n“You don’t like me?”\n\n“What you’re thinking right now. I can do it all for you.”\n\nWas the voice of a snake seducing the first woman like this?\n\n***\n\n“What can I do to stop doing this?”\n\n“You’re wrong, Haewon. You don’t want to tame me, but you want to first put a leash on me.”\n\n“You’re not the type to stay still even if I fill you up.”\n\n“Huh? Do I look like that?”\n\nAdam smiled and asked back.\n\n“But you keep avoiding me.”\n\nSo she thought he would attack her.\n\n“Please be kind to me. Then I’ll listen to you.”\n\nAdam, who straightened his head, bent his eyes and smiled.\n\n“Huh? Haewon.”\n\nAdam’s eyes as he put Haewon’s name in his mouth\n\nHe was filled with joy as if he were a man possessed by a passionate dream.\n\nLike an alpha who met his destined mate.>"
