	"description": "One day, young Emiliette, who was bullied by her servants, suddenly recalls memories of her past life. \n\nShe had been reincarnated into a book she had read in her previous life, as a child of the main characters. Three years after the ending of the novel, her mother died while giving birth to Emiliette, leaving her father unattended with only his daughter left.\n\n‘I can’t keep living like this!’\n\nAfter the news of my father’s return came out, I decided to change the situation, but…\n\n“Why is that thing in front of my eyes?”\n- The first meeting I was looking forward to, ends with only a cold glare.\n’…but I can’t give up!’\n\n1. Frequent encounters.\n“Hewwo Papa! Papa, where are you gwoing?”\n\n2. Attacking with presents.\n“Papa~ I’ll give you this. It’s a gift. Let’s be close friends from now on. I’ll come every day!”\n\n3. Compliments!\n“Ah! It’s so bright~ I can’t get close to Papa because he’s shining.”\n\nBut something’s wrong.\nEven though he replies to everything I ask, his answers are…\n\n“The office.”\n“You’ve brought something useless again.”\n- Yet you kept the useless thing.\n“…shut up.”\n\nHe’s especially shy about compliments. Does he really hate me?>"
