	"description": "One day, when I opened my eyes, I had become Rosé, the second daughter of a wealthy family. What do you mean I’m a lady of leisure born with a golden spoon in my mouth? I won’t let this chance of a lifetime slip through my fingers. I’m going to loaf around and enjoy good food.\n\n“I’ll do my best as a fiancé, Rosé,” said a rich man with world-class good looks.\n\nAt this point, it was impossible to deny it. This is a Korean fantasy romance. I must have become a character in a romance fantasy!\n\n***\n\nThis is the story of a girl who transmigrated into what she thought was a romance fantasy book, but…\n\nIt’s actually a horror story!>"
