	"description": "Before taking his final breath, Xia Yu had a dream of eating until he threw up. When he awoke, he arrived at a completely foreign world—the world of Shokugeki no Soma.\r\n\r\nWhat is this? Cultivating the God of Cooking?\r\n\r\n“What you must satisfy is not only the desire of normal humans, but also the desire of all sorts of demons and monsters, ghosts and spirits! You must use food to rehabilitate them!” the old man said to him in a rather cool manner.\r\n\r\nThus, Xia Yu never got a chance to rest on his road to become a God of Cooking.>"
