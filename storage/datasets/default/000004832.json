When he came home from school one day he found his elder sister being violated by his stepfather. He saved her despite it being a  dangerous situation.\n\nHitomi’s attitude completely changed afterwards. Obsessed by Nozomu (as one of the opposite sex), she started to remove any woman who approached him one after another.\n\nAs Nozomu tried to regain the everyday happiness he had from the days with his deceased father, Hitomi’s abnormal affection continued to escalate.>"
