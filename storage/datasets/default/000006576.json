	"description": "In the Country of Fine Cuisine, chefs are the most respected vocation.\n\nLuo Xiu, an award-winning chef from planet Earth, crossed over into this world by accident.  With a Mapo bean curd in his hand, the dish created a strange vision of  Flaming Mountain.\n\nFood that caused clothes to explode? Food that glows? Food that creates visions? Food that causes illusion?\n\nThat’s right, a Xiuzhen chef on this continent can produce these special effects when they cook.\n\nHave you seen potatoes as big as a human head?\n\nHave you seen jade colored wheat?\n\nWhat about chickens that are 0.8m tall?\n\nIn this world, these are just the most basic ingredients.\n\n“Well, these ingredients are interesting and are a good fit for Chinese Cuisine!”\n\n“If you move again, I will release the dish- Buddha Jumps over the wall!”\n\nBoom!\n\nA large golden Buddha sat on 10 Xiuzhen practitioners and squashed them to death!>"
