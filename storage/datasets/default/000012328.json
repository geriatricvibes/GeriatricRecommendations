	"description": "Taoist master Tang Xi transmigrated into a dog-blood cliche novel with a real-fake daughter trope and became the villainess Tang Xi – the real daughter who found her family after sixteen years. In the novel, Tang Xi hated the female protagonist, Tang Jing, for taking her place. She fell in love with the male lead and used vicious means to destroy Tang Jing. In the end, like all villainess, she got her bad ending.\n\nHeavenly master Tang after recalling the plot: The world of the rich is too bloody and sinister, it’s better to stay away from so-called family and start her own business. \n\nBut if anyone come looking for abuse, she would not mind showing them her unique way of dealing with scums: Lock the doors and let the ghosts out!>"
