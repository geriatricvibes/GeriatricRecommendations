	"description": "Musker, the fiancé of the Marchioness Amelia, puts his childhood friend in the priority. \r\n\r\nHe proudly tells her that she is frail and he must help her. \r\n\r\nAmelia is worried about her upcoming wedding.\r\n\r\nMusker answers his childhood friend's calls during all the important wedding conversations, including choosing the rings and the dress. \r\n\r\nAmelia has finally given up on marrying him after seeing him like this. \r\n\r\nHowever, when she asks Musker's father to formally break the engagement, he makes her wait and asks for more time. \r\n\r\nMusker's brother Aaron, who had studied abroad for years, returned a month later and assured Amelia, 'I swear I will make you happy. Please marry me.' \r\n\r\nAmelia can only nod her head in perplexity at the confession of Aaron, whom she has long loved but given up on since he had another woman in his life.\r\n>"
