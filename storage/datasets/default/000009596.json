	"description": "The simulation theory―― a theory that claims the world is a simulation program running on a computer.\r\n\r\nWhen Kageyama, an engineer, was called by the owner of the computer running the simulation that is our world, and asked if he was willing to reduce the human population by more than half, the choice seemed obvious.\r\n\r\nBut that was before he realized a much harsher fate would be waiting for mankind if he refused.>"
