If not for being rescued by his teacher, the infamous Crazy, Mighty Martial Artist Sinto Gendeng, Wiro would have met the same fate as his parents. \n\nTaken as a disciple by Sinto Gendeng, Wiro became a formidable martial artist with his weapon Deadly Fire Dragon Hatchet 212 and was imprinted a tattoo “212” on his chest. \n\nWith his supreme skills taught by Sinto Gendeng, and accompanied by his formidable Hatchet, Wiro roamed the lands and seas of Indonesia and beyond, taking down criminals and evil martial artists and fulfilling his blood vengeance, acting funny and crazy while he was at it!>"
