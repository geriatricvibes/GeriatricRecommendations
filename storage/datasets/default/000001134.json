	"description": "Bai Qi was going through the unluckiest period of time in his entire life.  \n\nHis boyfriend married another person. \n\nHis boyfriend’s older brother came to him with a cheque book in hand. “I’ll give you fifty million…”\n\nAlright, I understand. I should take this fifty million and leave your younger brother alone, am I right? \n\n“I want to hire you to act as my companion for some time,” the older brother said.\n\n“Huh???” Bai Qi asked. \n\n“No kidding, I can be all things. All from a cute and pure white lotus to a flirtatious and calculative minx! I can even fake a pregnancy, an abortion, a break up and get into a quarrel with you! Please dear sir, do tell, which type would you require me to be?”>"
