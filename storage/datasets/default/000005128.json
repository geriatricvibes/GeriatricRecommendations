Jing Man woke up and found six eggs on his bed.\n\nThe sizes and patterns were different, exquisite and beautiful; a soft, child-like voice called him father.\n\nThen, a nobleman with a stern expression knocked on the door and said he accidentally left his son at his home.\n\nJing Man snickered and petted the golden retriever…\n\nWho was this wild man? Don’t try to steal my baby!>"
