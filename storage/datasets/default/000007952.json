	"description": "A weak little straight boy goes to the same college and lives in the same dorm with his two roommates from high school. Seeing his two brothers getting more intimate every day, this little straight boy tries to blend in, offering many times to help. And, guess what? His two roommates were in love with each other since the very beginning!\n\n“Gosh! How stupid am I to not even notice that?”\n\n“How many times have I made fool of myself by trying to be a kind roommate?”\n\n“Alas! Being a great and straight roommate is indeed difficult.”\n\n“But, what have I done wrong?”\n\n“Oh! Great! I’m a gay now.”>"
