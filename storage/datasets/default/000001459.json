	"description": "“It’s because of you. You should have died.”\r\n\r\nEven though I married Terio Alte, my childhood sweetheart, I had to live an unhappy life.\r\n\r\nIt all started because of the Marquis Annecy Bethelgius.\r\n\r\nMy sister, who had engaged in political affairs with him, also died. Then, I found out that my husband, Terio, loved my sister and resented me for her death. So I gave up my life because I couldn’t endure that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I came back at the time before I married Terio.\r\n\r\nBut, what will change?\r\n\r\nUnbelieving a happy ending, I married Annecy Bethelgius instead of my sister.\r\n\r\nI expected to live a loveless marriage and not the loving marriage that I’ve wanted all my whole life.\r\n\r\nSo why is Annecy putting on a mask and pretending to be an affectionate couple?\r\n\r\n“I hope your friendly mask lasts a long time, until the day you take my life.”>"
