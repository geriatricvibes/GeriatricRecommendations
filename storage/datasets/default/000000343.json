	"description": "I am the Demon King… or was, in my previous life. Now, I’m a human noble girl known as Rosewood Angelique. My fiance, Heath, has been indifferent to me lately. Just as I was thinking about why this would be, I recovered fragments of my previous life’s memories and the memories of the life before that as well, that had helped me in the previous life.\n\nThis is a romance story from my previous world, and I’ve been reincarnated as the noble girl villainess in the story.>"
