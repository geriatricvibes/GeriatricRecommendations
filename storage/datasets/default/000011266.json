	"description": "[Hero of Knights]\n\nI transmigrated into the mobile game that I was holding until my death.\n\nIt happened to be a ‘female-oriented’ card game!\n\nYeohwan, who became the main character in the game, struggled to set up the strongest handsome knights…\n\n“Were you unable to sleep because of the issue of naming the mercenary corps? Any name given by Commander is fine.”\n\n“Naming the mercenary corps…?”\n\n“You were supposed to tell me this morning. Of course, I didn’t wake you up because of that.”\n\nThe voice mixed with laughter echoed in his ears, and the system window he had been waiting for appeared in front of Yeohwan, who had a s*upid expression on his face.\n\n[Please name the mercenaries.]\n[When completed, the game will begin in full.]\nAh… How am I supposed to build a knight order with one B-grade card?>"
