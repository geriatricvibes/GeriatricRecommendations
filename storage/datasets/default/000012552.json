	"description": "On the Eighteenth, because of my father’s remonstrance against the tyrant, my head was cut off on the decapitation table along with the rest of my family’s.\n\nAnd then I woke up again, on my twelfth birthday.\n\nI decided to become the tyrant’s scheming vassal to make the most of my family’s position.\n\nSo, Your Majesty, let us get to know each other better.\n\nI will be sincerely good to you. Please don’t kill me again!\n\n“Your Highness, I’m really on your side. I swear!”\n\n“Shut up!”\n\nHowever, this promising tyrant, who was distrustful of humanity, became more and more lenient.\n\n“Your Highness, don’t let me deceive you.”\n\n“It’s the only way you’ll stay close to me, so do it.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’m warning you again, I care about what’s mine, so don’t harm your body without my permission.”>"
