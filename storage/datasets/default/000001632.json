	"description": "I am a doctor, and after I became a zombie, I found that my face was paralyzed.\n\nActually, I didn’t want to block the zombies for my patient, but I accidentally stumbled and fell on him.\n\nAs for why I am conscious, it may be because I am handsome…\n\nAfter all, compared to those A zombie that stinks and dries and still grows green hair, except that my skin is paler, my body temperature is a little lower, my pupils are a little discolored, and there are a few cyan veins on my neck, as long as I don’t say…\n\nActually I can still see that I am not a normal person.\n\nI was able to determine that my stomach was not interested in humans.\n\nHowever, my patient seems to smell delicious…\n\nRong Yun (smile): Be good, don’t bite anyone\n\nXiao Shenwei (face paralysis and rub hands): Okay, ah hoo~>"
