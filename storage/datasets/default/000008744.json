	"description": "Cen Ning was taken to the residential compound at the age of thirteen. The kids in the compound saw that she was non-threatening and timid, so they bullied her fervently.\n\nCen Ning was filled with panic, so she could only build up her courage to run towards Yan Xingzhi:\n\nI heard that I’m your wife, can you back me up?\n\n…\n\nAfter growing up, Cen Ning left because other people said that Yan Xingzhi already had someone else he liked.\n\nCen Ning was a little sad, but she still went to greet him before leaving:\n\nI heard that I won’t be your wife anymore, so can I like other people now?\n\nHow time flies.\n\nYan Xingzhi pressed down against the little white rabbit in front of him, all his emotions transforming into a faint smile, have I backed you up in vain for all these years?>"
