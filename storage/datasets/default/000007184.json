	"description": "Shota Mukawa, an ordinary boy with no special characteristics, was broken by the shock of being betrayed by the four girls he trusted. Heartbroken, he moved to the countryside and worked on himself while healing his emotional wounds.\n\nOne day, his mother remarried and he became Shota Nijitani, returning to the place where he was born and raised. At the high school he transferred to, there were girls called the “Four Colored Goddesses”. These goddesses are the demons who betrayed Shota and threw him into hell.\n\nShota was shaken by the trauma of his past, but the goddesses didn’t recognize Shota Nijitani as Shota Mukawa because he had changed his appearance and last name.\n\nHe takes this as an opportunity to keep his distance and try to live his life, but somehow the relationship grows deeper.\n\nGradually, the truth of what happened in the past begins to emerge.……>"
