	"description": "When he, Reiji Bulgunk was a child, his home village was attacked by hordes of monsters.\r\n\r\nThe one who rescued him and fought off the monsters was S-rank adventurer [Ice Princess] Alisa Veloce.\r\n\r\nReiji admired the heroic figure dancing on the battlefield, and fell in love with her.\r\n\r\nTen years later. Reiji has become an adventurer in pursuit of her, and Alisa has retired from active service and become a guild receptionist.\r\n\r\n“Is there a quest that can capture you?”\r\n\r\n“How about, say, defeating an orc in heat?　I’m sure you’ll be welcomed with open arms.”\r\n\r\n“I fell in love with you at first sight back then, Alisa-san. Please go out with me!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nThe two, whose positions had changed drastically, started their day with the usual exchange at the guild today.>"
