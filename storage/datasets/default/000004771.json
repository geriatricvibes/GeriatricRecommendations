	"description": "When I was young, I was possessed as an extra villain and married the male lead, who eventually killed me.\n\nTo avoid the death flag, I tried not to get involved with him.\n\n“Hey, why is it so cold in here?”\n\nI changed my mind when I saw a very poor duke who had no money to lose.\n\nEither way, I have to wait five years before I can divorce him.\n\nIn the meantime, let’s save the family, raise the male lead well, and get a divorce from the alimony!\n\n“Is there anything you want?”\n\n“Anything I want?”\n\n“Yes! Anything!”\n\n“Then can you buy me a sister?”\n\n“What? Me?”\n\nBut my little husband was so gentle that he felt lovely and cute.\n\nBut my divine beast warned me that there was something…\n\n[Master, that kid is dangerous.]\n“It’s alright, Blackie.”\n[What if you regret it later?]\nMaybe it was my stubbornness…\n\n‘It’s because I have to protect you.’\n\nI wanted to believe in the boy who only looked at me.>"
