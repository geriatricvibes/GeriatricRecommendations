	"description": "Chi Yuyang transmigrated into another world in ancient times.\n\nThe first creature she encountered was a wounded tiger cub.\n\nAs a cat lover, Chi Yuyang looked at the hairball in front of her and helped it.\n\nBut no one told her that the cub was an extremely powerful beastman.\n\nBefore transformation:\n\nHairball: Awoooo (you’re not allowed to touch me).\nThe cute Chi Yuyang: Tuan Tuan is so cute.\n\nAfter transformation:\n\nHu Jin: Aowu aowuu (wife touch me).\nChi Yuyang who was thrown down: Get off of me.\n\nAs the only adult beastman in the tiger clan that reached the fourth tier, Hu Jin never thought there would be a day that he would fail his advancement and be reverted in his child form.\n\nHowever, looking at the female who saved him, the tiger Hu Jin felt that the female he always sneered became his treasure.>"
