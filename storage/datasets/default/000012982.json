	"description": "Some say Jiang An Lan is cold and aloof, unsuitable for spending a lifetime with; some say that though you could provoke the entire world, but you should not provoke Jiang An Lan as you will be made to regret it for an eternity. Some say, even, those that Jiang An Lan associates with are on the level of gods.\n\nIn Yao Yuan’s heart, she agrees.  Jiang An Lan is an existence to be observed from afar, not to be trifled with.\n\nUntil that day, after he forcefully buys, sells and yells at her. She felt that this world had become very strange.\n\nHe said: “After you see me, you will never look at anyone else again.”\n\nHe said: “You were the only one that I forcefully pursued to become my girlfriend.”\n\nHe said: “I don’t know how to pursue someone. If you would like to take it slowly, we can slow down the pace.”\n\nHe said: “Xiao Yuan… I am cruel but I will never hurt you.”\n\nDearest, are these words blunt enough?\n\nAt this moment, snowflakes landed lightly on his black hair. There is a glimmer of happiness in his eyes, tempting and tender, afterwards, I belong to you.\n\nIf you are able to leave, it is not your beloved; if you cannot leave, it is fate.>"
