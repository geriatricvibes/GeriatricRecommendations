	"description": "The day the marriage was decided with the Grand Duke of Guiller, who is rumored to be scary.\n\nEstelle screamed.\n\n“No! I haven’t even had my first love yet!”\n\nEven her marriage partner, Grand Duke Guiller, has a cold personality and is a scary man who cannot live without blood. Northern men who are blunt and conservative.\n\n𝘐 𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘭𝘥!\n\n𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦!\n\nHowever, it was not possible to avoid a marriage that had already been decided. Eventually, one day, when she was forced to prepare to marry the terrifying Northern Grand Duke,\n\nEstelle met a handsome man who was as warm and friendly as the sun. Handsome face, sweet personality. The skin burned brown as if the sun kissed him. If the word romantic becomes a person, it would be like him.\n\n‘How nice would it be to marry a man like this?’\n\nA sigh came out automatically. After breaking up with the man, she had to prepare for a wedding to become the wife of a scary person who she didn’t even know his face.\n\nJust in time, her eyes met the man who was looking at her. The man smiled playfully at her with friendly black eyes. Estelle’s face turned red and bowed her head. There was nothing to ask him in a hurry, so she quickly pulled out what she had in mind.\n\n“Come to think of it, what brought you to the capital?”\n\nHe closed his mouth for a moment and puffed his cheeks slightly. He seemed to hold back his laughter.\n\n“I’m getting married soon. I came to buy a ring for my wife.”\n\n𝘞𝘩𝘺?\n\nShe felt like she was hit on the head by something.>"
