	"description": "“I like money, food, and handsome guys.” \r\n\r\nThe next day, some young master knocked on her door. \r\n\r\n“Hundreds of millions of assets, advanced culinary skills, ten out of ten looks—three-in-one, this is a deal for you.” \r\n\r\nBai Chuxiao’s playboy-abusing rating is through the roof. Because there was a big handsome guy living next door with amazing cooking skills, she just freeloaded food and eventually gave herself over. \r\n\r\nBai Chuxiao: “You’ve been single for so long, didn’t you say you didn’t like women?” \r\n\r\nQi Moye: “Because I was waiting for you to appear.”>"
