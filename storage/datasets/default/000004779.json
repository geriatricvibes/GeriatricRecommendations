	"description": "“My fate shall not be dictated by the heavens. If the heavens dare dictate my fate, I shall erase the heavens!”\r\n\r\nMu Yuan impassively looked at the screaming monarch who was undergoing a heavenly tribulation and secretly turned the power of the tribulation up a few notches…\r\n\r\n“Since the heavens are unjust to me, I shall eradicate the heavens!”\r\n\r\nA teenager who had just transmigrated climbed to the peak of a mountain and swore. Mu Yuan, understanding that the kid wanted to return to where he came from, hurled a lightning bolt at the teenager, sending him “home”…\r\n\r\n“Our bodies are unfettered. Who can reign supreme?! Today I shall rebel against the heavens!”                     \r\n\r\n“The heavens treat the living like dogs.”\r\n\r\n“The heavens shall not cover my eyes. The earth shall not bury my will. The living shall recognize my intent. The divine shall evaporate!”\r\n\r\n….\r\n\r\nMu Yuan raised his head and sighed. Why did so many people want to die?\r\n\r\nThe story is about Mu Yuan, the world’s Heavenly Dao, the creator of his own world, treading the Way of Heaven!>"
