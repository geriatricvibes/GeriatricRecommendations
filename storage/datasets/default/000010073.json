	"description": "I possessed Melinia, the first love of male lead candidate A in the harem romance fantasy “Azley’s Glorious Misfortune.”\n\nAre you going to be happy when you’re just a supporting character? A one-time supporting character who dies instead of the male lead candidate A at the age of 10! Even if you’re free from that fate right now, the male lead A’s world will be destroyed because of his unhappy childhood by candidates B and C.\n\nTo survive, I have to alter the original a little before they walk on the canon path.\n\nSo I rescued the duke’s successor from the nursery. “I won’t be your weakness. Don’t leave me.”\n\nUnleashed the dragon in the pit. “You promised me. You’ll keep me company.”\n\nI actively approached the prince who was confined. “Will you run away from me?”\n\nThe plan is a little… wrong?>"
