	"description": "\r\nFlora, the noble daughter of Count Nazca, and Theodore, the young heir of the Duke of Astorius vowed to each other that they would marry in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, the count wanted to marry Maggie, his younger daughter born of the second wife, into the duke’s family. Due to his scheme of switching the sisters, Flora was transformed into Maggie and became unable to utter her own name because of the sorcerer’s curse.\r\n\r\nFlora was then locked up in the attic as a servant, while Maggie, who turned into Flora, was about to be wed to the duke while donned in a beautiful dress.  \r\n\r\nFlora desperately pleaded in her heart.\r\n\r\n“Please, Duke, please realize it! Duke, I’m the real Flora!”\r\n>"
