	"description": "The strongest hero of the Hero Association, also known as “Red-Hell-Fire”, “Rehel” for short, has received a bright and beautiful appearance thanks to the genes of his actress mother. That’s why he works as a hero and a model at the same time. However, his personality and demeanor is cold and cruel, which is why he is suspected of being a psychopath rather than a hero.\r\n\r\nAnd the so-called “Dark Chaos”, whose children became villains, against his will. In contrast to his appearance, he has a very gentle personality. He is an ordinary person, but the events taking place around him are not at all ordinary, especially since he has an affair with the main enemy of his children.>"
