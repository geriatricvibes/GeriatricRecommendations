	"description": "She was cruel and spicy, cold and pitiless, a notorious witch. It was said that she used her virginity as a way to cultivate evil spirits. Everyone wanted to kill her, and everyone hated her.\r\n\r\nFacing people’s slander, injustice, and disgust, she smiled charmingly, she smiled enchantingly.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in ravishing red with rosy red lips teasing young men, seducing the royal uncle, playing the imperial court, bringing down the imperial concubines, bullying royal women….\r\n\r\nShe was a poppy watered with blood in the soil of intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe world said she was too cruel to cry, but who knew that the red mole under her eye was a drop of dried blood tears!\r\n\r\nWho knew that under this seductive skin, was the world’s purest and cleanest soul!\r\n\r\nWhen love was betrayed, when loyalty was slain, just watch as she cuts through the dark clouds with her sharp edges. With her bare hands, she overcame the world.\r\n\r\nWhen everything fell apart, who was here watching her act against the world? Destroying lives, only to give her a marriage under the heavens?>"
