	"description": "The ‘Patriotic Saintess’ Astraea, who defended the kingdom from the empire’s invasion 400 years ago, became an immortal witch, set up her house in a hidden forest, and spent her life with as minimal a contact with others. However, one day, she came across an avalanche site, and naturally, saved the young man who was dying. Even though she quickly sent him away after treating him, and told him to never come back, the young man brought back delicious-smelling food as thanks--?\n\nThis is a story about an awkward witch, once called the Saintess, who hides her whereabouts, and a sincere young man.\n>"
