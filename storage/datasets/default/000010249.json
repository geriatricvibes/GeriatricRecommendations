	"description": "The leaves have fallen and I know spring will return again soon. Then, it will no longer be my season.  \n\nThe array of the setting sun filters through the window bravely,\nRosy clouds coalesce to form an extraordinary orbit —\nThey say, after a person dies, their spirit would pass by,\nAnd have a final glimpse of the world they’ve left behind…\n\n---\n\nOn the 5th of March 2002, he wore a white shirt with tattered sleeves and a pair of old, ash grey trousers as he came running into my home. It was evening and rays from the setting sun filtered through the window at an oblique angle, casting dark shadows on his left cheek. He stood ferociously before my family’s dining table. My father and I were in the middle of eating when he suddenly bellowed, “Let’s get married!”\n\nThat day, he received a stern beating from my father. He didn’t retaliate and was beaten black and blue, his face all swollen.\n\nThat year, I was 21, and without any hesitation, I married him.\n\nBecause when he looked at me, nothing else mattered. It was as though he was drowning, and only I could save him.>"
