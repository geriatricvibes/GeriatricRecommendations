The road was dark and they couldn’t see their fingers. They became panicked, gloomy, sick, and paranoid. Finally merged with the darkness.\n\nBut one day, there was a light in the darkness.\n\nThey went mad, crazy, and by fair means or foul just wanted to hold the light firmly in the palm of their hands and hold on to it till their deaths.\n\n(I could have tolerated the darkness, if I had never seen the light.)>"
