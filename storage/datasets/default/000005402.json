	"description": "He was the cool and dazzling Creator God, entering the world with the authority to oppose the heavens,\nOf course it would be a reign of terror, where he does whatever he pleases—\n\nYet it was not.\nBecause he actually forgot how to start the plug-in modifier! Pfft—!\nThe Creator God who had already forgotten how to operate the human body, unfortunately degenerated into an idiot in the eyes of others.\n\nThe poor and stupid Creator God used the initial dime given by the system to buy a cheap Shadow Guard.\nNothing cheap is good, I can only improvise like this first, and then switch him out when I have money in a few days...\n\nThree days later:\nF**k, this little Shadow Guard is so fine!>"
