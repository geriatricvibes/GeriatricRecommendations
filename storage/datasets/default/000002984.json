	"description": "In everyone’s heart dwells a demon.\r\n\r\nShe has a pen, carries an ethereal desire, and travels back and forth to different spaces.\r\n\r\nRecording many “ghost” love affairs…\r\n\r\nHeroine’s Monologue:\r\n\r\nBai Gui is my name but also the name of my pen. After collecting 100 ghosts, it will replace me to fulfill my thousand-year-old dream. With the ebb and flow of the secular world and the slow passing of time, I did not know how many times I had traveled back and forth between spaces, seen how many sorrowful partings and joyful reunions, or the old friends that I had gradually forgotten. I had no emotions but only that long-cherished wish in my heart that never changed…\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUsing a “heroine” as the main connection,  This book is composed of multiple short stories. All stories do not obstruct the other.>"
