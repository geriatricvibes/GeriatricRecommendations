	"description": "When everyone else possesses the body of a saint, a princess, or a lady (duke’s daughter), I possessed a hamster. Its hobby is to eat squirrel chestnuts. Its specialty is to pretend to be a woolsmith. Soi, who has become a pretty hamster, decided to find an owner to survive…\r\n\r\n[We are here.]\r\n\r\nSoi, who captured the sense of an owner, ran back and forth.\r\n\r\n“Chii (Raise me)”\r\n“….”\r\n“Chii (Raise me)”\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes shook when he saw the bold hamster.\r\n\r\nFinally, with cuteness as her weapon, she succeeded in being picked up by a little boy.\r\n\r\nThe hamsters’ life I had dreamed of was cozy. Sunflower seeds, sweet dried strawberries, and fluffy sawdust.\r\n\r\n[I’ll serve you properly.]\r\n\r\nOne day, the golden hamster who pledged loyalty, discovered the identity of her owner.\r\n\r\n[Is Edgar really the main character in the novel?]\r\n\r\nIn some way, she said he was so handsome.\r\nIn some way, she said he was so sweet.\r\n\r\n“Chii. Chii. Chi-!”\r\n\r\nWill she be able to protect her owner, the protagonist, from the upcoming events?>"
