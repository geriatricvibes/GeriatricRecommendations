	"description": "Chen Meimei was 180 cms tall with rolls of fat all over her body. When she walked, she would jiggle left and right, like a big pumpkin.\r\n\r\nFu Bainian was a handsome man with a tall, slender build, and wherever he went all eyes would follow him. He walked in the spotlight and lived like a movie star.\r\n\r\nWhen their parents proposed marriage, Fu Bainian sneered and thought to himself, ‘she’s a toad wishing to eat swan meat’. He firmly rejected any thoughts of marriage.\r\n\r\nBut then…\r\n\r\n“Hey look, President Fu’s following Chen Meimei again!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t President Fu slapping his face at this point?”\r\n\r\nGreat President Fu had a bitter expression on his face. He had no choice! Who decided to let the person that he’d secretly loved for so many years be reborn into the body of such a fatty?!>"
