When she recovered, she found that there were two new sentences in her diary which was undoubtedly her handwriting.\n\n——My future wife is called Bei Huai, she is very nice, and I love her very much.\n\n——Go to No.13 middle school, go to Xiao Bei, accompany her and protect her.\n\nBecause of curiosity and unknown emotions, Jiang Wan transferred to Bei Huai’s school.\n\nOn her first day of school, she ran into a few students who were scaling over the wall, dressed as punks, similar to bad students.\n\nNoticing her gaze, the most eye-catching girl who seemed to be the ringleader casually squinted over.
