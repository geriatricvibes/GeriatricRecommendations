	"description": "In the first life, she was given a cup of poisoned wine to drink; in the second life, she was hit like a hedgehog by a sharp arrows; in the third life, she became a diligent nurse who worked hard to live.\n\n(Note: the hostess only feeds. The male protagonist sucked milk) \n\nBecause all three lifetimes were all for him, Chu Ran’s eyes were black and she just wanted to die on the spot. Seeing her trembling expression, Gu Xian stretched out his slender fingers and opened her belly band, revealing a radiant and white skin on her chest.\n\nPeople feel so wonderful. He squinted his phoenix eyes happily, and his voice was low and dull: “Ran Ran… it’s time for breastfeeding.”>"
