However, God punished her unfortunate love for her brother, Ai Xian, by throwing her back to ancient Egypt using a strange serpentine bracelet engraved with a three-thousand-year-old love oath.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt was Ramses II, the great regent prince and the heir to the throne. When he met her, everything started changing, including his fate.>"
