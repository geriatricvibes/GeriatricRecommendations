	"description": "To Ji Yi, Ji Cheng Yang is the joy in her childhood, a cup of coffee in her teenage years, that kite especially painted just for her, that part of A Chinese Odyssey she never finished, that irreplaceable longing and love in her dull life.\n\nJi Yi chased after his back, followed in his footsteps, liked the things that he liked.\n\nTo Ji Yi, the whole of her youth, from the moment she met Ji Cheng Yang, was carved with only one name.\n\nTo Ji Chengyang, Ji Yi is the soft ray of light at dawn, the warmest existence, the care kept deepest in his heart. He has once, for the sake of his dreams, forsaken her, hurt her, but in the end, he returned by her side.\n\nShe is the very first of his memories, as well as the Ji Yi he loves the most.>"
