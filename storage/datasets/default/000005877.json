	"description": "The sea breeze blew across the darkened coastline, and before dawn came, the tide was high in Neverland.\n\nThe word “Neverland” held two meanings, one was the island swallowed by darkness, and the other was the name of the world’s first interactive large-scale variety show—with hundreds of millions of viewers crouching in front of all kinds of electronic devices twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
