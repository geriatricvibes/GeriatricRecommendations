	"description": "“Even if it’s my child, I can still not love them.”\r\n\r\nThe day she terminated the 5-year-long contracted marriage and filled out the divorce papers, Hilia left Caligo without a second thought.\r\n\r\nLeaving the byproduct of the contracted marriage, their child, with him.\r\n\r\nHilia Halos was a woman who was colder, more selfish, and more wicked than anyone else.\r\n\r\n[Here’s the alimony. Since I don’t need this anymore, I’ll hand it over to you.]\r\n\r\nThat was what he thought, until he ceded the baronial estate that she so coveted and disappeared.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHilia was sure she would be indifferent. About leaving the child, and about abandoning the man who brought her excitement.\r\n\r\n“Mother, you don’t, hab to, lub, Riche. Riche gonna, only come, sometime. Riche will, lub you more……”\r\n\r\nShe was actually indifferent.\r\n\r\nShe would have been in the future, as well.\r\n\r\nIf only the dirt-covered child didn’t just appear out of nowhere after four years and told her such a thing.\r\n\r\n“So……!”\r\n\r\nTears dripped down the child’s cheeks.\r\n\r\nHilia backed away from the child, who was running towards her with arms wide open.\r\n\r\nShe could not be a good parent, nor could she love anyone.\r\n\r\n“My baby, there are things in the world you just can’t love.”\r\n\r\nSo, after leaving that single comment, she turned away.\r\n\r\nPretending not to notice the unfaltering gaze in front of her.>"
