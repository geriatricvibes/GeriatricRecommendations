	"description": "I am an S ranked adventurer and for certain reasons am traveling with a certain alchemist. However, this alchemist is quite strange. In his spare time, he can make the highest grade potion called an elixir, and can complete a holy sword overnight. I want him to remember to be responsible. I want him to watch his health… stop drinking elixirs like they’re energy drinks!\n\nThis is the story of the weird alchemist who doesn’t know restraint and the adventurer who tags along with him.>"
