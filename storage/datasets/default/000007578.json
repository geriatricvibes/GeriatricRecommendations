	"description": "Fate and destiny; no one can foreshadow the terrifying challenges on the road  to the Pure Land. Instead, one may unearth the evil within the road of light towards paradise.\r\n\r\nA King’s Holy Sword, bringing light to the darkness,\r\n\r\nAn unyielding soul, igniting the fiery hope of the world,\r\n\r\nAs his soul awakens, the youth fiercely battles the gods of darkness and evil,\r\n\r\nAs the surging dark clouds gushed out like a phantom, their conflict swept the world like raging tide!\r\n\r\nThe clash of darkness and light, a massive war on the verge of exploding,\r\n\r\nThe decisive battle of gods and deities rewrite the creation of the world into one destructive epic!>"
