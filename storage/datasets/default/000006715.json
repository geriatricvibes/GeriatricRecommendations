	"description": "Six months ago, tens of thousands of black phantom towers appeared all over the world, floating above the cities. Chemists, physicists, religious people… all of them could do nothing.\n\nSix months later, people became used to the towers and no longer paid them attention.\n\nOne day, Tang Mo saw a flying insect crash into it instead of going through it. The next day, a sharp and clear child-like voice issued an announcement to all humans.\n\n“Ding dong! November 15th, 2017. The earth is online.”\n\nThe black tower’s three iron-clad rules:\n\n1. Everything is explained by the black tower.\n\n2. 6 o’clock to 18 o’clock is the game time.\n\n3. All players, please strive to attack the tower.>"
