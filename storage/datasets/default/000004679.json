	"description": "A Man who only know how to pit others, cross into the Uzumaki Naruto, with the strongest system to create the strongest harem. Keke ~ ~ said wrong, to create the strongest Hokage. An otaku: “Wait, let me see what this daily task is, um, very simple, kick the 3rd Hokage’s ass. Well, I admit that you can pit me, Hokage ass is not something a common man can kick. Or, even if you kicked, can the ANBU ninja let me go? God, who will save me.” A system: “I am God.” A otaku: “……….” “You see, I am going to do it. Isn’t it just kicking someone ass? What’s the big deal? After 18 years, Laozi will be a hero.”>"
