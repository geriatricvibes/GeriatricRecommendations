	"description": "“A cheat system? Do you take me for a fool? Nowadays, where can you find such a good thing falling into your lap? Scram from my head. Is this is new kind of fraud? Or is this a murderer training system of aliens that contains the ability of hypnotism?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am the chaos that whispers from nothingness, the nightmare of all living beings in the Southern Ten Stars, the successor of the unparalleled God and… your elder sister.”\r\n\r\n“…I only have a younger sister, I don’t have an elder sister!”\r\n\r\n“No, you have one. I am an illegitimate daughter. It’s just that your dad didn’t inform you.”>"
