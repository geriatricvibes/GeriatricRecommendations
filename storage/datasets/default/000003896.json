	"description": "“I can’t love you…”\n\nThe protagonist, Tatsumi Aizawa, is incapable of love. Ever since he was a child, he was distanced from his family. Yet, there was always a girl next to him, his best friend since childhood.\n\nHowever, in junior high, he was betrayed by that same friend. The sheer shock of that let-down caused him to lose his capability to love.\n\nEntering high school, he came into contact with a variety of different people. A noisy classmate, a slightly unusual senior, his own estranged sister… and the girl he once loved.\n\nThrough his encounters with them, he eventually gets involved with that childhood friend once more. A noisy, yet peaceful everyday life ensued, and as the days went by, his feelings gradually changed.\n\n“Will I ever be able to face her again?”\n\n—Such is the conflict that plagues his mind, yet Tatsumi has a secret locked away inside.\n\nThis is a story about a boy who can’t fall in love, and a girl who yearns for him to love her once more.>"
