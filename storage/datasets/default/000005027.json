	"description": "Lindel is the youngest vice commander of the Imperial guards who had everything but love.\r\n\r\nI made one wrong wish and started vomiting blood.\r\nIt was just an aftereffect of the contract. But the problem was that other people saw me vomiting blood.\r\nI tried to fix things up but for some reason, it gets worse and worse.\r\n\r\nNow I was a lover of the century who wished to protect the Emperor even at the risk of death.\r\n\r\n'How long have you endured this alone?'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry, I'm okay.'\r\n\r\n'I'd rather you cry! Beg to live, be angry!'\r\n'.....Don't die, please.'\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not going to die!>"
