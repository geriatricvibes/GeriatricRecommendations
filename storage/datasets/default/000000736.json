However, one day, Wataru sobers up, and has to face reality.\r\n\r\n“There’s no way I’d be a good fit for an unattainable flower like her, right…?”\r\n\r\nAfter starting to see reality as it was, Wataru proceeded to keep a certain distance to Aika, which left her in turmoil. \r\n\r\n“Does he...hate me now…?”\r\n\r\nResulting from this misunderstanding is awakening of subconscious feelings that come and go!? Thus begins the romcom of mutual one-sided feelings, plagued by misunderstandings!\r\n>"
