	"description": "At the cash register of the convenience store, I saved a really cute employee from a blond haired yankee. I didn’t know that I had already saved her once near Kichijouji station. This coincidence was really interesting.\n\nMinamino Asuka-chan.\n\nNow that I look at her again, she really was a beautiful high-schooler. \n\nI really believe this is fate! Since he saved me not just once, but twice.\n\nNakadai Eita-san.\n\nI wasn’t able to stop the ends of my mouth from loosening.\n\nThe scene is Tokyo.\n\nThis is a lighthearted, coming of age story which unravels when a group of university students from the countryside and some young girls from Tokyo meet.>"
