	"description": "I possessed a character in the novel I had been writing roughly for a year: A wicked woman who was destined to die horribly within the next two years.\n\n‘Is this the price for making the readers suffer?’\n\nAnyway, the male lead was suffering from rolling over like a hoop.\n\nFor the welfare of my creation, the poor male lead, and for my survival, I got a job at the mansion as a maid.\n\nAnd now…\n\n“Lady Laria is the best, after all. I want you to be the mistress of the Blackwell Archduchy.”\n\n“Laria is the best!”\n\n“Laria, like my mother?”\n\nThe whole family of the Archduke likes me.\n\nEven the Archduke is obsessed with me, performing all sorts of tricks…\n\n“The Lady and I are engaged.”\n\nYes? Since when?\n\n“My children and I need Lady Sherwood. I have no intention of letting her go.”\n\nWhat’s wrong with everyone all of a sudden?\n\nI just worked for the welfare of the male lead.>"
