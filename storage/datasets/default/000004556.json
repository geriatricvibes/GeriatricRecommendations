Anyone who contracted it became a zombie.\n\nThe area was quarantined for a while, but some foolish security guard let a few infected people out.\n\nSince then, the number of zombies has been increasing, but unknown to everyone, there are two people who have been quietly fighting the zombies.\n\nThey operate under the name of ” Odin’s Eye” and maintain the peace in secret.\n\nIs it the world that is rotten or the people? Their unrelenting battle knows no end.>"
