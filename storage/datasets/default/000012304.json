	"description": "“Princess of Argonia, are you God’s maid of honor?”\n\nThe aggressor of the continent stared at her through his piercing eyes.\n\nIt wasn’t that he had a sword, or that he was mocking her.\n\nHe just looked at the Princess of Argonia, as if he was going to unravel her. He was staring at her with those beautiful, cynical, cruel, cold-blooded, and horribly greedy blue eyes of his, that she thought she had committed an unforgivable crime.\n\n“W-Why are you doing this to me?”\n\n“I don’t need a reason to break flowers.”\n\nShe always just wanted to live earnestly. But neither in her hometown nor in the imperial palace, can she escape from a man who was trying to plunder her.>"
