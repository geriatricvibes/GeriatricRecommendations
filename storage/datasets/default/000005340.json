	"description": "Zhuang Yu stood on the back of a big blue fish with a stone spear in his hand. Below him were patches of green fields, with herds of cattle and sheep all over the mountains. The dark asphalt road led straight to the distance. The children were laughing as they herded cattle and sheep, while the water wheel next to them was flowing with white water. This is Zhuang Yu’s home. Originally, there was endless yellow sand everywhere, thousands of miles of barren lands, a lack of food, water, salt, and clothes. They lived the hardest life. Now, everything is different. Everyone has a happy expression on their faces and is full of hope for the future.>"
