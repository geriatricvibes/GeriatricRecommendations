	"description": "“The Empress was supposed to be my woman.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow Empress, Diane, lived as the last member of the bloodline of a rebellious family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn front of her, an unidentified man wearing an iron mask appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'That's too bad. I thought I was the first one to see the face of Prince Gotha, which everyone wanted to see.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Are you saying that you missed me?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince was as relentless as someone who took pleasure in making fun of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Then I can take it off right away.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'No! I didn't mean it like that!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she stopped him from trying to take off his mask, the Prince pulled her towards him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind completely loosened the front of the tightly-tucked gown, and the fronts of the two people met, touching one another through a see-through chemise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prince's voice echoed low inside the iron mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 'Right now, I'm holding it in, Your Majesty the Empress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment the Prince's identity was revealed outside the iron mask, Diane had already become a northern woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n>"
