	"description": "After a car accident, I woke up as the half-sister of the main villain in the novel.\n\nHaving already possessed her, I decided to lay a flower path to prevent the villain blackening.\n\nI worked hard with all my heart and strength…\n\nSomehow, I worked and worked stably with the Grand Duke of Lyserville, who was known for his bloodless murder.\n\n“Didn’t you warn me, that you wouldn’t let me go?”\n\nAfter seeing me with another man and chasing me after an affair,\n\n“Do you like me?”\n\nI asked.\n\n“Don’t be ridiculous.”\n\nI wondered why this man was so interested with my private life.>"
