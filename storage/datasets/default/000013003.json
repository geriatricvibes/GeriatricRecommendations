	"description": "Ji Huan transmigrated into 《Demons are Running Amuck》, a melodramatic BL novel that was so pathetic that the people couldn’t even be counted as people. He transmigrated into the novel’s holy relic——demon-revealing mirror.\n\nJi Huan: “…….” \n\nHe trembled as he opened his eyes and saw a handsome and aloof man leisurely wearing his (the man’s) clothes standing in front of him (JH).\n\n*splash* Ji Huan had drooled.\n\nThe man who saw suspicious-looking water spots appearing on the mirror’s surface: “? ? ? ? ?”\n\n*\n\nIn the novel, the main gong-shou pair had painstakingly looked for the demon-revealing mirror for 10 years and this object was thrown by the villain into a corner and used as a normal mirror.\n\nOne day, the boss was suddenly seized by a whim and finally intended to display the demon-revealing mirror’s true usage and used it on the disfigured frog demon, the suppurated anaconda, the enormous shipworm, the huddled together leeches…….\n\nA month later, the demon-revealing mirror started foaming at the mouth.\n\nThe boss slightly smiled: “Look nice?”\n\nJi Huan: “ ! ! ! ”>"
