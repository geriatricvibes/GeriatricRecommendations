	"description": "A painfully conspicuous master adventurer, Dale.\r\n\r\nDue to a certain request, he set foot in a deep forest and by chance, encountered a severely underweight and thin young girl of magic lineage. Unable to leave the girl, Latina, who carried the branding of a criminal, Dale reluctantly decided to become her protector. However―\r\n\r\n“Because Latina is too cute, I don’t want to go to work.”\r\n\r\n―Before he realized it, he had completely gained a parent complex!?>"
