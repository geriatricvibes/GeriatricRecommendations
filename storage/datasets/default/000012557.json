	"description": "Trying to drown her sorrow with alcohol after her boyfriend hooked up with her sister, Ning Qing ran into the rich and powerful Lu Shaoming in a bar. 'I need a wife,' Lu said, and the two got their marriage license.\n\nSoon, she who became a pop star won many pretty boys' hearts. Singlehandedly, he got rid of all her potential flings and acted innocent. Ning Qing bristled, 'Lu Shaoming, what happened to staying out of each other's private life which we talked about?' Turning the light out, he came over her and whispered, 'Now our priority is to make a baby.'>"
