	"description": "Shen Yan is the ex-girlfriend of the villain in the novel. She broke up with the villain for the sake of ‘prospect’. After the villain became rich, she crazily wanted to get back together with him.\n\nWhen she woke up, Shen Yan was reborn.\n\nIt’s just that she pulled the sleeve of the villain and asked if he could get back together with her. The villain said that if she jumped down the stairs, he could give her a chance.\n\nShen Yan ran away…\n\nAfter a few months, the villain knelt and wept bitterly, “I jumped down the stairs, can you give me a chance?”>"
