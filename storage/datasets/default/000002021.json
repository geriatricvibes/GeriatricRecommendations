	"description": "Before he realized it, he was in a different world.\n\nA former Japanese office worker woke up in the body of a baby. \n\nIt seems he’d been reincarnated in a different world…\n\nAlthough he was born into a noble family, his mother was a concubine, so his official status was that of a commoner. \n\nTo such an individual, there was one person he wants to protect. \n\nShe was his younger sister from the same mother. \n\nAnd his sister seems dead-set on never letting him go…? \n\nThe life of a reincarnated and his beloved sister begins.>"
