	"description": "Young scientist Nie Zheng encounters a strange fox-shaped meteorite during a fieldwork outing in the woods. That begins his surreal but fateful relationship with a little “feral child” he picks up. The little fox by the name of Xin starts her journey learning the language of cats, then slowly picks up the language of humans while developing a relationship with Nie Zheng. Through the power of communication, she walks into his heart across the boundaries of differences.\r\n\r\nIf love is a fire that engulfs human emotions like an incinerator, rendezvous is the boundary that leads to the fairytale ending of romance.\r\n\r\nHandcraft artist Din Rou is known as the ‘sly fox’ by her enemies. Her coincidental encounter with a certain someone in Paris marks the moment she fell in love—and the beginning of separation. A fleeting tale of love that passes by like a shooting star, only to leave vivid memories in the hearts of the young lovers.\r\n\r\nThe passing of stars indicates the start of new love. May the pursuers of true love be blessed by the starry skies to join their beloved in the romantic land of their dreams.>"
