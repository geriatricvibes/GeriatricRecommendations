	"description": "Eye-catching. Stunning. Addictive. Mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nThose were the impressions left upon those who had seen her paintings.\r\n\r\nIt was what I aspire to be, as a high school student who wishes to pursue art.\r\n\r\nNo matter what she created, they were all named as the works of “Genius”. An artist with unparalleled talent, Kashiwazaki Yuri.\r\n\r\n “I came here just to see you. I only paint what I desire.” \r\n\r\nThe one closest to me, yet also the furthest away; my childhood friend.\r\n\r\nOne day she suddenly stopped painting. But I continued to stroke my paintbrush as I chased after her shadows. \r\n\r\n“I’ll paint again and again. I won’t give up. Talent doesn’t matter.”\r\n\r\nI’m going to make her enjoy painting again. And I’d show her that my creations are superior.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of an ordinary person who devoted his youth to painting, challenging the “Genius”—.\r\n\r\nWinner of the 34th Fantasia Award 《Tachibana Koushi Special Award》>"
