	"description": "The emergence of dungeons always causes heavy damage afterward. And it is the Restorer's responsibility to rebuild the affected areas back to their original state. Among those Restorers is Yiseon Jeong, an S-class Restorer who catches public attention for his perfect restoration of buildings. He is hailed by the citizens and considered a hero. However, one day he disappears...\r\n\r\n*   *   *\r\n\r\nS-class hunter Hyeon Sa from Korea's top guild, HN, comes to Yiseon.\r\n\r\n'I'm here to scout you, Mr. Jeong.'\r\n\r\n'Like hell you are, if you're approaching me like this.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think you know what exactly 'hell' is, but...'\r\n\r\nHyeon Sa smiles.\r\n\r\nHis bright eyes look straight at Yiseon. But instead of comforting, those smiling eyes send shivers down Yiseon's back. Hyeon Sa slowly approaches the tensing Yiseon. Step by step, he bends down, brings his lips to Yiseon's ear, and whispers in a most gentle and friendly tone,\r\n\r\n'Those corpses you keep in your house, I can kill them for you.'>"
