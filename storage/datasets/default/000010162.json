	"description": "Slay, the supporter of the S-ranked adventurer's party 'Hazerushippu'(exploding wind), which is based in Central City, the royal capital, has been expelled from the party by majority vote after she became jealous of the party members over the role of the healer, Saint Elia.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was actually a good thing that Slay was working as an adventurer to earn money to become an alchemist, a dream he'd had for a long time.\r\n\r\nAfter his banishment, he headed to the magical city of Loonside, where he and his emissary, Lloyd the Great Gray Wolf, began to slowly make their way to live a slow life in the frontier of their hometown while aiming to become a qualified alchemist, as he had longed to do.>"
