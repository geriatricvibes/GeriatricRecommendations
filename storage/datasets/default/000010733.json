	"description": "I was abandoned in the house, and with only a few days left to live.\r\n\r\nI had no regrets in my life.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to accept death on the day I got married to a monster.\r\n\r\nHowever, my cute first love who became a duke and is said to be a monster was looking at me enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n'A divorce? If you want to do it, you should kill me first. Then you can ask for a divorce.'\r\n\r\nBesides, the cold-blooded mother-in-law is weird.\r\n\r\nShe says I am a fairy.\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\nI came to die, and somehow my husband and in-laws won't let me go.>"
