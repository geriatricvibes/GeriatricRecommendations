	"description": "I lived suffering without a home, religion, or parents, but an angel appeared and reincarnated me.\n\n“You, a pro when it comes to romance fantasy novels, would you like to reincarnate in a world that was created based off of a romance fantasy novel?”\n\nI reincarnated because he said I would have a (handsome) dad and a (handsome) older brother who would spoon feed me, and even gift me a diamond mine, but…\n\n-I might be a child from my mother’s affair?\n\nAs soon as I was born, I was sent to my mother’s household and fell into a family that deprives me.\n\n“If I stay like this, I might end up freezing or starving to death by myself!”>"
