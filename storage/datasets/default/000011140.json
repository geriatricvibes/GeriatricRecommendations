	"description": "He is the most watched big star in the world, he is the first person in the entertainment industry who does not do his job properly, and he is a popular favorite in Hollywood!\n\nYou may have just watched the commercial movie he starred in this year, and even the most ordinary roles are amazing; you may have listened to the album he just released, which is as moving as his handsome face; Have you seen the “Saturday Night Live” hosted by him, the audience almost burst into laughter; by the way, at this year’s Venice Film Festival, the new film he shot was the opening film, and the audience was full, with warm applause that set him up like God…\n\nEvan Bell, his handsome face can be seen on movie websites, magazine covers, and pictorial columns around the world. To him, utilitarianism and false fame are all floating clouds, and life is as gorgeous as summer flowers. He is just enjoying life.>"
