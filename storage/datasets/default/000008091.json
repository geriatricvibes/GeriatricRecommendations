	"description": "“Back when we were children, she used to be cute, but now, she’s nothing but an oh so upright noble lady, the kind which I despised the most. She’s no different from the other noble ladies now.”\n\nSuch was the complaint of Elizabeth’s fiancé, the prince, which she accidentally overheard.\n\nHuuuh—!? Isn’t it because you wished for me to become your fiancée that I had to undertake the lady’s education—!?\n\nIt is the story of a lady who fell out of love, discard the prince, and attain her own happiness.>"
