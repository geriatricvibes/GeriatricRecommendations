	"description": "After a year possessed as an extra, I picked up the dying mastermind.\n\nBut this man seems to have amnesia.\n\n“What kind of relationship were we?”\n\nAnd a strange misunderstanding!\n\n“Whenever I see you my heart beats violently, my head hurts like it's going to break, and I feel dizzy.”\n\n“Tha, that’s…”\n\n“What is it if it is not love?”\n\nThat’s not love, it’s because I smashed the back of your head.\n\n***\n\nDillian’s misunderstanding started then grew out of control.\n\n“If we’re not lovers, we’re a married couple.”\n\n“That’s not it…”\n\n“I will take care of it, I will pay you for the rest of my life.”\n\n“…”\n\n“So wife, you must not leave my side.”\n\nHis touch reached my foot. Slowly and smoothly his hand climbed up, wrapped around my ankle.\n\nAs if, it’s like I got shackled.\n\n“Lea, what if I leave, you will kill me?”\n\n“How can I do that?”\n\nHe responded lightly with a smiling voice.\n\n“I’m going to kill the man who took you.”\n\n…I think I got the wrong one.>"
