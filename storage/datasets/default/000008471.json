	"description": "Himuro Suzuha, the student council president who is a perfect model student, but has high pressure and a small talk personality. Vice president Tajima Aito, who has feelings for her, can one day hear the 'true feelings' hidden behind her words! Suzuha's true intentions—that was how harsh and harsh her attitude and poisonous tongue were all in front of her, and she was completely in love with Aito! Aito was happy to know that they had both feelings. If you know the answer, a happy ending is an easy win! \r\n\r\nSo I made a confession at once, but… \r\n\r\nI was rejected!?>"
