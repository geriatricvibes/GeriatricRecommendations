	"description": "During the ancient tribal era, the world was vast and inscrutable.\n\nThrough constant exploration, the ancients were horrified to discover that God walked the land. The Wise Beast stood ten-thousand-feet tall, trampling mountains and shattering the earth.\n\nHundreds of years later, in that dangerous environment, mankind triumphed against the giant beasts and finally built the glorious Sumerian civilization.\n\nOn that day, the Wise Beast suddenly descended, trampling over mountains and rivers and destroying the entire nation. The land and the sky crumbled. Cities collapsed.\n\nHas God descended to punish men for their sins?\n\n“I’m sorry, but you’re just ants living in my yard. You’re all over the place, and I accidentally stepped on you while passing by. That’s all there is to it.”\n\nThis is the story of a slightly disappointing Creator and his hyper-competent creations.>"
