	"description": "Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi grew up together but they didn’t become childhood sweethearts that everyone admired but became a pair of archenemies.\n\nZheng Baozhu felt that Qu Zhi was hypocritical, pretentious, and self-righteous.\n\nQu Zhi felt that Zheng Baozhu was vulgar, money-loving, and only has looks.\n\nEveryone said that they were the least likely to become lovers. \n\nTwo people’s small hair Cen Tong Tong threatened, “If they can be together, I’ll eat all the keyboards at home.”\n\nLater, that very night, she threw out all 17 keyboards in her home.>"
