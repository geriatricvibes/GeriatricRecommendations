	"description": "It’s said that a male lion would not be polite when they encounters a cub who is not their child. Gerald met such a male lion.\n\nHe regards himself as a grain reserve, but he dislikes that he is not enough to stuff his teeth, ready to fatten up before eating.\n\nGerald decided to grow up under the care of his adoptive father, and then escaped before his adoptive father starts his move.\n\nBut who knows, this fattening, it’s not that fattening?>"
