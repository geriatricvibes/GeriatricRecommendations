He must find a way to drive the ugly and cold-faced man out of the dormitory!\n\nBut why was it that every time he wanted to give him a lesson, he ended up being the one who got the lesson! And he nearly lost his “manhood!”\n\nAbhorrent son of a bitch, we cannot exist together!\n\nBut this disgusting shitty cold-faced man suddenly wants to ‘compete’ with him.>"
