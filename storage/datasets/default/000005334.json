	"description": "I, Ichigaya Aoto, am hated to death by my bloodlust sister, Ichigaya Shizuku.\r\n\r\nThe step sister who loves her brother, as is often the case in romantic comedies, is a figment of my imagination. Every day, my real step sister tells me that I’m in her way, that I should die, etc.\r\n\r\nI had gotten used to being treated like this and was about to give up on my relationship with my step sister.\r\n\r\nA lie that I told on a whim.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure what to make of it.\r\n\r\n「…Kuso Aniki… you’re hypnotized properly, right?」\r\n\r\n「O… oh… yeah… It’s done…」\r\n\r\n「Then… Kiss me」\r\n\r\n「What…?」>"
