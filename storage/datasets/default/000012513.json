	"description": "While Shen Huai was still acting in the entertainment industry…\n\nAnti-fans all over the internet: Flower-vase actors should just get out from the entertainment industry!\n\nLater, he switched tracks to play e-sports instead, and his team’s fan club collectively protested\n\n―― “E-sports do not need flower vases!”\n\nBefore the game, Shen Huai said calmly, “This match is mine.”\n\nThe audience: Bah! If you win, we’ll eat our keyboards!\n\nAfter the game, Shen Huai won the award for MVP.\n\nThe audience: Keyboards are really tasty! Boss, when will you reactivate your Weibo?\n\nThe fans from the fan club: E-sports don’t need flower vases, but husbands are welcome! Hubby, please be sure to come at me from the front!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\nThis is the story of a small movie star who had his career in e-sports delayed by acting, who finally became a big shot in his own right.>"
