However, life is dull and boring, and the serious Fu Xi seems to be a different person on the bed.\r\n\r\nf*cking her is addictive, and he doesn’t care about anything else. After work, once he takes off his suit, he f*cks her first.\r\n\r\nDivorce can’t even be mentioned. If I mention it even once, I’m sure I’ll never get out of bed the next day.\r\n\r\nAnd she gradually fell in love with the feeling of wet and soft legs every day…>"
