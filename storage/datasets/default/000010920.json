If I’m going to die anyway, I have to be a fangirl of my favorite character as much as I want!’\n\nHowever, I survived with the awakening of a power that wasn’t in the original story.\n\nWhat was worse, in the meantime, I had hit on my in-laws so well, though?\n\n“You are probably the only one who puts your life in Akid’s pictures more than the commissioned.”\n\nWouldn’t Personality Breaker 1 who was full of chills, my father-in-law, help me with my fangirling?\n\n“Then haven’t I told you to not look cute? There are many criminals in the world who aim for cute kids like you.”\n\nMy mother-in-law that was once called the ‘Haint’s Mad Dog’ the Personality Breaker 2 overprotect me severely, let alone being cold.\n\nAnd my innocent husband started to flirt with me all the time. \n\n“Lonne’s hair looks like cotton candy.”\n\n“My hair surely is a bit messy.”\n\n“Not at all. I’m just saying that I want to keep touching it all the time because it’s so soft.”\n\nI thought my existence was too dangerous for him.\n\nYet—\n\n“Lonne, can you guess who’s more dangerous now?”\n\nIt turned out that the dangerous one wasn’t me, but him, right?>"
