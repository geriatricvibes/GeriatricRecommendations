	"description": "Mingzhu was an unfavored concubine-born daughter inside her family. One day, she caught the eye of his Highness, the Crown Prince, and was directly sent to his bed. She became his outside mistress. For four or five years, she was locked up in a small courtyard without seeing the outside world. Until one day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crown prince was going to marry a wife and without any hesitation granted her a cup of poisoned wine. Only then did Mingzhu realize that she was just a toy he kept to relieve his boredom. After her rebirth, Mingzhu from the bottom of her heart had only one wish : to escape from the cold and heartless crown Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man despised her for her status that was too low and thus couldn't marry her. She said 'It's alright'. The man saw that she was well-behaved and sensible, and loved her even more, saying 'I will take care of you for the rest of my life.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMingzhu pretended to be moved on the surface, but when the time was right, she carried her pregnant belly and immediately ran away. After the person ran away, the prince only then deeply experienced how to write the word regret.>"
