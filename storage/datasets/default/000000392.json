	"description": "Rua is the granddaughter of a powerful man and a very popular voice-over idol, and I have been living in the same position as a servant.\r\n'You should be honored to be childhood friends with me!　Shashasha!'\r\nBut, but…..\r\n\r\nOne thing she did made me lose my temper.\r\nI'm done with you, goodbye pig girl.\r\n\r\nAll this time I've been in the shadows, a draw for that Pig.\r\nI thought I could finally live a normal life, but 'normal' is not so easy.\r\nFor some reason, I became popular with the beautiful girls of the S-class academy, where geniuses gather, one after another.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about a protagonist with hidden high specs who, after ' isolation' from the female protagonist, becomes popular all over the place, and was told, 'As expected of you,' 'As it should be,' regardless of his own will.\r\n\r\n>"
