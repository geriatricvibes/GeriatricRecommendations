	"description": "This is the lie in the truth, the change of daydreams in reality. No, it's the story of the souls of the changed human race. AD 2070. More than half a century has passed since the humans first got attacked by the mysterious living entity known as [Mariss].\r\n\r\n“The battle... I can't do it. It hurts to say no... Everything has already... No, I can't... Somebody, help me...”\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of Celen, the pilot of Destblum, the only Heavy Weapon that can possibly oppose Mariss, has been repeatedly sapped by the hopelessness of battle. Before going out for a sortie, she had been captured for scheming to escape, and was forcibly made to sortie on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nBut, on that day, a miracle fell onto the battlefield.\r\n\r\nA mysterious Fighter from an unknown nationality appeared with a Super Weapon not obtainable from this world and purged Mariss.\r\n\r\nThe humans were roused.\r\n\r\nEven then, the Pilot that came out from that Fighter was a carbon copy of Eirun Bazatt, the Pilot in the hugely popular anime [Doll Waltz Requiem]-!?>"
