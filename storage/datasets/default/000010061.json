	"description": "One day, I was reborn in the world of the most popular fantasy novel in the world.\r\n\r\nI was reborn not as the main character, but as Marcoy Draco, a villainous aristocrat who stands in the way of the main character.\r\n\r\nBorn into an elite family of dark wizards, Marcoy is destined to ultimately fall into darkness and ruin.\r\n\r\nKnowing the ending of the original story, I don’t want to die, so I vow to live as a decent human being.\r\n\r\nFor now, I thought… to stay away from the hero, but I intercepts the hero’s events.\r\nAnd take the heroines one after another.\r\n\r\nWait, wait, wait, I don’t want to do that!\r\n\r\nI found out that my position and the hero’s were reversed… and the hero fell into the darkness!\r\n\r\nThis is a story about me, who was only an intruding character, who (as a result) takes everything away from the hero. Why!>"
