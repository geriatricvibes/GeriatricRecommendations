	"description": "Suddenly, Mozuya Kou finds himself sent to the wartorn Nemesis system; on an alien planet, Asia, in the far future. In this bleak future where deadly autonomous weapons called Murders roamed, he ends up finding the abandoned mass-production machine [TSW-R1 Lanius]. He then pilots it to defeat his enemies only through using Lanius’ sole weapon – a gigantic greatsword – and his own swordsmanship skills.\n\nBeing granted the [Development Engineer] qualification, Kou was tasked to design and develop various weapons and equipment while working together with companies that have also been sent over from Earth.\n\nHe and his allies will need to go up against deadly murder machines and enemy forces in order to survive on the wartorn planet, Asia.>"
