	"description": "Scarlett, the youngest of The White Family, grew like a plant in a greenhouse. \n\nUnfortunately, she was killed by the son of her father’s lover, Noah Ash Ford.\n\nBut when she opened her eyes, time went back to before she died, 200 days before she was killed. \n\nSo she decided not to have a meaningless death in this life and swore to get her revenge on Noah Ash Ford.\n\n“Noah, trust me, whoever or wherever you’re from.” \n\nI hate your birth and I hate your mother.  For the sake of revenge, I could do this kind of acting.\n\nOne day, his eyes changed as he looked at her. “Scarlett, I exist for you. You’re sick because of me… I’m sorry I love you.”\n\nShe gave a cruel smile on her lips as soon as she saw the love in his eyes. How dare you love me? You, I’ll kill you and then go to hell. Remove you with this hand and I say, “I love you.” I will live in the same hell as you.>"
