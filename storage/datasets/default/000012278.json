	"description": "The Lord of Soltielie, Chris von Vahly, was a beautiful young man known as the “nobleman among noblemen” in his social circles, a perfect human being to anyone who saw him for his contributions to his territory’s development and his excellence from a young age.\n\nHowever, Chris also had a huge secret: she was a girl forced to hide her true gender due to unavoidable circumstances.\n\nSuch a Lord disguised as a man decided to marry a certain barony’s daughter because of that.\n\nThough Chris thought she would be fine with any reasonable partner, she finds herself gradually changing because of his wife’s sunny disposition.>"
