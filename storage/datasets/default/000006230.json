	"description": "“The groom ran away right now, right? Oh my god.'\r\n\r\nThe man she had promised to marry, no, the man who had even entered the wedding hall with her, ran away with another woman.\r\n\r\nAnd that day, Ha-Jin suddenly appeared in front of Hae-Soo, who was drinking alone at a local food stall instead of getting on a plane to leave for her honeymoon.\r\n\r\nHa-Jin, the younger brother of her best friend.\r\n\r\nShe called him ‘puppy' and loved him since childhood, and he brought up unexpected words to her:\r\n\r\n“Sleep with me.”\r\n\r\nHa-Jin, who she only thought of as her brother, shook her up.\r\n\r\n“Forget everything for a week and stay with me. Just, don’t think about anything.”>"
