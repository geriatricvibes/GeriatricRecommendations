	"description": "'From now on, I will begin the execution of Empress Kilianerisa Sei Respontia.”\r\n\r\nThe notorious Empress Kilianerisa died that way.\r\n\r\nAfter her death, the empire was at peace.\r\n\r\nNo one welcomed her, so it was a better death.\r\n\r\nShe was a villain according to the public opinion, so her death was justified.\r\n\r\nCallisis did not deny it.\r\n\r\nIt's just that today is just another day in a slightly worse mood than usual.\r\n\r\nAt least for others.>"
