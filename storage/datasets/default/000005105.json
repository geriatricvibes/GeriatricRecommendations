She couldn’t look at people and speak.\n\nBut she had a crush on a man.\n\nClenching her teeth and stomping her feet, Xian Bei turned around. ”I-I-I li-li……” For a long time, she was blushing and sweating.\n\nAnd so he hugged her from behind and whispered, “Me too.”\n\n—— I have tasted thousands of flavors, but I only love this one.>"
