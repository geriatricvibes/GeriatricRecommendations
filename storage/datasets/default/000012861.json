	"description": "This isn't a game designed just for entertainment, and it didn't just appear in front of me for no reason - even the class I received wasn't a coincidence. This truly is such a hateful world...but since it’s already come, I can only take up that broken sword once again.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Sword of Hope I discarded, I will rid this chaotic world of evil! I will step on the path of endless darkness, cutting down all evils that disturb the world!>"
