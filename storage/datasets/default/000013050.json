	"description": "Master martial artists were beings that no one can obstruct. A martial arts expert has been reborn into the body of a genius whose cultivation has been abolished and has been abandoned by a woman. Therefore, he starts cultivating the art of Xing Yi Quan, producing a solar system within his dantian. His innate talent tramples over all the geniuses, and even the geniuses among geniuses.\n\nHis powerful spirit and ruthless and ambitious nature, no matter who he is reborn into, will never change! Slaughter is instinctive, being cold-blooded is his personality, exterminating an entire family is only a means towards a goal, cruelty means infamy, and chasing after women… is just an interest.>"
