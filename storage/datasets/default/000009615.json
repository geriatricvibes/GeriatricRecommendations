	"description": "On my way home from work, I stopped by a convenience store, bought some bento, and thought I'd finally arrived home.\r\n\r\nThe standard explanatory character didn't appear. Thanks to that, I don't even know why I'm in this situation. It's so unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThat's right, the liquor and toys I ordered online were supposed to arrive today!　They should have been in the delivery box I was reaching for! I yelled, then a strange board appeared in front of me.\r\nItem box? Delivery box? An online store? What the hell is this?\r\n\r\nAnyway, can I do something with this?\r\nThat's what I thought, but then I was confronted with a shocking fact.\r\n\r\n[Resale prohibited!]\r\n\r\nWell, it looks like there are still some ways to do it. I'll just have to use this item box to live in this world.>"
