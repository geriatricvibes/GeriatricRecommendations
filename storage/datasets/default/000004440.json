	"description": "“I’ll just choose the human Priest then. What name should I use?”\n\n“ASD.”\n\n“Using your initials as ID is so lame.”\n\n“QWE aren’t just my initials,” he said coolly. “They’re the first three letters at the top of the keyboard.”\n\n  •\n\nShe looked at the short little female dwarf knight on her screen and keyed the three letters in. System prompt: Character successfully created.\n\nQWE, the once all-powerful ID was now gone.\n\nAll that was left was the six worn out letters, QWE and ASD, nestled quietly together on the far left of the keyboard.\n\n  •\n\nLove is a boundlessly vast sea, and you are my only driftwood. A work of profound romance eagerly anticipated by thousands of readers after A Slight Smile is Very Charming. Four years of regard, three years of wait; going round in circles, turns out you are still here.\n\n\nT/N: this novel is dropped, kindly contact the TL if you wish to pick it up>"
