	"description": "I am Shiraishi Serina. I am a second year high school student at Sakurafu Girl’s Academy. One day, I tried to create an ID for a social game, as recommended by a friend.\n\nHowever, the site that came up in my search, “Game to Change Your Life,” didn’t have a field for me to enter my name, and there was a discrepancy between my friend’s explanation and what I was told. When I thought something was wrong, I was suddenly knocked unconscious and summoned naked to a magic circle.\n\nIt was a medieval European-style fantasy world where magic and monsters existed. According to the king, I’m a “hero” and he wants me to defeat the demon king.\n\nAll right, I have to find a way to cooperate with the five other heroes who were also summoned, defeat the Demon King, and quickly return to Japan.\n\nThis is a spinoff Otherworldly Warriors with erot*c Skills>"
