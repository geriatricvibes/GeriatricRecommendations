	"description": "While going to the convenient store, I was asked by a little girl “don’t you want to come to a different world?” I chased after the little girl and if one had looked around, one could have taken note of the forest around me, that my smartphone was out of range, and of the monster that was right in front of their eyes.\r\n\r\nI hit on a usual little girl one time, and because of that I minded myself to seclusion in the forest for 1,000 years to campaign against wickedness (sorcery) or to carry extreme fights of close contact in order to absolutely never again do it once more.\r\n\r\nBecause the elf girl picked up by chance was decided to be brought up, a slow life was decided to be spent for the time being by two people.>"
