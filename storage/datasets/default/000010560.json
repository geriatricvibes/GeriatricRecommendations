	"description": "The first prince of the Kingdom of Zavanni, William Zavanni.\n\nHe could not imagine being protected by someone weaker than himself, and so, on his own merits, he rose to the position of vice-captain of the royal guard and began to train with them, unaware that rumors surrounded him. The King and Queen are worried about him and gather all the young ladies of the Zavanni Kingdom who are above the Count’s rank.\n\nThe countess, who, without making eye contact, was suddenly made the fiancée of the first prince.\n\n…That doesn’t make any sense.>"
