	"description": "Appearance, wealth, the trait of the dominant Alpha, and even a beautiful wife who could stand as a trophy.\r\n\r\nThere was no flaw in the life of ‘Woo Seung-joon’, which was perfectly crafted like a diamond.\r\n\r\nUntil the world's most beloved wife, 'On Ji-an', asked for a divorce.\r\n\r\n“I also want to meet Alpha who is eight years younger than me.”\r\n\r\nShould you make 'Woo Seung-joon's’ marriage a failure just for that reason?\r\n\r\nIn a desperate moment when he has to change the heart of his wife who has been asking for a divorce, Seung-joon... He returned to his 20-year-old body!\r\n\r\nIt's top secret that the only successor of the TK group has turned into a slimy 20-year-old youngster overnight.\r\n\r\nSeung-joon thoroughly disguised his identity as ‘Seon Woo-young’ and wandered around his wife ‘On Ji-an’, who was preparing to return to the entertainment industry under the stigma of…“The nation’s first love who disappeared after married his sponsor.” \r\n\r\n“Ji-an-ah, I’ll become the man you will love again.”\r\n\r\nSeung-joon (aka Seon Woo-young, a trainee at SJ Entertainment) has become 8 years younger than his wife.\r\n\r\nWould he be able to make On Ji-an, his wife, who has despised him for the past two years of their marriage, fall in love with him again?>"
