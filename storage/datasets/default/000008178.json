	"description": "Before being framed and sentenced to a lethal injection death penalty, Zhao Yu used to be a  street ruffian who fought recklessly without morals or a bottom line. But when Zhao Yu woke up reincarnated in a parallel universe, he found that he was no longer a criminal but a Key Case Investigation Team agent.\n\nThe change from a criminal to a police officer had thrown Zhao Yu off and had him wreak havoc for the first few days in the station. But with the help of a mysterious “Miracle system,” Zhao Yu was able to embark on a new life where his goal is to solve the unsolvable cases and make amends for his past life’s mistakes.>"
