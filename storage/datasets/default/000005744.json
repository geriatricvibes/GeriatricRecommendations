	"description": "After a failed attempt at killing the heroine in the original novel, she died miserably.\n\nShe did her best to put some distance between her and the two male leads and lived as if they were dead.\n\nBut\n\n“Sister, why did you suddenly…….”\n\nHis eyes grew wretched and began to shake. Transparent tears began to trickle down from those pained eyes.\n\n“Why are you addressing me so formally…? Do you hate me now?”\n\nWhat the hell, I never expected this to happen. The more I avoided them, the more obsessed they became.\n\nIn addition\n\n“Master, I know that I have a soft spot when it comes to you.”\n\nThe moonlight shone onto his white hair.\n\n“But you know, I won’t give in to just anybody…….”\n\nBearing dark red eyes, he continued his words, tapping his fingers on his chest in a very steady pace.\n\n“My heart is in so much pain.”\n\n“…….”\n\n“That’s not right?”\n\nEven the men who weren’t involved in the original novel started to twist.\n\nStop it! That’s raising a death flag…!>"
