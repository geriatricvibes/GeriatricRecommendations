	"description": "It all started when a minute before we began morning activities, something suddenly occurred. The floor started shining a dazzling light, the shining expanded in an instant, and 30 classmates, including me, were laying on top of a place we didn’t recognize.\n\nAfter that, we met a king-like person who said “I want you to look for the seven swords.” Everyone refused at first, but since I wanted to stay in this world, I opened the mouth I kept closed up until that point.\n\nThen when I checked my status, I had nothing but surprise.\n\nThere was only one reason for that─\n\nEveryone’s initial skills given to them were strong skills, but in contrast, the skill I was given went way too far into the ‘bad skill’ territory. It was an abnormal status doubling skill.>"
