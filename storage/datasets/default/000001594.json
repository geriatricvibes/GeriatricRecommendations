	"description": "There are three treasures in the imperial city: Me, my husband and my mother-in-law. \n\nSu Guifei¹ was favoured and envied by countless Imperial consorts in the harem. Chen Wang² grew up with His Majesty showing favouritism to him. However, anyone, who was more or less educated, would sigh with regret and say that this pair of mother and son were sure to come to a bad end in the future. \n\nMing JiuZhu, who was about to marry Chen Wang: Really? I don’t believe it. \n\nChen Wang in JiuZhu’s eyes: a beautiful and kindhearted little fairy boy vs. Chen Wang in the eyes of others: His Majesty’s and his favoured consort’s hedonistic son. \n\nJiuZhu often wondered why people always gazed at her and Chen Wang with a ‘you are doomed one way or another’ look. Could this be the ugly side of jealousy? \n\nAiyah, the hearts of these people are so dirty.\n--------------\n¹ Guifei – Noble Consort\n² Wang – Title given to adult sons of the Emperor.>"
