	"description": "Even though he lived in America, Tang Cu had been deemed the 'godly author' since his debut 8 years ago on a famous Chinese online novel website. However, many people did not know he had a severe social anxiety disorder which caused him to be considered 'cold.' After being invited to do an interview for the company's 10 year anniversary celebration in China, he finally gathered his courage to meet with his #1 fan, Pian Yu. \n\nPian Yu had been following Tang Cu's novels for his entire career and, after noticing the lack of romance in Tang Cu's popular novels, they wrote fanfiction for his novels to include the 'romance' Tang Cu left out. \n\nHowever, Pian Yu turned out to be a male college student named Lu LianGuang. >"
