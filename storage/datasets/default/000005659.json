	"description": "Xu Luoyang, new movie star, Internet addict. Early in the morning, he updated a morning selfie with the text, “I wish there was someone who would wake me up every morning with a kiss, ugh, the extravagant hope of a single dog!”\n\nA minute later, Qi Chang’an reposted the post and commented, “I’m here to fulfill your extravagant wish. ”\n\nAfter seeing the #Gu Cheng CP on the top of the hot search list, Xu Luoyang was so scared that he dropped his phone. Retrieving the phone, he replied with a bitter face, “I won’t sleep anymore, okay?”\n\nIn the evening, Qi Chang’an clicked on his follow list and found that Xu Luoyang’s small account had updated another Weibo post, “I’ve been taken in by a demon, and he said he’d wake me up every morning with a kiss! I’m so panicked!!! QAQ”\n\nAfter reading it, real human Qi Chang’an liked the post.>"
