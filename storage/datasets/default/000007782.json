	"description": "Cheng Xirong died accidentally while filming a blast scene. Unexpectedly, he was reborn. Although he was not satisfied with his new body and identity, he found it acceptable because he had a huge film fan with him from his previous life. That guy could write scripts, direct movies, run errands for him and cook for him.\n\nCheng Xirong asked, 'How much do you like your idol?'\n\nFu Zhou answered, 'I like him a lot more than you.'\n\nCheng Xurong said, 'Actually I'm your idol.'\n\nFu Zhou said, '...I'll give you whatever you want.'>"
