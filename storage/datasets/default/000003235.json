	"description": "I possessed the villainess of a female-oriented game. But the role of a villain is usually difficult.\r\n\r\nIrritating family, cheating fiancé, subordinates who cross the line.\r\n\r\nIsn't this the condition for any saint to become a villain?\r\n\r\nI tried to be nice though, because I knew that if I acted like a villain I would die.\r\n\r\n▶ (Pour hot water on her)\r\n\r\n▶ (Slap her cheek)\r\n\r\nCan't I speak what I want? Do villains have no human rights?\r\n\r\nJust as I was dying of frustration, a man approached me.\r\n\r\n'Why do you have a different expression than what you said It's interesting.'\r\n\r\nIs this man normal?>"
