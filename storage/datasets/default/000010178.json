	"description": "The father of my child lost his memory before the wedding date. The person who was once loving and sweet had turned cold. The moment Anais looked into his eyes, she could foresee everything coming to an end.\r\n\r\n“You truly do not remember who I am?”\r\n\r\nA love that overcame the difference of status. If he cannot remember her, then she had no reason to stay in this place anymore. But-\r\n\r\n“I only ask once. I was told that you made medicine to help with my insomnia. ”\r\n\r\nTodd grabbed the tea bag out of his pocket and threw it on the table. The contents of the tea bag weren’t medicine, but instead, it was filled with the herbal tea leaves she gifted him a long time ago.\r\n\r\n“Let me make an offer. Gather your things and come back to the estate. I’ll make you my official pharmacist.”\r\n\r\nAnais calmly stared at Todd.\r\n\r\n“I refuse.”>"
