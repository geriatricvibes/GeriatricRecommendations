	"description": "The Prince believed every one of that woman’s lies and broke off his engagement with me. Even when I cried and begged for them to stop, that woman’s hired thugs came after me. As she saw all these tragedies happening to me that woman, my sister, sweetly smiled…\n\nA year later, I was reborn as her daughter.\n\nKeeping both the memory and burning vendetta from my previous life, I had been given a second chance. I cast aside the weak person I was before in order to prepare for my counterattack. That was the only way I could crush all of my enemies.\n\n…Now, it’s time to begin. I shall have my revenge on that woman.>"
