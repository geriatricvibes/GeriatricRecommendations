	"description": "'Do you want power? The power to cut down your enemies? The power to get revenge?'\r\n\r\n'I- I do!'\r\n\r\n'Then, accept this eye but be aware of the consequences that come along with the sin which it bears. Do you accept?' The girl asked.\r\n\r\n'Yes, YES!' The boy cried.\r\n\r\n'Excellent.' The girl smiles and thrusts the eye into the boy's skull.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAge was a happy boy. He had caring parents and he loved his little sister very much. Until they were taken from him. The magicians came into his village and razed it to the ground, killing everyone besides him and instead taking his sight, dooming him to forever live in despair. He went like this for a year blind, begging, all in hopes to finally seek revenge on those who had doomed him to this life. Then, he meets a girl. The girl with the evil eyes changed everything.\r\n>"
