	"description": "The Mad Dog of the Empire, Arne, the strongest knight ever. \r\n\r\nShe is forced to marry at the torch of her parents. \r\n\r\n'If you don't like your husband, you have to kill him and come back.' \r\n\r\nBut nobody ever told me that my husband was so handsome? \r\n\r\n“You’re like glass, so I’m afraid to have you broken.”\r\n\r\n Besides, my husband treats me like fragile ceramics. \r\n\r\nArne, who is not weak at all, and her obsessed husband Cassian. \r\n\r\nA narrowly illusory romance where misunderstandings and misunderstandings overlap!>"
