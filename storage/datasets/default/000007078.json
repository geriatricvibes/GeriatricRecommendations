	"description": "I actually knew the truth.\r\n«I didn't marry my wife because I loved her.»\r\n\r\nSo it's not his fault.\r\nIt was all my fault to have false expectations.\r\n\r\n«I just signed a contract with her based on needs.»\r\n\r\nThree years as his wife.\r\nI tried hard to be the right woman for him, but I couldn't get a piece of his heart.\r\n\r\n«I didn't know it would last this long. It's annoying.»\r\n\r\nI was nothing to him to the extent that I was thrown away as soon as the heroine appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the main character was the main character and the extra was the extra. No matter how hard I try, I'm just an annoying extra.\r\nThe role hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nSo it's right for me to leave.\r\n«I'm sorry I've been bothering you all this time. Please be happy with her.»>"
