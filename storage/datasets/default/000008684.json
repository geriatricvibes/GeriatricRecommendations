	"description": "Born and raised in a remote village, Sheila entered the Royal Academy dressed as a man to become the knight of her dreams. However, what awaited her there were only characteristic and beautiful aristocrats. She was able to overcome the prejudice and harassment against commoners, and her natural thickheadedness and good-natured attitude allowed her to gradually gain a place in the school.\r\n\r\n“What? Only nobles have magical powers? But, everyone in our village could use spirit magic.”\r\n\r\nIf the spiritual arts that shook the country to its very foundations and her gender were discovered, she’ll be instantly kicked out! Sheila’s tightrope walking dormitory life began!>"
