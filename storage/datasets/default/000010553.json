	"description": "Raynord Dusseldorf was the kingdom’s best magician, while I was but a commoner. \r\nHe seemed untouchable at first, but after getting to know him, I concluded that he was simply incapable of taking care of himself.\r\nAs such, I decided to assist him whenever I could.\r\nAt the same time, I was definitely beginning to be bound by that troublesome magician, who disliked social interactions.>"
