	"description": "She was possessed by a book without knowing what novel it was. \r\nThen, one day, her fiance appeared.  \r\n\r\n‘Killian’ was a perfect Northern Duke with black hair, red eyes, and a handsome face.  \r\n\r\nIt was a contract marriage. \r\n\r\n‘I can see that person is the male protagonist even if I rolled backwards…’ \r\n\r\nSo, Sophia believed without a doubt. She thought he would be the male protagonist.  \r\n\r\nBut…  \r\n\r\n“Ah, I got caught.”  \r\n\r\nThe smell of blood came on the tip of her nose. \r\nKillian’s eyes narrowed. \r\nThen she realized the fact that he was a villain.  \r\n\r\nAnd a cold hand caressed her cheek.  \r\n\r\n“There won’t be a breakup, Sophie.”  \r\n\r\nRaising the corners of his lips slightly, he whispered softly.  \r\n\r\n‘I think this is also a cliché… I hate that cliché!’>"
