	"description": "This is a story about how a female character in Jinjiang made others suffer after having discovered her tragic fates under the pen of the author. \n\nThe protagonist says, “If I’m thrown into misfortunes by heaven, I’ll have to turn the entire world into tragedies.\n\nThe lord, king, general, scholar, master of evil cult who don’t do anything important, but only talk about s*x or love, will have to pay direly.\n\nIf you don’t go to hell, who will?”\n\nIn an illogical place like this, where any bizzarre things can happen out of nowhere, the heroine will transform into the Ultra(wo)man, fend off ugly monsters and keenly twist sufferings into honor.\n\nNote: Xiaoxiang (xxsy) & Jinjiang (jjwxc) are 2 largest web literature sites for Chinese novels. Xiaoxiang novels often have male leads lacking ethics & noble qualities => slag heroes>"
