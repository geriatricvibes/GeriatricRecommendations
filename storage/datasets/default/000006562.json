	"description": "My name is Lillie Rivale, 5-years-old.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the “Sacred Machines” for the first time, I was so excited that I regained my memories of my past life.\r\n\r\nThis world was the setting of the otome game I played then, and I became the villainess who becomes the rival of the main character.\r\n\r\n… But what I played was the bonus mecha action game. I don’t even know a thing about the main otome game.\r\n\r\nNo matter what kind of ruinous end awaits me, it doesn’t matter if I become the strongest in the world, second to none!\r\n\r\nFather! Train me how to pilot a Sacred Machine!\r\n\r\n… Huh? It’s no good because I’m still a young child?? No way~>"
