	"description": "From now on, a battle of sponsors aiming to fill the positions of noble knights will begin.\n\nClash! A knight collector!\n\n…Lauren transmigrated into a nameless game that wasn’t even announced.\n\nBad ending, gambling ending, escape ending, and knight ending. I saw all the unfortunate endings, yet I never reached the happy ending at all, and I’m still struggling as a player to get it.\n\n‘I’ll get out of here this time!’\n\nSo Lauren decides to get out of the game by attacking all five knights…\n\nStrangely, it’s easier to attack them?>"
