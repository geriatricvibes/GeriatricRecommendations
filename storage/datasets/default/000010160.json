Thus, I decided to find my own place in the world…\n\nI didn’t need a man anymore, nor did I need to get married.\nThe moment they learned about my superhuman strength, they were all going to call me a monster, anyway.\nNo matter how hard I tried, it wasn’t like my strength would just vanish one day. Besides, how long would I be able to hide it for? \nI wanted to live with this power without needing to hide it.\n\n\nThus I, Narisa, who have too much strength, decided to join a party of adventurers and carry their bags for them.>"
