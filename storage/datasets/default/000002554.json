	"description": "Civilization is the result of wisdom and necessity, while power is simply strength.\r\nAs long as there's desire, demonkind is everlasting.\r\nYou can become a demon in a single thought born from the heart. \r\nSet your heart straight and be free of demons.\r\n\r\nThere's a proverb among immortals that one should only envy mortals and never immortals, because happiness lies in the mortal world. \r\nBecoming a superhero is a child’s dream, but attaining immortality is the dream of all living beings. The author will do his utmost to give a fairly logical account of a cultivation world to y’all. Hope y’all will support me. \r\nAfter all, since our world hasn’t been completely explored by people, no one can really say what does and what doesn’t exist.>"
