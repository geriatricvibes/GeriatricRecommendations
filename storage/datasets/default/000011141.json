	"description": "The imperial power alternates as quickly as waves on the ocean. The girl in the dark moon forest, raised by wolves, is stuck in the fog. If she does not leave the mountain, she may live a life without any worries in the dark moon forest, but the fog was too thick and she could not see. Instead of going to the wolf pack, she left the dark moon forest. On her way, she collided with the royal powers of the countries, and the heroes of the world.>"
