	"description": "In the Kingdom of Elgrand was a certain daughter of a Count.\r\n\r\nCaptivating men and women, young and old with her beauty, she controlled them as she pleased. Those who resisted were spared no mercy. For her own enjoyment, innumerable people were met with misfortune.\r\n\r\nAs ravishing as she was cruel, a thorny, icy flower.\r\n\r\n“Erm, who is this supposed to be again…?”\r\n\r\nThis is the story of an incessantly misinterpreted noblewoman and the womens’ battlefield known as the palace harem. Full of ups and downs, but somehow ending happily.>"
