	"description": "No common contact whatsoever, and I got liked by her… and my school life got drastically changed!?\r\n\r\nHaving been spending my days only studying without even a single friend, I saved her out of just a mere whim.\r\n\r\nThat’s how it should be, but—\r\n\r\n“I could hardly wait for after school! …Hey, kiss me.”\r\n\r\nThat incident led me to start dating Shino.\r\n\r\nSpending time together after school, going along with each other’s hobbies, frequent sleepovers…\r\n\r\nShe is kind and always sticks to me.\r\n\r\nMoreover, my classmates took notice of me, gave me a makeover, and my surroundings also got noisy.\r\n\r\nIt’s making me more restless than when I was alone, but… well, I guess this kinda school life is also not bad.>"
