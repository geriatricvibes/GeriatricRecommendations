	"description": "I was reincarnated as the heiress of a conglomerate in the novel. However there was a problem, this world was about to be destroyed by a virus monster.\n\nAll I have left is money, I quickly bought in the countryside and built a shelter to avoid monsters…The world went down much faster than I expected, f*ck!\n\nAnd somehow, even the male leads are trapped with me in my house. But it doesn’t seem like these two wanted to leave. Why is it as if you guys have no intention of going to the female lead?\n\n“What the hell are you?”\n\n“I think she knew about the fact that the world would be destroyed.”\n\nThey had a lot of questions for me but I couldn’t answer them. It’s not like you’re going to believe me anyway, right? Now, in my eyes, they just look like good manpower resources.\n\n“Now let’s get to work, pay as much as you eat!”\n\nIf we manage to find a cure for the virus, the cause of the world’s collapse, our hellish times will be over. So, let’s roll the male leads until then and hold out!\n\nBut there’s one problem. This old mansion I bought turned out to be quite suspicious. What the hell is going on in my house?>"
