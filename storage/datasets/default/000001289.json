	"description": "High school student Seigo Konoe was hospitalized from having too many part-time jobs. Having been banned by his family and school from taking on part-time jobs, he now had nothing to do. \n\nHe was encouraged by a friend from school to try playing the new VRMMORPG, ‘Elysion Online’ which was going to be released soon.\n\nHaving nothing to do, he thought of playing games to kill time and decided to play a VR game for the first time.\n\nSeigo, who started up the game, named his avatar Takuto and began to play as a summoner. His first summoning called forth a cute girl from the Dragon race. Naming her Lily, Takuto sets out on a journey with her to the world of EO.\n\nAnd after working numerous part-time jobs, he showcases his talents in the world of VR. As the game became enjoyable, he grew into a great gamer before he knew it.>"
