	"description": "A common medieval fantasy world. A fantasy world of swords and magic.\r\nA knight protects the country, and an adventurer opens up the unknown. There are elves, dwarves, dragons, and demons. Such a common, usual world.\r\nPhilip Carter, a country boy abducted by a cult, was turned into a dubious ritual offering-knowing everything and giving up.\r\n\r\nThe story of a helpless and worthless boy who lives in a bubble-like world.>"
