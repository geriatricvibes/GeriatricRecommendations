	"description": "Xu Sheng of Class Seven never wore school uniforms. He was the wildest person in Lin Jiang Sixth High School’s history of tyrants. He scored an average of 30 points in each subject and had so many disciplinary notices that they were meaningless. Every few days, he would be subjected to present a disciplinary review in front of the entire school.\n\nThe sun blazed in the sky and the youth’s voice was loud for everyone to hear. “Sorry, I still dare next time.”\n\nAnd the so-called Exam God, number one in the grade, Shao Zhan, was cold and unapproachable. \n\nTheir paths would never have crossed if they didn’t switch bodies due to an accident.>"
