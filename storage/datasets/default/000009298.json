	"description": "Su Xiaoxin, a comic book author didn’t make a penny out of it. But it all changed when she moved to this eight-story, old residential building. Her readers with the manuscript fees took a sudden leap.\r\n\r\nThe readers praised her vivid imagination…\r\n\r\nBut in fact, there was no imagination in her comics…\r\n\r\nShe drew her real life!\r\n\r\nVampires, zombies, corpses and elves are not from her imagination, but sitting face to face with her, they ate a hot pot!>"
