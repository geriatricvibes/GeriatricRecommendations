	"description": "Though her mother-in-law always picked on her, Qu Wan’s love for her husband had never changed until one day, a woman came to her and claimed that she was pregnant with her husband's child. After leaving the Ling family flat on her back without a penny, Qu Wan was reduced from Mrs. Ling, who had been admired by everyone to a penniless wretch overnight. She thought she would never have anything to do with Ling Mubai in her remaining years, but fate brought them together again. “Please! Leaving me alone is all I ask of you!” “Last time I checked, you still have my sperm! How can I let you go easily?”>"
