	"description": "Six people have been close friends since elementary school. However, one of them, Etsuji Ninomiya, starts to feel uncomfortable after entering junior high school. “Eh? Isn’t everyone getting more cuter and cooler compared to me?” Feeling plain compared to his friends, he felt troubled until he decided, “I’ll go to a different high school.” He separated himself from them, and then time passed. The day he went to his high school, “Everyone of them is here though?”\r\n\r\nThis is a story of friendship and love written on the theme of relationships that might be changed by differences in their appearance and position.>"
