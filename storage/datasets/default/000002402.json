In front of him was a silver-haired peerless beautiful girl.\n\nShe was a shinigami. Her job was to cull souls, and to send them to a different world as regulation. He who still had life span left but got culled, was arranged to receive a privilege after reincarnating as an apology, and obtained 『the Command ability to manipulate the structure of the world』.\n\nHe will freely use his Command Manipulation to rewrite each and every thing, and aim to become the god of the different world in his new life.>"
