	"description": "My father ostracized me. Not only did he not help me when my sister took my fiancé, but he also ordered me to marry a man with the worst reputation, known as the “Ugly Duke”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it looks like fun!”\r\n\r\nLucrezia, who had been mistreated since childhood, took this as a trial of love and, with misguided positive thinking, did as she was told and set off to meet the Duke. However, the man who greeted her was not at all like the rumors she heard about, and his appearance was strange.\r\n\r\n“―Oh? Is there anything wrong with this person?”\r\n\r\nI thought a fun ordeal awaited me, but there were no signs of it at all, and the “Ugly Duke” has regained his true appearance and is happy as one can be.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lucrezia's family and former fiancé realized how important a role she played after she disappeared, but it was already too late and the whole kingdom was heading for ruin.>"
