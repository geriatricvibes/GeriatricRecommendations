	"description": "Wang Jin found a beautiful drunk mixed-race boy on the side of the road. He looked pretty at night and couldn’t help bringing him home and sleeping with him. When he woke up the next day, he found out that the beauty was a minor.\n\nThis is the story of two people who met by chance, their lives turning from narcissism and selfishness to falling in love with each other’s trivialities.>"
