Outrageous relatives at the door? Scram.\n\nHer days begin to flourish by relying on knowledge from the 21st century. But the little bun begins to shout all day long, “Mother, find me a father.”\n\nA wild man suddenly jumps out and wraps himself around her, while claiming to be the little bun’s father.\n\nThe little bun: “My mother said that my father must first be tall and handsome!”\n\nA certain man: “This Shizi [heir to a noble title] is the world’s most handsome man!”\n\nThe little bun: “My mother said that my father needs to have money!”\n\nA certain man: “This Shizi has plenty of fertile land, 100 million gold taels ……”\n\nThe little bun turns around. “Mother, do you think that this one is suitable?”>"
