	"description": "Suddenly summoned to another world, the teenage NEET, Houbami Reiji, is asked to fight for the summoner, Tifalycia Cleargreen, in Heroic War as a Hero for her race. Reiji refused outrightly, as it is natural that a NEET would not work. However, Tifalycia is not in a good situation currently, what will Reiji do to overcome the odds as he gets dragged into her situation? And it appears that Reiji is not a simple NEET as he seems on the surface.>"
