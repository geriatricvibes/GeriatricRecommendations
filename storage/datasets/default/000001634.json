	"description": "Su Qiuge transmigrated into a novel and became the villain’s cannon fodder younger sister who was constantly courting disaster.\n\nNot only did her brother dislike her, but she also offended her brother’s sworn enemy, the male lead. \n\nAfter she transmigrated, Su Qiuge decided to curry favor with the male lead so that he would abandon his plans of revenge against her. She wanted to transform her cannon fodder fate and became an obscure passerby in his life instead. \n\nHer plans were going smoothly, until one day she saw the aloof and cold male lead staring at her with a terribly dark gaze full of possessive desire. \n\nSu Qiuge:?? Male lead wake up! I’m the cannon fodder!\n\nLater she realized that the male lead who seemed like a good student was actually black-bellied and full of unspeakable intentions towards her.>"
