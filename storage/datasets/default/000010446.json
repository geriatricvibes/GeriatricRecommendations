	"description": "She tried to save her husband, the emperor, by turning her back on her father, Duke Lauchen, who dreamed of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe result is a failure, and Izaya faces a terrible death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe thought it was all over, but when she opened her eyes again, it was around the coming-of-age ceremony 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nTo protect him, she has to stay away from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'I have to step up and prepare to divorce.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo first of all ... let's use a separate room first!'\r\n\r\nHowever, there was a problem that she couldn't ignore\r\n\r\n'Don't go, I think without you....'\r\n\r\nThat is that her husband can't sleep without Izaya.\r\n\r\n'I have to find a way somehow.'\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n'I'm unable to sleep without you, and you're leaving me? You can't.'\r\n\r\nErn's gesture of wrapping her wrist was very polite and persistent.\r\n\r\n'You made me like this, so you have to take responsibility, Empress.'\r\n\r\nHis voice was friendly and sweet, but his gaze on Izaya was colored with a dark obsession.>"
