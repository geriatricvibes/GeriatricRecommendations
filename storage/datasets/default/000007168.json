	"description": "The story centers around a loner named Takahashi, who is talented in many things except for studying. He shied away from others in high school, and soon was in his second year, still completely alone—until he has a once-in-a-lifetime chance meeting with Satou, a perfect girl in many ways except personality. She asks him to use his talent and help her become the student council president. Now Takahashi finds himself supporting Satou, and is determined to reclaim his school life.>"
