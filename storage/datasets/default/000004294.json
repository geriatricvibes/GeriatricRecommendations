	"description": "He estranged his mother, caused his father to fall into a coma in a car accident, and completely broke off from his excellent relationship. \n\nFu Yuanzhou betrayed his family and became miserable. He realized it too late. But when he woke up one day, he had returned to the past when he was still in high school. At this time, he was still the young and proud Fu family’s young master. \n\nEveryone envies him and everyone loves him. With a chance to start again in life, he is determined that this time he must live well. He will never make the same mistakes, and do his best to compensate his family and friends. \n\nIt’s just… Fu Yuanzhou looked at his ID card suspiciously. \n\nWhat does the word “Omega” on here mean?\n\nLearning what that meant, Fu Yuanzhou’s face was pale, and he banged frantically on the door of his home. Fa Xiaoli happened to open the door, and a breath of Alpha pheromones hit his face, causing Fu Yuanzhou to soften his legs. \n\nAnd…\n\nXiao Jiang held him back, his eyes deep, and he spoke in a low voice. “You came to me in such a hurry, did you finally consider the matter of associating with me?” \n\nFu Yuanzhou: “???” \n\nDoes this bastard know what he is talking about?!\n\nHowever, this is not the end. Fu Yuanzhou belatedly discovered that his childhood friend, his adversary, and the younger brothers who obeyed him were all Alphas, and they all seemed to be interested in him. \n\nEven his former girlfriend has become a male Alpha, and he can easily pick up his princess, which makes him want to die! And the man who pushed him into the abyss, appeared in front of him again this time, and said to him– “Marry me.” \n\nFu Yuanzhou: Get out!>"
