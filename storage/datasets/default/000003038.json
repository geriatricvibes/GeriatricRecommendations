	"description": "During a dinner party at a secluded mountain villa, while the invited guests are engaged in a strange game over an ultra-luxury clock, the owner of the villa, a female writer named Mori Reiko, is met with an unnatural death in her study.\r\n\r\nWith this, the curtain rises on a deadly game of deduction!　\r\n\r\nEmbroiled in the game are Enomoto, a crime prevention consultant (whose main profession is a thief!?), and the lawyer Junko, who tries to solve the mystery of a perfectly locked room protected by the wall of time…\r\n\r\nNote: Wall of time here means alibi.>"
