	"description": "\n\nMany years ago, Kevin, who barely entered the reserve army, was entrusted to look (beat) after (hit) a brat at spring break.\n\nMany years later, Kevin, the Commander of the Bronze Army who ‘just came back to life,’ returned to the royal city, and the person in charge of power had already changed.\n\nHis close friend gloated: “Silly; I heard that you had beaten His Majesty several times when he was still seven-or-eight years old.”\n\nKevin unconcernedly said: “The old account had passed so many years ago. He must have forgotten already.”\n\nOswald: “The person you all admired was a shadow-like childhood existence to me.”\n\nKevin choked on a mouthful of red wine in his throat.\n\nOswald propped up his chin, absent-mindedly said: “But now, the power I held was already above his. How should I retaliate then…?”\n\nKevin: “…”\n\nQ: Long time ago, I had beaten up a brat. The brat became the top boss now. How long could I still live?\n\nA: After a good meal, you could go on your way.>"
