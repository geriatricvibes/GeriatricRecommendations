Inside the bars, he vowed that if he ever had another life, he would be a complete villain! Beast! Scoundrel!\n\nOne day, he actually transmigrated.\n\nSystem: As a villain, you have to be courageous enough to burden the task of initiating trouble, destroying the world and creating chaos. It’s an incredible responsibility, do you understand?\n\nNie Jia: I understand.
