	"description": "In this school, there was a princess. Aikawa Mio was an idol at the school and was also known as the 'Silent Princess' because she never opens her mouth no matter who talks to her. At the time, I didn't have many friends at school, and I was always in the background of my class. On one rainy day, however, the Silent Princess offered me a helping hand...\r\n\r\n'Do you like dogs, Aikawa-san?'\r\n\r\n'Mhn.'\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\n'Wanna eat together?'\r\n\r\n'...mhn!'\r\n\r\nThis is a coming-of-age love story about a school idol who never opens her mouth and a dull man who's always in the background of his class.\r\n>"
