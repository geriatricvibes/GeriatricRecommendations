	"description": "Jing Xian fell in love with Nian Gao at first sight. Since then, he has been thinking about her every day. He wants to see her, hug her and even kiss her.\n\nHowever, before meeting her, he had to learn how to be a normal person.\n\n--\n\nNian Gao likes Jing Xian’s tenderness and consideration. It was not until later that she knew that being tender and considerate was just an illusion. \n\nThat night, he was like a changed man.\nLeaning close to her, he told her, “Do not get close to any man.”>"
