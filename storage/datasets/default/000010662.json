	"description": "It was no doubt that Johann would be the top student at the Academy. Face blessed by God, a warm and friendly personality, and a discerning talent in both sports and academics.\n\nThis position, however, was taken by someone else.\n\n“Miss Elena, congratulations on attaining top seat.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nElena, who didn’t seem to know his name was different.\n\nShe didn’t speak to him, even when most would’ve taken the opportunity to do so.\n\n“Do you have anything more to say?”\n\nJohann’s self-esteem shattered when he realized she didn’t even know who he was.\n\nFrom that moment on, Johann started to observe Elena.>"
