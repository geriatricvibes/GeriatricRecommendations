	"description": "On his first day at school Taiga Makihara falls down a manure pit and almost dies. But he is saved by Konoe R. Chika, the perfect student council president that all the students admire. In that instant Taiga falls in love with her, and begins to work hard to be by her side.\n\nBut afterwards, he discovers that the perfect president is actually a fake creation of five quintuplet sisters with different personalities and abilitiesâ€¦ Does this mean that the girl Taiga Makihara fell in love with does not exist? After this discovery, Taiga pretends not to realize that the five people he loves are pretending to be one, and will make them all his girlfriends.>"
