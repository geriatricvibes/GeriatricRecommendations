	"description": "How did I get reincarnated into a dating game? It was a dating game, so I thought I’d go capture heroines and do “Kya~Kya~ufufu” things, but I was born as a girl. No matter how I think about it, aren’t I on the side of <em>getting</em> captured!? -Fuck that! Despite despairing at my own helplessness, I’ll do my best to improve myself in order to avoid getting captured.>"
