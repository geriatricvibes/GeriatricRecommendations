	"description": "Wen Qiuxing, a straight male bachelor who traveled to the interstellar age, was notified by the empire to pick up his spouse at the civil affairs office within a week. Wen Qiuxing happily went there, he fantasized that he would get paired with a beautiful girl, but he came back with a handsome man who had blue eyes and was 1.9 meters tall! In order to abide by the marriage rules of the empire, the straight male earth man and the alien handsome guy lived intimately together. Immediately afterwards, he learned that his partner was a fine one, and his other identity was that he was the majesty of the empire. The problem was that his partner was dedicated to erase his own royal identity! \r\n\r\nThis is a light read on how the aforementioned beings traveled to the interstellar age and faced various embarrassments. The author's writing is neat and clean, the plot is empty, and the main character’s role is exaggerated. It is a fantasy light novel that was made to make people temporarily forget reality.>"
