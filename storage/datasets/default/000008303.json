	"description": "Olivia Claudel, the despised of the Duchy of Deorc.\r\nThe employees of the mansion gave her the cold shoulder. While the Duke’s adopted son, Kevin Deorc, raped her continuously.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, the Duke’s successor, Leonardo Deorc, returns from the battlefield—\r\nThe man Olivia had a terrible crush on.\r\n\r\nThe joy of reuniting with her crush lasted for a moment.\r\nThat is until Leonard finds out about Olivia’s relationship with Kevin…\r\n\r\n“Is it true that you said you couldn’t live without a man?”\r\n\r\nLeon’s words left her in a deeper abyss.\r\nIt was because no one can prove it even if it is not true…\r\nWill this man believe in her even if she says she’s innocent? She already knew that would never be the case.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“….”\r\n\r\n“Why? Are you going to replace Kevin?”\r\n\r\nAs Olivia’s eyes were about to tear up, Leon’s voice could be heard again.\r\n\r\n“I’m willing to.”\r\n\r\n“What…?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, I’ll satisfy you instead of him. So, don’t do that with my brother anymore.”\r\n\r\nHis face was as serious as it could be.\r\nAlthough her face was filled with confusion, he went out of the room as if he had killed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll come back when the moon tilts west.”\r\n\r\n>"
