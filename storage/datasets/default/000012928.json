	"description": "Status. That was the magic display in which you would understand with a single glance, the talents bestowed upon you by god. Your skills and stats.\n\nIn such a world which heavily values such a display, our protagonist Raigh, is the only one without a display, that not even he, nor anyone else was able to understand.\n\nRaigh, unknown to the skills and stats that he holds, was scorned by his surroundings at a young age, unable to find an honest job, and was living out his hopeless days as a bottom-of-the-barrel adventurer. Nevertheless, he was trying his utmost in order to fulfill his dreams, and had gotten his hands on a ridiculous power without even noticing it.>"
