	"description": "In every book, there’s always a female cannon fodder who seeks death – the ones who are arrogant and tyrannical, spoiled and willful, and the ones who are abused till half-dead by the male protagonist. \n\nAfter Huo Wei transmigrated and became a female cannon fodder things were different than expected! \n\nScum’s dad favored and fell in love with his daughter? Why don’t you just be a couple instead!\n\nThe Chairman became a dog who doesn’t care for personnel matters? I’ll send you to Tokow* to further broaden your knowledge!\n\nThe fake daughter is detested? See you! You can’t climb up the social ladders!\n\n*Note: old name for Kaohsiung in Taiwan>"
