But we’re still friends, right?”\nThe heroine had an affair with my fiance.\n\nYeah, go ahead and take that tr*sh.\n\n“Would you like to have a relationship with someone who had an affair with my fiance, Your Highness?”\nCause I decided to have the Male Lead.\n\nSince I’ve broken up my engagement, then I can start getting the Male Lead after getting out of the original story and decided to enjoy a happy life.\n\nAfter a while, rumors have spread that I was the Crown’s Prince lover and was raking in money. And there’s also another news that the two had broken up.\n\n“Ciel, I was wrong. Can we still be friends?”\n“Ciel… I was foolish. You are the only one that I love. You love me too, right? So let’s start over.”\n\nWhat? Are they both out of their mind? Throwing their hands away, I raised the corners of my lips.\n“Don’t make me laugh. So get out of here.”>"
