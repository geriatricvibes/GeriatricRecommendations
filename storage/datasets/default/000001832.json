	"description": "Marquess Lysette was robbed of her saintly power as well as her fiance by her sister.\n\nShe has also been stripped of her title for a crime she did not commit, and she is now abandoned in the dungeon.\n\nIt was practically a death sentence, but with the initial skill【Noble-Bloodline】, the skill points she gained were tripled, and she was able to solo through the dungeon quickly and easily with the skills 【Total-Attack Magic】 and 【Preemptive-Action】.\n\nBut the food problem stood in Lysette’s way.\n\n“… I wonder if monsters can be eaten… H-How delicious! Alright! From now on, I’ll just enjoy the dungeon’s blessings!”\n\nLysette loves her life in the dungeon, where she cooks monster dishes for the adventurers she meets.\n\nMeanwhile, her sister, Saint, was experiencing a mysterious weakening of her powers.>"
