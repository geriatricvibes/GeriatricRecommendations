	"description": "Lin Jing, a junior high school student, had been a vampire for more than a thousand years. One day on the way home, she saw a young woman laying on the ground struggling in death, and her merciful heart took her there to make the young woman the same kind of monster as she was. But the young woman did not obey her order of taking pity on the common people. She killed people cruelly in a small village, which brought Jing trouble. Meanwhile, another old lady vampire followed Jing as her shade, with the purpose of covering for Jing. Jing was always in a low mood because of loneliness. But her depression may be healed by a boy who suddenly comes into her life, her close friend Xiaoya’s brother, a boy who feels like a friend at first sight.>"
