	"description": "When I reincarnated, I became a pig!  As long I get to be taken care of by a cute girl, this kind of adventure doesn’t sound bad at all.\n\nI’m an ordinary otaku that lost consciousness after eating raw pig liver.  When I thought I was reincarnated into another world, I found out I was just a pig!\n\nJess is a girl who can read people’s minds, and she helped me when I was stuck inside a pigpen.\n\nOink!  Cute!  From a pig’s perspective, underneath her skirt hem I was able to catch a glance of white…\n\n“Um, I can hear your thoughts…”\n\nOh crap!  My desires are being exposed!\n\n“If you so desire, just a little bit is okay.”\n\nEh, what…?!\n\nA life where an innocent girl takes care of me and accepts (albeit a bit taken aback) my beast-like desires.  Yeah, it’s not so bad being a pig.\n\nThis was supposed to be our oink-oink-like adventure, but…  Hey Jess, why is your life being targeted?\n\nNow, this pig with no magic or skills must use his knowledge, wits, and sense of smell to save this girl from her cruel fate!>"
