His daughter Jin-Hee said while eating the devastating food made by her father.\n\n“To be exact, I was the commander of the Imperial Capital Defense Knights,\n\nI was named Bazette, and I was poisoned and killed by my younger brother the day I became the head of the household.\n\nBut I just remembered that.”\n\n“Uh-Huh••••••.”\n\nJin-Hee habitually rubbed her dry eyes. Then she put the spoon down and said.\n\n“So from now on, I’m going to forget my previous job as a Knight(past life) and try to make some money as a Hunter instead.\n\nOh, and this dinner is the worst. I don’t think you should put pork belly and bracken in fish cake soup.”\n\n“••••••Don’t you think it’s the same a healthy food?”\n\n“You’ll get sick from eating this.”\n\n***\n\nGateways emerged in various parts of the world due to the twisting of the orbit, and monsters from another world appeared.\n\nHumans who could use mana became superhumans,\n\nThe country gave these superhumans the task to close the gate or to keep the peace on Earth.\n\nHunters.\n\nA being that hunts monsters in this world.\n\nThe story of Jin-Hee, a former knight and now a hunter begins.>"
