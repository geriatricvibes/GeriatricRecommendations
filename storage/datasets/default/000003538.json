	"description": "Fang Qingci, a reclusive writer on the earth, once transmigrated and became a super rare male of the interstellar zerg race.\n\nWell, what? There is no such thing as romance novels here? Let me show you the light!\n\nSo he regained his old profession and started to write a few drama filled novels.\n\nThe females shouted that such affectionate males could not exist, but they kept rewarding honestly.\n\nAs he wrote, Fang Qingci became a well-known great writer in the interstellar universe.\n\nWith a career, love is also essential.\n\nThe major general next door knelt down on his knees, offered all his wealth and a sincere heart, and only asked for the position of a servant.\n\nOf course, I’ll take everything you have and stay with you forever!>"
