	"description": "It was a beautiful beginning.\r\n\r\nShe was a precious princess who was treasured by her father. Her life should have been filled with beauty, without winter, only sunshine.\r\n\r\nShe just had to meet him.\r\n\r\nAs she was dozing off, wrapped in a bundle of blankets on her father’s lap in court,\r\n\r\nHe was kneeling below, with a pale complexion and picturesque eyes. A small red mark was imprinted between his brows, akin to a red-crowned crane - alluring and highly venomous.\r\n\r\nHe was a prince from the enemy land being held hostage, possessing an uncertain future\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was the princess, with royal blood running in her veins.\r\n\r\nHence, she became a legend passed down in folksongs on the apricot path: To give her life to the one she loves. Even if there came a day of heartless abandonment, there would be no regrets.   \r\n\r\nBut, in this story, there was another person.\r\n\r\nAt her lowest points, he said to her, I will take you away, to the ends of the earth, not leaving, not forsaking – But, unfortunately, he wasn’t the same young man from the very start.\r\n\r\nTill the end, when everything that flourished receded, she realised. Alas, all her former hate and pain was nothing but a lie.\r\n\r\nHer one lifetime was the most magnificent beauty. After which, simply reduced to ash. >"
