	"description": "Before hanging, she became a villainess in a devastated novel where her life was supposed to end after being poisoned.\r\nHowever, what happened was that she couldn’t die of poison.\r\nWhat’s even more surprising was that she could tell the taste of the poison!\r\n\r\n“I can tell the taste of poison.”\r\n“Really?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“What kind of use is that?”\r\n\r\nOh my. This evil woman’s past was too formidable to survive with tricks.\r\nSo she took out the secret card.\r\n\r\n“Your boss will be poisoned.”\r\n\r\nThat’s right, it’s something about the villain that I know!\r\n\r\n“I can be your poison dectector.”\r\n\r\nSo I thought I could survive well as an employee of a general store in front of the villain…\r\nMy boss, who I thought was just an extra in the black valley, was ranked number one?\r\nIt was an out-dated story that was popular before…\r\n\r\n“…It’s not cliche, indeed.”\r\n\r\nYou’re scared of poison?\r\nI’ll eat it for you!>"
