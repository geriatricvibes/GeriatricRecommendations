	"description": "Ye Wan transmigrated into a dog blood novel into a female partner with the same name and surname as her. Naturally, the female partner ending was tragic.\n\nThe system told her that she could only live if she was full of the protagonist's favor, otherwise she would be in danger of death at any time.\n\nYe Wan wondered: So do I attack the male lead?\n\nSystem: What are you thinking? You stupid melon seed brain! Marry Bai Fumei! White, rich and beautiful! You listen to me! I'm asking you to be with the heroine!\n\nYe Wan: ? ? ?\n\nOkay, in order to survive, Ye Wan decided to give it a try.\n\nYe Wan: If you don't like me, I will die.\n\nShen Yu: Are you threatening me to be with you with suicide?\n\nYe Wan: I'm not, don't get me wrong!!!\n\nIn the beginning...\nYe Wan: I'm straight.\nShen Yu: Who isn't?\n\nLater...\nYe Wan: I'm straight.\nShen Yu: Oh.\n\nLast...\nYe Wan: I'm straight.\nShen Yu: No, you're not.\n\nEnd...\nYe Wan: Ok baby, I love you.
