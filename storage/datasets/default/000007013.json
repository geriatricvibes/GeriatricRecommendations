	"description": "In a novel I happened to read, I possessed Empress Etricia, the Villainess. Is that also possessed during childbirth? After a terrible pain, I came to my senses and found a child in my arms.\r\n\r\n“Etricia did a great job. But I’d like to ask you one question. Who is the father of the child?”\r\n\r\n“…..The father of the child?”\r\n\r\nYou’re right. So who’s the child’s father? No, I mean, am I having a baby now?!\r\n\r\n“Who is the father of the child?”\r\n\r\nI don’t even know who my husband is. It’s not something I did!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“I brought Rustina to this place to make it known to everyone.”\r\n\r\nMy father looked at me and Rustina and immediately made an offer that surprised everyone.\r\n\r\n“If I find Rustina’s father, I will make him my son-in-law. However, my successor will be Etricia.”\r\n\r\nAt those words, everyone opened their mouths. It seemed to be the same for me and Rustina. Rustina looked at my father and blinked her eyes.\r\n\r\n‘…..What did I just hear?’\r\n\r\nI think you’re going to give me the right of succession now. You don’t have to! I was just going to leave once I found the child’s father.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Her Father?”>"
