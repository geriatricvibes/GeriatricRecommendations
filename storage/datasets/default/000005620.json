	"description": "A labyrinth that swallowed up humanity and four options are given to them. Easy mode for anyone to live on. Normal mode, where only the living survived. Hard mode in which only 1% can survive. And Alone mode, where only one survived. Kang Tae-san was an Easy Mode player but is the strongest on mankind. The words that he had heard several times. “What if you had chosen hard mode or at least normal mode?” When I was dying I was regretting my own choice, someday you had a chance to choose gold again. “I won’t make the wrong choice this time.”>"
