Having learned his secret, the mysterious individual compelled her classmate into living together and made an astonishing proposal: to get revenge on the two instigators. At first, Idzono was reluctant, but then slowly starts to agree with Minato’s methods. After befriending Haru, another victim of bullying, they start to raise a mutiny.>"
