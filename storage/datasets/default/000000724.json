	"description": "After three days of working nonstop, Cheng Zhaoci has transmigrated (read: had a stroke) as is everyone’s wish.\n\nWhat does it feel like to transmigrate into a male, the rarer s*x of the insectoid race?\n\nCheng Zhaoci would reply, ‘yeah never mind that, there is still work that is my job to do.’\n\nOne day, the internet of the insectoids that had a sore lack of entertainment media suddenly featured a new account that had short serial comics. The comics had sweet love, passionate fighting, and all sorts of imaginative stories. Many fans flock to follow this account. Of course, many shemales were sceptical of the 1-to-1 monogamous love depicted in those comics.\n\nLater, when Wing Commander Wei Zhuo was deep behind enemy lines, his xiongzhu, the Wing Commander Cheng Zhaoci came to rescue him without hesitation. That is when the shemales realised – there certainly can be sweet, sweet, love. It just doesn’t belong to them.\n\nThe shemales only want to smile and wave them away.>"
