	"description": "When God left and refused to intervene with human affairs, he left a prophecy of the end of the world.\n\n“When the time of magic draws to a close, the world will collapse and everything will fall into chaos.”\n\nMan created a civilization so advanced because of their wisdom but they were doomed to be cursed. After all, intelligence is a gift and a curse.\n\nThen a virus came like a thief in the night and brought an outbreak, an apocalypse. This advent brought an era of lawlessness, decay of morality, and a world struck by a pandemic.\n\nWhen everyone is left to fend for themselves, be prepared to die.>"
