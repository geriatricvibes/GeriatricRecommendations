	"description": "         There are two worlds just like the two sides of a coin. On one side, an Astrologer’s Apprentice, Jonah, was saddled with the prediction of Segnise, so he wandered all over the world to find the truth.\n         On the other side, a revolutionary named Gu Tie rushed into the quantum computer network. When the two souls are gradually getting close to each other, the secret, which was buried under the core of the quantum computer, will eventually reveal itself. By that time, a ‘change’ awaits the world.>"
