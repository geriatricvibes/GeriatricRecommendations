	"description": "When I woke up, I couldn’t recall anything.\r\n\r\nApparently, I was the ‘Peerless Saint’, and although I had immense power, it was presently sealed. That barely mattered though…\r\n\r\n“…My husband is too awesome…!?”\r\n\r\nBefore I lost my memory, I was a villain who had abused her power as the strongest saint to cause misdeeds. Oswald, a genius magician, said that we were married solely because he was the only one who could kill me. Thus, he was keeping an eye on me.\r\n\r\n“Then, if I were to help you, would you date me, Oswald?”\r\n\r\n“Hmm, if you truly could, I’ll hold your hand and we can go on a date—I get it, stay back, don’t hug me!!”\r\n\r\nI could no longer use my divine power as the saint and everyone around me despised me. Above all, my newly-married husband loathed me…\r\n\r\nI’m such a bad wife. For now, let’s keep the fact that I’ve lost my memory a secret.\r\n\r\nAs compensation for my past evil deeds, I’d like to help my beloved husband as much as possible.\r\n\r\n…But I feel like I can still use divine power that should have been sealed for some reason?>"
