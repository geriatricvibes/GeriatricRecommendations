	"description": "Lin Qin was a low-key new film Emperor who didn’t even go to receive his award at the Cannes Film Festival. \n\nRecently, he accepted a love reality show, just because his partner would be the male god – Meng Chao.\n\nMeng Chao was a legend in the entertainment circle, he went to the pinnacle of his career right on his debut and was a tall, elegant and aloof male god in the eyes of fans.\n\nFor some reason, he accepted to participate in a love-reality show. \n\nThe moment he saw his partner, Meng Chao only felt his heart that had been silent for more than two decades, moved…..\n\nThe last recording (of the reality show) was by live broadcast and was at Meng Chao’s home.\n\nThe camera aimed at the movie emperor’s big bed, where Lin Qin sat up from the bed, staring blearily, as he softly called “husband” at the movie emperor.>"
