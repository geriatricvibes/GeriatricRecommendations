	"description": "In a world where life was determined by the [JOB] given by the goddess, Ain, a 15-year-old boy (the main character), was an [Appraiser]. He had no ability other than appraising things.\n\nOne day, in a dungeon, he was attacked by a horde of monsters due to his party member’s fault. Ain, who was left alone, falls into the abyss.\n\nThere, Ain met the spirit of a special tree, the World Tree, which grow deep underground, and the sage who protected it.\n\nWith their help, Ain’s appraisal skill had evolved. He obtained a [God’s Eye] that could see through everything.\n\nUsing it, he could clearly see all the movements and weak points of his opponents. He could even copy the attacks and magics his opponents used just by observing.\n\nAcquiring the power, Ain managed to escape from the dungeon and lived a second life.>"
