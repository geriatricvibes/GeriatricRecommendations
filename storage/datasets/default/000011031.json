	"description": "The Walter Prison is a prison that has been known as 'The Hell.'\r\nElma, a young girl, born of a prostitute, was raised by prisoners and was released from the prison from a pardoned state when King Luden, the great king, died.\r\nElma is then made into a maid of honor at the order of the Second Prince Lucas, who issues the order for her release. She follows her mother's advice and starts to live her life as a 'normal' girl, but she always ends up doing something outrageous.\r\nShe has the beauty of a prostitute, the mind-reading skills of a swindler, the fighting skills of a mad warrior, and the medical skills of a mad scientist - all of which her 'family' of prisoners had taught her that is a rather 'normal.'\r\n\r\nHer unconventional abilities and actions soon caused an uproar in the entire royal palace...?\r\n\r\n'Perhaps...the people from the unbound world, can't do that much? (With a straight face) '\r\n\r\nIt's a remarkable story of a young girl who aims to be 'normal' in the unbound world.>"
