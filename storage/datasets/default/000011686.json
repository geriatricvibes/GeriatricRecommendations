	"description": "I found myself on a hospital bed. My boyfriend, Adachi Yukiya, was looking at me with concern. I would do anything for him, right? I suddenly thought about it. I thought I'd be the one to make him happy. But now, I realize it was such a ridiculous wish.\r\n\r\n“Let’s break up.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes widened even more at my words, and the tears that he could no longer hold back spilled from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why…?”\r\n\r\nA faint, almost muffled voice asked me what I really meant. Even without asking me that, you should already know what I mean, right? I clenched my fists tightly in frustration and disappointment.\r\n\r\n'I can't protect you anymore.'\r\n\r\nAs an Omega, I can't make you happy. There is no guarantee that I will be able to help you when the time comes.\r\n\r\nYou knew that all along, didn’t you? Still, I foolishly believed that I could do anything with just these 'feelings' until today.>"
