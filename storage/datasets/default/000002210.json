Having been brought up in a military, political, and business family, he was decisive in dealing with businesses, yet sexually continent as it was said. Nevertheless, he happened to fall in love with an illegitimate daughter.\r\n\r\nThe disgraceful illegitimate daughter had been detested by her whole family, but suddenly won the love of the young master of the Huo Family.\r\n\r\nSince then, he turned into a 'slave' of his wife and pampered her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Huo: 'They say I am an illegitimate daughter, and totally out of your league.'\r\n\r\nMaster Huo: 'Who has such a big mouth!
