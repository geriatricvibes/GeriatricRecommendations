	"description": "Alioth Riel, who was living a peaceful life as the daughter of a Marquis who organized a private army by a merchant. (A merchant organization who protects the market)\n\nOne day, I rescued a poor handsome man who had collapsed on the street. That man was Cassiar Kissen, a notorious villain who ruined the lives of both the heroine and male lead in the novels I had read.\n\nFurthermore, only the Heroine possessed the power to put the villain to sleep. Like he did to the Heroine in the original story, the villain began to obsess over me. At this rate, I was worried that I would end up with a ruined ending, so I set out to find the Heroine.\n\n“It seems that you did not receive the obituary.”\n\n“An obituary? Whose…”\n\nWhen I looked into the red and bloodshot eyes of the Count, the Heroine’s father, I got a shiver down my spine and had a bad hunch.\n\n“She is dead. My daughter is already dead.”\n\nThe Heroine in the novel died. And she had given me her power in exchange for a ruined ending.>"
