	"description": "It's a game of death once you've logged in. While the other players around him cry, Karma starts to capture the game – because he can’t die!\n\nAs a result of his reputation/title and playing style,  Karma receives a damage withstanding body!\n\nBefore anyone knew this, Immortal and the Guild, members that surround him – and a slime – becomes one of the select few Guilds in the game that push the capture forward.  \n\n※ Karma is basically a solo player.\n\n※ I said it many times but even if the surroundings are life- threatening there is hardly any danger to him.>"
