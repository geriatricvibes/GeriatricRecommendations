Watch her now as she concoct pills, refine artifacts, govern treasures, crush white lotuses, and tame beasts.\n\nShe points her sword to the heavens with pride.\n\nYet unexpectedly she falls into the hands of a certain two-faced cold prince.\n\nWhen she was eaten again and again, Feng Xing Ying bellows “GET LOST!”\n\nHe hooks his finger: “Darling, I’m ready to get lost in these sheets whenever you want.”>"
