	"description": "Everyone rumored that Z country's young master Jun was cold-blooded, decisive, and not close to the female gender, but he took in an illiterate little girl as the pearl in the palm of his hand. \r\n\r\nHowever, the little girl brought her case to the table. An illusion, it was all an illusion. What not close to the female gender? Which animal was crushing her every night? \r\n\r\n'Baby, let me love you.' The man undressed her with his lips. She retreated pitifully, 'Don't want, don't want, you're bad.'\r\n\r\n'Women love bad guys.' After eating he turned around to wipe his lips. She kneaded her pitiful little waist, tears falling, 'This one is not a woman, she's just a little mermaid.'>"
