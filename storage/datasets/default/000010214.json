I rescued the patriarch of the villain family, the former duke, and the heir one after another. \n\nBut the villains are acting weird. \n\n“Lili, do you want me to buy you the Imperial Palace?”\n\n“Liarte, Grandpa brought some candy.” \n\n“I told you this, you’re the only one for me.” \n\nSomehow everyone seems to be tamed, maybe it’s a mistake…….?>"
