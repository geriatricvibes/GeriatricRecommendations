	"description": "I was reading web novels at home when suddenly I realized that I was standing fully naked in an unknown forest \n\nMoreover, I had turned into a blonde-haired, blue-eyed young elf girl! What’s the meaning of this?! However, not only did there come no answer, I don’t even remember who I was! \n\nI have no important memories of my previous life! Neither do I have the cheat power seen frequently during reincarnation!\n\nWhat I have is my appetite, curiosity and ability to go naturally with the flow of events.>"
