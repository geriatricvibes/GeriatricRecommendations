In an outburst of anger because of the failed quest, the party informed him of his expulsion.\n\n……However, the party members realized something little by little once Raust left the party.\n\n——— Raust’s ability who was training himself had put him in the realm of the top class among adventurers. It was because Raust was in their party that the party was called first-class.\n\nThis is a story of an oppressed healer who was banished from the worst party and then met people who acknowledge him.>"
