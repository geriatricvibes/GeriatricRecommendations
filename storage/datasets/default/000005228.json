I am Beta.\r\n\r\nWhile working for the company, I had a realization.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer in this society where Alphas and Omegas love and hate one other.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that all of the Alpha executives, as well as the incredibly cute Omega employees, disappear.\r\n\r\nAll I need is retirement and a trip to Hawaii, not a relationship.\r\n\r\nI do not allow any romance in my area.\r\n\r\nIt was a declaration of an exclusive dating restriction zone.>"
