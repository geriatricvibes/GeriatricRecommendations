	"description": " I’m Yukito Kokonoe, and I’m the one who had the worst luck with women. My mother abandoned me, my sister hated me, and my childhood friend, who I thought she had feelings for me, rejected me before I could tell her, and then lied to me when I was heartbroken. As a result, I found myself completely emotionally broken, and it was too late to do anything about it. But that was strange. For some reason, I feel like the women who traumatized me are glancing at me. Yeah, I must be imagining it!\r\n\r\nThis is a love comedy about a boy who has been hurt too much and too late, and the women who have hurt him, in a misunderstanding that starts too late and never starts at all. “Love?　What’s that, can I eat it?”\r\n>"
