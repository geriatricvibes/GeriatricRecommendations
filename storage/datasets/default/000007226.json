	"description": "After retiring from the military, Qin Ge was diagnosed with PTSD. Despite being able to recover with the help of psychotherapy, he was still a little more aggressive than ordinary people.\r\n\r\n'Didn’t you mention a marriage of convenience? I’ll go with her then.' Qin Ge pointed casually.\r\n\r\n'I’m just a bystander,' Wu Tong said innocently.\r\n\r\n'Though your husband has gone through treatment, there are still some lingering aftereffects, such as impulsiveness, aggression, and a strong desire for control. In other words,' the psychiatrist concluded, 'you need to pamper him. Every day.'\r\n\r\n'Understood!' Wu Tong promised while feeling as if her soul had left her body.>"
