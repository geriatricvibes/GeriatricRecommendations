	"description": "As a person who transmigrated into a novel written by himself, Qin Kaiyi experiences a huge pressure and burden.\n\nEven more so, he transmigrated as the villain and is forced to follow the plot. Qin Kaiyi expresses that he doesn’t want to write novels anymore.\n\nQin Kaiyi: “WTF. transmigrating into the villain and being forced to follow the plot. Just let it be. Shen Feixiao, can you get the f*ck down from my body???”\n\nShen Feixiao: “Shixiong, I won’t.”\n\nAlright, actually this is just a s*upid story about transmigrating into his own novel as the villain and getting pushed down by his own protagonist.>"
