	"description": "Chosen by the system, every time JingLing completed a task, the pile of scumbag men who hated her would grow. Eventually the accumulation of hatred led to an accident, causing her to be reborn into the 17 year old body of an alternate timeline version of herself.\n\nIn this world, although her gender had changed from female to male, the skills she had gained from the system stayed.\n\n----\n\nThe face reflected in the mirror was handsome enough to cause the downfall of nations. An arrogant smirk appeared on JingLing’s face.\n\nDon’t worry boys! I won’t play with you anymore, instead I’ll play with your girlfriends. You and your right hand will have a long relationship.\n>"
