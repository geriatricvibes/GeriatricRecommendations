	"description": "A supreme existence dies as he fails at his attempt at ascending. Reborn into the modern world from whence he came, once again treading on the path of cultivation, aiming to be above all beings.\r\n\r\n“Even if the path before me is filled with thistles and thorns, I shall cut my way through no matter what!”\r\n\r\n“Even if an army ten thousand strong, akin to a mountain, blocks my path, with my sword, I shall slaughter my way through!”\r\n\r\n“I shall never back down!”>"
