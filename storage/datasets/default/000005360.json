	"description": "The world is full of mysteries. Strange, seemingly unexplainable events occur more often than we may realize. A young boy may catch an illness no doctor can explain. An office may catch fire for no apparent reason. And perhaps, someone may die a sudden and unexpected death - their bodies blighted beyond recognition.\n\nSome might believe that these events are merely freak accidents.\n\nHowever, Ye Shaoyang knows otherwise.\n\nThe youngest inner disciple ever in the prestigious Daoist Maoshan Sect. Talented, handsome, and a hillbilly from the mountains who still uses a brick phone in the modern age.\n\nFollow the tale of our quirky, snippy, but honorable hero, after he finally descends the mountains after fifteen years of being out of touch with normal society. Read on as he combats horrifying apparitions, charms ladies, and finds himself in all sorts of trouble along the way!\n\nA story that delves into Daoism, Chinese sorcery, and the supernatural from Asian mythology.>"
