	"description": "On a certain day, Yu Qingyu was walking down the street when an egg suddenly dropped down from the sky and hit his head. Since then, he has been bound to an animal counterattack system. He travels to thousands of worlds to change the fates of a variety of animals.\n\nA certain dragon god smiles: “Little rabbit, where are you running off to?”\n\nA panda breaks off some bamboo: “I’ll let you eat it. Don’t be sad!”\n\nThe Snake King spits out its core: “I’ll never eat mice again, okay?”\n\nYu Qingyu can’t understand. Why do all of his counterattack tasks end up with him being pressed down? Sure enough, the system is unreliable.>"
