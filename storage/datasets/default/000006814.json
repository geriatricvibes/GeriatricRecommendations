	"description": "When Kiryu Ryuto travels through, he finds that his identity is actually the villain master in the love game.\n\nVery coincidentally, he is carrying out a very promising job, kidnapping the heroine.\n\nMore coincidentally, the heroine’s bodyguards are coming here, ready to throw him into Tokyo Bay to be fed to the fish.\n\nWait, is this really the world of a love game? Why am I being thrown to feed the fish as soon as I crossed over?\n\nThe world is hot and cold, people’s hearts are sinister, and only many beautiful girls can make people feel a touch of warmth\n\n– BY. Master of Death. Kiryu Ryuto>"
