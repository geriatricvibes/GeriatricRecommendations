	"description": "I got a present.\n\n[‘RANDOM (SSS)–God’s Gift’ has arrived.]\nNot only that, but from god…\n\n___\n\nIt’s something I remember thinking a long time ago as a young kid.\n\nWouldn’t it be awesome if I could wake up to a present in my hands every morning as if Santa had been by on Christmas eve?\n\nThen, on December 2033…\n\n“The hell is this?”\n\nThe present in my hands I woke up to in my rented single-room apartment, shivering from trying to save on heating fees, was not from Santa but from God.>"
