	"description": "His will is tough and he is unwilling to be normal. However, his pathway was destined to be that way, being born in a small sect’s branch.\n\nHowever, one day, his left eye merges with the eye of an Ancient God in an accident. From that moment on, he turns from a fish into a dragon.\n\nHe rises up like a star, walking the path of a legendary cultivator.\n\nFrom being a tiny, small ant at the bottom of the world, he rises step by step, into a place full of powerful sects, strong ancient clans and countless geniuses.\n\nThis is an era of legends.>"
