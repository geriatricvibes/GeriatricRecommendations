	"description": "Here, the aerial city 《Arcane Garden》, is the only place in the world that the hero could save from the ruins. The existing 「Ground」, the world of living things, has only darkness and pollution, and that is starting to expand to the heavenly ocean. \r\n\r\nA group of adventurers join an airship to begin their journey to defeat the magic left by the Evil Spirit that started it all ― and they are: Gray Ackster, a magician. When he went to the cleaning request that was issued by the 《Guide Academy》, he met the girl, Syria, along the girls’ spirits group. “I’m Syria!”, “I knooow, I’m thriiiving!”. \r\n\r\nIn his day-to-day, the adventurer even being immature, could do some works. On a simple day, when he went to a vigilance call, he finds out that what the hero destroyed was a false god that served the Evil Spirit. \r\n\r\nWill they be able to stop the Evil from reaching the 《Center of the Darkness》 and obtain the 《Black Shard》?>"
