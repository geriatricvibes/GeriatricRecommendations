	"description": "He broke the closed-mouth meditation and destroyed the indestructible body by breaking from the monastic abstinence.\n\nHowever, I am bent on stealing the Three Volumes of Buddha’s Treasures that he kept, and then walk away, leaving him burdened with an undeserved crime.\n\nPei Wuji, you say, how can I be so evil?\n\nShen Du asked. \n\nClearly, sorrowful words are spoken, but his expression is ruthless and indifferent, as if the monk had never enticed him at Tianji Temple. \n\nTherefore, Pei Wuji felt as if his heart had been gouged out. \n\nHe responded as follows: You are the master of demonic cultivation, you crush all demons beneath your feet, you are a cruel Shen Du—you ought to be this horrible.>"
