	"description": "I became the daughter of the heroine in the novel I read in my previous life. The original story was over, and I was living a happy life with the buff of having the female lead as my mother.\n\n“Velsia. I’m the only one who will love everything about you.”\n\nThe son of the villainess who suffered from madness.\n\nEmil Callixst, an innocent child isolated because of the villainess’ sins. He, who inherited the madness of her mother, annihilated my family and when I died, I returned to the age of ten.\n\nI tried to cure Emil’s madness to avoid death but…\n\n“You’re the only one who saw me as me.”\n\n“…Emil, wait a minute.”\n\n“You’re the only one who reached out to me.”\n\nBut the boy I knew grew up better than anyone else.\n\n“So you’re the only one who should be by my side.”\n\nContrary to my intentions, he ended up obsessing over me.\n\n“I… I want you to keep pitying me.”\n\nThe child who grew up a lot now became a man and tried to hold onto me.>"
