	"description": "At the tip of the man’s sword, the corner of the glass tank, where not a speck of light had penetrated, cracked with a sound.\n\nDark hair and dark eyebrows like the jet-black sea.  Underneath, golden eyes shaped like the full moon stared slowly at the mermaid.\n\n“Take it out. Alive.”\n He saved her from the darkness.\n\n “Melusine. That is your name from now on.”\n The man gave her a name.\n\n She could watch him all night, every day and never get tired of it.\n\n “It’s good…”\n It’s as if ripples were tickling around her lips. It felt like it was flowing down her heart.\n\nThe woman had a hunch.  She finally met her long-awaited serendipity, her destiny. >"
