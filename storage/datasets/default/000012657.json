	"description": "In the imperial garden of jade tiles and red walls, the flowers have bloomed. A childish girl shyly confessed, “Jingxuan gege, I like you.”\n\nJingxuan indifferently retorted, “But I don’t like you!”\n\nYears later, when they met again, the immature girl has become an elegant lady. He said to her affectionately this time, “Your husband will only be me, and I will not fail again.”\n\nShe stared at him with tears in her eyes and said, “You should have understood that I have already lost the courage to love you.”\n\nHer affection had been so deep, yet he missed it in full bloom. Now that he’s persistent, she has already grown cold.\n\nOne step forward, two steps back. They are two people who never meet in between— they always miss each other.>"
