	"description": "Carlyle’s family has always been in control of things, especially marriage and love. One day Carlyle has diagnosed an insensitive person. Carlyle was told to have s*x with anyone but Omega. He was then introduced to Ash Jones. Surprisingly, Carlyle and Ash had kissed each other 6 years before on New Year’s Eve.\n\n“I’m doing this because of Nick’s request. You don’t have to worry, I won’t fall for someone like you, anyway.”\n\nAsh obviously can’t remember Carlyle. Ash seems to have someone he can’t forget. At the place where they met each other officially, Carlyle made Ash angry with his statement. Even though Carlyle is sure of himself that he won’t like Ash, he starts to give his heart to Ash eventually.\n\nWhilst to Ash, Carlyle is just his s*x partner.>"
