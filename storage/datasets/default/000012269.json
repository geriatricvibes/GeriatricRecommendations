	"description": "“Honey, be good...Give me your phone…”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” The internet-addict girl clutched onto her phone, determined not to give him.\r\n\r\nThe handsome and noble man slightly sighed. He lowered his body to hug the girl.\r\n\r\n“You’re not listening again, hm?” She immediately handed her phone over cowardly as he said so in a clear and distinct voice.\r\n\r\nHe was the eminent and noble Master Li, a powerful figure in the business world.\r\n\r\nShe was just from a normal family that suffered from her stepmother’s schemes, a pitiful girl.\r\n\r\nAn accident made him appear in her world.\r\n\r\nSince then, everyone in S City knew that Master Li had a treasure and cherished her dearly. He feared that she might be wronged in the tiniest bit. He will personally tutor her in her studies, personally be her training partner in video games, and even reserve the movie theaters for her movies.>"
