	"description": "Li Zheng, a former Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory researcher, professor at Huaqing University, and head of the National Drug Research Laboratory, died suddenly after staying up all night and woke up to find himself back in a small fishing village in 1982.\n\nHis father had disappeared and his mother had run away from home, leaving his cheap half-sister to take care of him.\n\nFaced with this HARD mode of life, Li Zheng revealed a standard smile.\n\nNo fear, no gold finger could compare to my almost Nobel Prize winning head.>"
