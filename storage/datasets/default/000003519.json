	"description": "The “Dog Emperor” gets adopted by his fake “Favored Consort.” This story follows their story as they experience all sorts of trials in the imperial harem and find true love.\n\nThe dog king will recover his human body.\n\nThis is not a legitimate harem drama novel – there will be love, there will be pampering.\n\nEnormous silver platters, shocking melodramas, all part of the package.\n\nLooking at his own concubines and imperial offspring from a doggy’s perspective:\n\nWho used to be the sweet, gentle, and eloquent flower turns out to be a venus fly trap behind the scenes.\n\nWho used to be the filial and courteous, intelligent and adorable, imperial princes and princesses transform into demons in a flash.\n\nThe progression (of the story) overturns understandings and unmasks countless illusions.\n\nBut by the protection of the gods, the dog emperor met a healing owner. Although the path is rough, the end is pleasant.>"
