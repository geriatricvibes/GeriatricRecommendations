	"description": "He was treated harshly by his environment, and no one was ever nice to him. But as long as there was such a person, a corner of the curtain would be opened for the person in the cage. Then, a person like him would also find the light. This was an animal’s instinct, a desire to survive.\r\n\r\nSu Beimo was a beam of light, opening the door of the ‘prison’.\r\n\r\nIt was him who saved Liao Nanqing, who had been living with an inferiority complex.>"
