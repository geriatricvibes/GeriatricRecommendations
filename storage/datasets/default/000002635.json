	"description": "Just one step in the wrong direction, and I managed to cross over into a different sphere. A newly-made world of a God.\r\n\r\nIn the distance stood a small house surrounded by a field. And inside lay a man on a bed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the God, he was a hero. One who had died in a tragic event.\r\n\r\nThen the next words of the God threw me into a panic.\r\n\r\nWhat did you mean I needed to save money to return to my original world?\r\n\r\nSince there was nothing else I could do anyway, I dove head first into my goal. Plucked some grass. Grew some vegetables. All to earn a steady income.\r\n\r\nApparently, my profession was the “Hero’s Wife,” but that’s definitely a bug, right?>"
