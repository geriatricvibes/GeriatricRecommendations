Destroying world landmarks, historical buildings and nature, they easily collapsed human civilization.\r\n\r\nWithin these dungeons, monsters emerged--flooding out from within, overrunning humanity, scattering many lives. The human population was reduced by a large amount almost instantly. However, when it seemed like the entire race was going to be eaten--humans awakened with special abilities known as [Skills].\r\n\r\nMankind, who had acquired this supernatural power, could now fight equally against the monster's desperately violent attacks.\r\n\r\nOne young man--Kurauchi Satoshi, awakened the ability to tame the enemies of the world, monsters, as well as train and evolve them so that they could become the strongest.\r\n\r\nSatoshi decided to build the strongest monster army by taming, training and evolving monsters to save the world. However, is there no way for people to accept these tamed monsters that are the enemy of mankind....?\r\n\r\nThe is a heartful comedy, low fantasy novel about a monster tamer becoming the strongest.>"
