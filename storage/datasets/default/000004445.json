	"description": "When I woke up, my seven-years worth of memories was gone.\n\nI was a Princess, then became the Grand Duchess,\n\nAnd I was in a hostile relationship with my ‘husband’ who married me four years ago.\n\nAnd last night, which I didn’t remember,\n\nWas my first night with him.\n\n“I waited for four years, and on the next day, you lost your memory. You are truly an amazing woman, aren’t you?”\n\nI think I made a huge mistake.\n\nSo in frustration, I tried to search for my memories.\n\nHowever, when the truth revealed itself to me bit by bit, the reality of the situation was very different from what I previously knew…\n\nAfter losing my memory, will I fall in love with you?\n\nWouldn’t you want to let go of someone who knew nothing?>"
