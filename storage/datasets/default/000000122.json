	"description": "I opened my eyes to find myself in another world. But for some odd reason, I ended up as a sword. Before my eyes laid a plain full of magic beasts, and so, I launched my body and flew in search of a partner, a wielder (females only). \n\nWait.  Absorbing magic stones gets me skills? Oh hell yeah! This will be fun! More, more, give me more! Gimme all your magic stones! Okay, yeah no, but I am accepting anything anyone’s willing to give. \n\nThis tale is one that follows your everyday nerd, normal as could be, save for the fact that he happened to reincarnate as a sword.>"
