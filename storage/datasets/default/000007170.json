	"description": "“It feels good to be on my knees when we’re kissing.” Su Zhou suddenly blurted out prior to dozing off.\n\n“So, it turns out you didn’t like kissing before because I was too good for you.”\n\n“It’s not that…”\n\n“I know,” Xie Luyang embraced Su Zhou firmly from behind. “You want to love me on your knees, right?”\n\n“Mm.”\n\n“You love me, don’t you?”\n\n“Mm.”\n\n“I love you too.”\n--\n\nA safe, sane, and mostly consensual cute BDSM story of a man who discovers he is into BDSM and his love interest who finds out and tries his best to learn how to be a dom in an effort to get close to him.>"
