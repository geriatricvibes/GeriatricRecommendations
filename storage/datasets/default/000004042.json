	"description": "Tian Li, a 17-year-old girl, had two male gods in her heart; one was Liang Jinze, a popular fresh upcoming actor, and the other was Liu Liang, a school idol.\n\nThen, Xiao Liang blindly confessed to her!\n\nTian Li secretly prepared herself to agree during the date with Liu Liang. But when she arrived at the venue, she waited for Liu Liang to arrive. And when he did, he only spoke, “Let’s divorce.”\n\n“As long as you agree, I am willing to leave the house.”\n\nTian Li looked at the man with turbid eyes and grieved, “I support you if you are clean.”\n\nLooking at her twenty-five-year-old body, she sighed in her heart. Sure enough, those who loved early wouldn’t end well!\n\nShe was forced to go eight years into the future, and even had a baby.\n\nThe years had mercilessly taught her that it was not just about feeding or killing pigs, that even if she found another man, the young fresh meat wouldn’t just replace the old one. Finding new love wouldn’t close the injury that the old heartbreak had left behind.>"
