	"description": "In a world where one gains skills by making contracts with gods, Yuno was born as the third son of a famous knight family. However, he was born with too much power to control it and soon became known as incompetent. However, Yuno was satisfied with that. He knew that too much power would bring disaster. However, a chance encounter at the Magic Knight Academy leads to a fateful encounter with a nameless goddess who, like Yuno, is despised for her incompetence. This story is about a boy who makes a contract with a nameless goddess and tries his best to make her the supreme goddess.>"
