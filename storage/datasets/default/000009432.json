	"description": "“Please, Hilise. Please die in place of Gabrielle.”\n\nMy always dignified brother begged me for the first time.\n\nHe wants me to die for our stepsister, whom we don’t even share a drop of blood with.\n\n“For the first and last time, I ask you this.”\n\nI’ve always been miserable, and there is no exception this time.\n\nThe seventh time that I was betrayed and killed, I was completely free of lingering feelings.\n\n“I’m glad that you’re a scumbag until the end.”\n\nI won’t be swayed by love anymore. It’s my turn to abandon them first.>"
