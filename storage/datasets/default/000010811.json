	"description": "The moment I was at the peak of my career as a makeup YouTuber, I possessed someone: the female lead's stepmother, a genius villain of magic tool-making.\n\n“I was worried that I might have a different mind, but that’s fortunate.” \n\nIt didn’t matter that he was the monstrous prince. It’s a contract marriage to connect a male and a female anyway.\n\nOne year after, the contract was broken after enduring numerous misunderstandings. Calypse left the estate. The makeup tool business was successful, and there were two handsome men who were obsessed with her. \n\nBut he, who became emperor, is crazy and searching the whole country for finding me. 'What about the ‘original girl’? Why me?'>"
