	"description": "What will we see after unlocking the dust-covered case files?\n\nMurderers, necrophiliacs, people who converse with the dead. \n\nRapists, psychos, people who can love no one other than themselves. \n\nGrave robbers, tomb destroyers, people who hate the human race. \n\nOne after another, twisted personalities. \n\nOne after another, broken souls. \n\nOne after another, worlds that you’ve not heard of. \n\nThis is hell, \n\nAnd this is heaven.>"
