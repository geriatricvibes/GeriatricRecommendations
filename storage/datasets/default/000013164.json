	"description": "I have committed an unforgivable sin. Even atonement for my sin seemed like a luxury for the rest of my life, and I was only alive because I was breathing......\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I woke up in the body of another person. She is a woman who ingested poison six times in order to gain her husband's love.\r\n\r\nCountess Cecilia Linton. Thanks to her diary, the contents of which looked liked her last will, I realized what I needed to do.\r\n\r\n- I don't want to love my husband anymore...!\r\n\r\nAn absurd life that curses others just for their existence. I don't feel excited about starting a new life, but at the very least, the last wish of a woman who left her body to me should be granted.\r\n\r\n'Cecilia, there will be no more tears for love in the future.'\r\n\r\nNo one loves me and neither do I for a long time. So as long as I became Cecilia, her wish must have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMy encounter with a man named Ricardo Bastian threw everything into confusion.>"
