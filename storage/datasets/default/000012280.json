	"description": "The story takes places in a strange and mysterious rental apartment house. Each tenant has their own unique features, interests and fetishes.\n\nThe landlord is a useless bum who inherited the apartment house through sheer luck, in order to satisfy his own curiosity, he took on a set of unique personalities as tenants. He doesn’t want the hard-working well-behaved students, the office workers with steady incomes, or the simple families. He just wants “normal people” who fits certain criteria, has tendencies for abnormal behaviours, basically anyone who can satisfy his curiosity for the dark side of the human nature.\n\nAs result he ended up with a PE teacher with a record for domestic violence, a university student who is a gaming addict, a divorcee with his angelic little girl, a mysterious writer, a gay couple, and an eye-candy. Eight tenants and a perverted Landlord, six rooms and a bunch of secrets, the potential of our human nature made it impossible to predict how much more secrets each room held.>"
