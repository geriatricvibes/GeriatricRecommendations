	"description": "Her position is high as the empress, but her life is worth that of an ant. She was given the cold shoulder by the emperor. On their wedding night, he cruelly told her, “You are a disgrace!”\n\nHis side consorts aggressively harm her, but he did not distinguish the right and the wrong. He punishes her heartlessly, stabbing her in the chest, almost taking her life. But she merely laughs, enduring everything. She calculates every step she takes, the fiery urge for revenge within her softening him like poison, compelling him to drink more, to quench his thirst even though it is detrimental to him.\n\nWhen he wholeheartedly gave his heart to her, putting it all in her hand while saying, “Yue Er, no matter how many women I have, the only woman in my heart is you.” She gave him a cruel smile, “Thank you, but you are not in mine.”\n\n“In this lifetime, I will definitely obtain your heart.”>"
