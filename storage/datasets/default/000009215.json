	"description": "Nan Kang Bai Qi (04/13/1980 – 03/?/2008) wrote two autobiographical pieces in his life: “Six Records of a Floating Life,” and “Waiting Until 35 Years old.”\n\n“Six Records of a Floating Life” recounts tidbits from the seven years (1999-2006) that Nan Kang and his boyfriend, who he refers to as “husband,” were together. From their first meeting as college first-years, to their cohabiting daily life in their 20s. \n\nIn 2006, their relationship ended, and Nan Kang wrote “Waiting Until 35 Years Old.”>"
