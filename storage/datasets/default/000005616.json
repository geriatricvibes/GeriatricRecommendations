	"description": "Once upon a time, there was an assassin who became unemployed.\r\n\r\nAs his pocket grew thinner, he decided to go around and offered his services like a door-to-door salesman,\r\n\r\n“Do you have any enemy? One head is one hundred taels.”\r\n\r\nIt was such a good offer, yet for some reason, no one took it until…\r\n\r\n“Do you have any enemy? One head is one…fifty taels.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t have any enemy, but I can hire you as my bodyguard.”\r\n\r\n“Assassins also have their pride.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty taels a month, food and accommodation included.”\r\n\r\n“Deal!”\r\n\r\nEver since the assassin became unemployed, a silly short story was born.>"
