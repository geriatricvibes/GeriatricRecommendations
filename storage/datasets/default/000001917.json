	"description": "B city is a huge iron city. A restaurant owner Zhang lives in a remote corner of the city. He’s been here for three years, but nothing exciting happened. Yes, he got a system, but it seems useless. The tasks he got were easy, like walking the dog, growing vegetables, cleaning the house, etc. And the credit he got from the task was of no use.

So his credit is not the system but his dog?>"
