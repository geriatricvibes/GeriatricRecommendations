After the professional transmigrator-identifier Lou Zhu saw through his disguise, the two of them played rounds and rounds of mind games, made dozens and dozens of scenes, and finally reached a consensus at last.\r\n\r\nHowever, while they jointly stopped a shocking conspiracy, they discovered that the transmigrators secretly established an alliance, trying to overthrow the administration and build a new society, and this discovery forced Zuo Yunqi and the others to take part in this warfare of scramble.>"
