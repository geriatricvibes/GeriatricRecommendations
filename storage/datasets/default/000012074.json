	"description": "I am a system. Everyone calls me Golden Finger. I am intelligent and as gorgeous as a flower, desired by all. I have carefully selected a host who is s*upid and cowardly, unmotivated, and absolute tr*sh, one who can best show off my wisdom and brilliance. I had originally thought that in this place which reveres alchemists, I would be able to work with my host to refine godly elixirs and accomplish great things.\n\nBut I’m starting to realise, something isn’t quite right… \n\nCowardly: Killing off his evil disciple with 2 words?\n\nTr*sh: Refining a legendary elixir in 2 seconds? Huh? Wait, why am I being used to refine poison, help!\n\nOnly later did I find out, this host has another identity, the villain!! The infamous demon of the neighbouring continent that turns people’s faces pale with fear, the evil demon king that can silence the cries of children in the night.>"
