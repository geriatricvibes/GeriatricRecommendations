	"description": "In the era of great cultivation under the global aura revival, people do not believe in ghosts and gods, only in the evolution of life.\r\nThe ghosts and gods that the ancients called worshiped, when the mystery was revealed to the end, were nothing more than a species of life evolving to a higher level.\r\nAll demons and gods are created in this world because of the dwelling of demons and gods in the heart of man. Beware of the absence of ghosts and gods, and the world will naturally be free of ghosts and gods.>"
