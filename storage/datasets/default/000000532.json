	"description": "Shiori Sugimura was just a normal second year high school student when her world shattered when she remembered her past life. In her previous life she was a serious Yuri Otaku, and with that knowledge she also realized that the world she has been living in is the Yuri game “Fragmented Rhapsody”. It was a game that she enjoyed dearly in her previous life, and now she is a sub-Heroine.\n\nThis wasn’t good news, she doesn’t want to get involved with the protagonist and simply wants to keep her peaceful life. However that can’t last, she chose to give up that dream, and protect with all her might Sara Fujioka, her favorite heroine and a character that is killed by a love rival in the bad ending!\n\nYanderes are scary, and the characters in the world don’t act like they should. The scenarios are changing and the world is different than before, but she will still do her best to protect her fan favorite.>"
