	"description": "I was killed by a virus that a god dropped on the earth. At that god’s arrangement, I’m going to be reincarnated into another world! Now then, what should I ask from this god? Becoming a hero? A cool sword? Magic? I don't want those kinds of stuff! It's fun to read or watch those battle scenes, but it's definitely going to be hellish to do it yourself! All I wanted was a  well-paying job with a moderate 3-4 hours of work a day. But… Goddamnit. He didn't make me a tool shop’s owner, he made me a tool shop (building)!\r\n\r\nIn a forest where no one comes, I (A building) am alone... Will I really be able to live the slow life in another world I want?!>"
