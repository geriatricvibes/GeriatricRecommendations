	"description": "Her step-sister just died three months ago. Now, she insists on marrying Chu Lui, who is supposed to be her future brother-in-law, the mind behind the Chu Enterprise. The world is sure that she, the new bride-to-be, had caused her step-sister’s death in order to seduce him. \n\nEven her own mother says to her cruelly, “Don’t call me ‘Mom’. I don’t have a daughter as vicious as you.”>"
