	"description": "Ryouma Saeki and Yuina Kanzaki, who had been together for as long as they can remember, decided to go out with each other at a certain point. However, from there Yuina started to show her unmannered appearance. \n\nRyouma, who fulfilled all of her demands, started to wear black rimmed glasses, overgrew his bangs, wore a fake beard which made him feel filthy, and became average in exercise and studying.\n\nOne day, Ryouma, who was suspicious because Yuina became moody and less likely to go home with him, followed her. \n\nThe incident that happened there led to him being dumped by Yuina.\n\n“You are no longer cool and I don’t get excited when I am with you. That’s why I decided to go out with Kenji-kun and so we’re breaking up. Bye – bye “.\n\nRyouma, who was betrayed as a result of devoting himself to his childhood friend, thought: [If I've been dumped, then my current look no longer means much anymore].\n\nHence Ryouma no longer holds himself back, and the attitudes surrounding him suddenly changes!>"
