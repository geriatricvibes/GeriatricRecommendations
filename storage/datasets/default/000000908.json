	"description": "After transmigrating into the body of an abandoned wife of a little marquis in Ancient China, Su Nuan Nuan, a modern-day food lover was delighted!\n\nWho cares about being abandoned?\n\nLook at this nice garden, just right for a vegetable patch, let’s just live our life freely without constraint. Dear husband can just play with those secondary wives and concubines, while she lives the luxurious and free life of an abandoned official wife.\n\nFinally, she can fulfill her dream of doing nothing but eat, sleep and cook. Let’s cook more delicious food with all these all organic, non-GMO ingredients!\n\nBut the good times did not last long.\n\nHer husband grew curious about the new and exciting dishes coming out of her little kitchen and wanted her back in his inner palace.\n\nToo bad Nuan Nuan had no interest in being part of his harem.\n\nJust go away, you slutty Male Lead!>"
