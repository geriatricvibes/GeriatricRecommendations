Jian Sangyu considers Gu Chen as an old-fashioned man who is boring and intimidating, but Gu Chen, who is a chief at the most important guardian team in the country stays faithful to his wife and finds himself a very qualified husband.\n\nOne day, an unexpected earthquake happens, and the couple finds themselves trapped under the rubble. Gu Chen protects Jian Sangyu with his own body, yet both of them die because of the delayed rescue.\n\nHowever, Jian Sangyu is reborn and returns to the year before the earthquake. Although she is still married to Gu Chen, Jian Sangyu decides to do something different with her life by becoming a famous movie star so as to live independently, totally away from Gu Chen.\n\nWhat she has not expected is that her relationship with Gu Chen changes with her second chance at life. Real love begins to bud between them and Jian Sangyu, who has always wanted to divorce Gu Chen, gradually finds herself attached to this man whilst Gu Chen soon realizes that this lovely young wife of his needs more than a loyal husband, but someone who truly cares and loves her with all of his heart.>"
