	"description": "Can sensei be the heroine? Please?\n\nDue to a traumatic experience, I have a distrust of people called “sensei”. I, Saiki Makoto, was called by after school by the most popular and beautiful teacher at my school, Fujiki Maka-sensei.\n\n“I… love you” Eh– a confession out of the blue!? “Until you say you love me, I will continue to pursue you”\n\nEver since then, I’ve been called by for “guidance counselling” after school, somehow watched AV together, being given excessive skin-ship, went on dates together. Over time, I gradually became conscious of Sensei…? But isn’t it bad for Sensei to go out with her student? \n\nA romance that is absolutely NG, the forbidden love between us two.\n\nLesson start!>"
