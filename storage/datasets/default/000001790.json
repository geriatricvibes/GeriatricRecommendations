	"description": "Based on the popular Vocaloid song '' by HoneyWorks:\r\n\r\n“An announcement to the new students! The teary-eyed angel over there called Otosaki Rin is going to be my girlfriend, so keep your hands off her. Ah, and don’t fall for her either, of course.”\r\n\r\nNo way. I can’t believe this.\r\nWhat, why did it end up like this.\r\n\r\nOn the stage in the gymnasium with all the students gathered together, Kagami Len declared in a loud voice, the spotlight shining down on him. My head spinning from the unthinkable timing of what he shouldn’t have said, even now it feels like I’m about to collapse. \r\nAs I’m dumbfounded, the root of all evil waves his hand at me, his face beaming with a smile.\r\n\r\nAnd so, because of a certain playboy, it was suddenly decided that the plain me’s high school life will end up turning into an uproar.\r\n\r\nThe novel is split into three parts, each taking the title of a song . The first part is '<i>Suki Kirai</i>' (chapters 1-6), the second part is '<i>Nakimushi Kareshi</i>' (chapters 7-9) and the last part is '<i>Hajimari no Sayonara</i>' (chapters 10-13).>"
