One day during the second grade of middle school, Kana told Kota 'Don't talk to me for the rest of your life', and then the two of them became distant.  However, now in his second grade of high school, Kana is sitting in front of Kota.  Kota thought, 'Well, I guess I won't be able to talk to you.'>"
