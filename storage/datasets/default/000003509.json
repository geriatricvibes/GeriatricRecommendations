	"description": "I had a supporting role in a modern fantasy.\n\nThe loyal dog of a villain with an angel’s name, Cheon Sa-yeon, and an unfortunate supporting character who died on his behalf, Han Yi-gyeol.\n\nIn order to escape from Cheon Sa-yeon and survive, he must use the protagonist, Ha Tae-heon.\n\nBut Ha Tae-heon, who he thought of as a lifeline, was infinitely indifferent to him. Rather, Cheon Sa-yeon showed interest.\n\nBut besides that, something strange happened.\n\nThe events that occurred in the original story had advanced, and the gate and monster levels had risen. Even the people were “different” from the original.\n\nThe original version I was trying to use was wrong.>"
