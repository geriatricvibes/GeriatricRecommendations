	"description": "A world of magic.\n\nI had a dream ever since I was young, and that was to become ‘a receptionist onee-san’ at a certain place. But only first-class magicians could become one, or so my parents told me… First-class? So what? What about it? That meant I just had to work hard to become first-class, right?\n\n…… Or, the story that portrays the heroine’s road to become a receptionist, and her daily life after she becomes one.>"
