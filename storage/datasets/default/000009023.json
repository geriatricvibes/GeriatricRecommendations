	"description": "“He is the entertainment king who is in charge of everything. Been single for years, he had zero scandal. One day, a woman and a girl turned his life upside down.\n\nThe little cutie held him tight, not letting go. “”Handsome uncle, you look very much like the daddy I have lost for many years!”” Huo Yunshen felt depressed. “Me? Daddy?!”\n\nThe little cutie proudly pulled her mommy over, “”Mommy, I have found a long-term meal ticket for you, handsome and gullible.””\n\nXu Xiyan smiled at the elegant man.\n\nRecalling the accident five years ago, his face sank. “”How dare you steal my DNA?””\n\nShe laughed. “”Not steal, just borrow!”” The man took her in his arms and warned in a dangerous tone, “”Woman, should I get what’s mine back, with interest?””\n\nShe stood on her toes. “”Yeah, how about another baby?”””>"
