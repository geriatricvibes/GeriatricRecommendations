	"description": "I was a middle-aged woman who lived as a duchess hated by everyone. So, I created a fake body and ran away. The funeral had gone well, and I was officially a dead person.\n\nThen a strange rumor began to circulate.\n\nApparently, upon my death, my husband had gone mad.\n\n***\n\nDehart whispered with his head down, “Can’t I ever call you Sebelia again?”\n\n“No, you can’t.”\n\n“Even if I kneel down like this?”\n\n“Even if you give your life to me.” Sebelia bent forward slightly and whispered in his ear, “Dehart, I’m generous to people who have a good grasp of the subject.”\n\nHis heart gave a jolt. He looked at Sebelia with trembling eyes.\n\nIn the past, it was I who said that.\n\n[I’m generous to people who have a good grasp of the subject]\nThat was Dehart’s first words to Sebelia.>"
