	"description": "Throughout the ages, there are only two words in the world, love and hate. \n\nThree years ago, Qin Shan was the most profitable sword in the hands of the emperor. He cut others and made himself bleed. After several years of shackles, he entered the world again. The world seems to be a little different. His infamy is still circulating in the world. \n\nThe heroic swordsman carried his reward everywhere, and everyone was looking for the trace of the big devil. However, Qin Damo was holding his own order of chasing and asked with a smile. “The head on the neck, can I change the wine?” \n\nEntering the WTO again, this river and lake has one more word in Qin Shan’s eyes. It was someone holding a long sword, wind and rain, and the words engraved in his heart.>"
