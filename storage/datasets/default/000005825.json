	"description": "Qin Ran grew up in the countryside. She disappeared for one year and lost a year of high school.\n\nOne year later, she was taken to Yuncheng by her biological mother to attend school.\n\nHer mother said: your stepfather is from a prestigious family, your big brother is a genius, your younger sister is a top student, you must not lose their faces.\n\n*\n\nEveryone of status in the capital has received a warning from Cheng family’s Junye: Junye’s wife is from the countryside; she doesn’t understand the circle, doesn’t understand the current circumstances, doesn’t understand the financial markets. Her character is very… in short, please excuse me.\n\nUntil one day, Junye investigated a big shot, his subordinates looked at the sockpuppet that had come off her while she said she knew nothing about it… they sank into a bewildered silence.\n\nIt was probably a story of two big shots trying to hide their sockpuppets* so that the other didn’t feel inferior.\n\nSockpuppet - internet slang for hidden identity >"
