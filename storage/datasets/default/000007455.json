The flower also represents the arrival of spring.\n\n*****\n\nA girl cursed by the gods and rejected by the world meets the legendary “Princess Tsubakiri”, a vengeful demon with a fairy tale to tell and a cruel offer for the one deepest in despair.\n\nA medieval dark fantasy with a tortured heroine, this is a tale of those who renounce the self-proclaimed righteous, even if they must stake their bloody claim against all the world.>"
