A total nut, he wreaks havoc on the school's student body and gets into a world of trouble with the teachers!\r\n\r\nBut there's more to Sousuke than meets the eye--not just a hell-raising student, he's actually a member of an elite military unit, on an undercover mission to protect the beautiful schoolgirl Kaname Chidori from the KGB. Discover the mystery as this comedy-action-science-fiction story unfolds!>"
