	"description": "One day, I realized that I, a former Japanese, has reincarnated into a different world as Cristea Ellisfeed, a Duke’s daughter . Reincarnation…? Duke’s daughter…? A world with magic…? Is this a light novel!?!? I received the reality while being confused. However… I’m dissatisfied with this! This full course is somewhat dissatisfying! Sweet-only sweets! I’m sick of it already!! The taste of commoners, please!!>"
