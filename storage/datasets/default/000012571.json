Suddenly the whole alliance and the demonic sect had crossed over to be the students of Class A and Class F. \n\nSo this group of people climbed the wall and went to the Internet cafe, stayed up late to read novels, and participated in the sports meeting with 18 kinds of martial arts…\n\nThe students at Wulin No. 1 Middle school were going crazy. Every day, they trembled under the authority of these two big bosses. They were caught in the middle of these two classes that were sanctioned with iron fists.
