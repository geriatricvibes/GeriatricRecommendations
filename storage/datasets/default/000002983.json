For her childhood best friend to still run away after all this, what was the point of her learning marital art all these years? The saddest thing to come out of all this was the fact that she was the one feeling burdened all this time… \r\n\r\nFive years later. \r\n\r\n“Mommy! How come I am so cute but I do not have a daddy?” \r\n\r\n“How should I know? Go ask your daddy!” \r\n\r\nXia Yuxun watched the newly married couple through the TV screen and answered without looking back. \r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, at the live wedding that was being broadcasted, a crying child was grabbing onto the groom’s leg and screaming “daddy”. The man stared at the miniature version of himself and asked, “Where’s your mommy?” \r\n\r\nXia Yuxun, who was watching this live show gulped, “You brat, you are digging your mom a hole!” \r\n\r\n>"
