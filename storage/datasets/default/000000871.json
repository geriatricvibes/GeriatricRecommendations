	"description": "'Roger, the Lord’s Mansion is offering a reward for the corpse demon, do you want to pick it up together?' \r\n\r\n'No, I'm not very strong, so I won't take risks.' \r\n\r\n'Roger, we still have one spot for the southern mine, would you like to come?' \r\n\r\n 'Maybe next time...' \r\n\r\n'Roger, Roger... Nevermind, forget that I’ve asked.' \r\n\r\nTen years later. \r\n\r\n[You killed 1 Explosive Magic Frog, killing 164250 Explosive Magic Frogs in total] \r\n\r\n[Your magic resistance is increased to 100%] \r\n\r\nRoger, who was at the pool, rubbed his sore waist and said to himself, 'Finally... I seem to have become a little stronger.' \r\n\r\n... \r\n\r\nThis was a fantasy wasteland world that had been radiated by nineteenth circle spells. Roger had been teleported with the profession model of 'Hermit Ranger'. He had only one wish: Before the real catastrophe broke out, he aimed to become a stronger every single day.>"
