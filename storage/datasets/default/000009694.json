	"description": "This is a book can be thumbed through in an afternoon when you are chilling at a café, or at a sleepless night after working late. You can see me as a close friend who is exchanging toasts and getting tipsy with you.\n\nThe stories may not be beautiful, but thank God the world is. I know we are leading lives of great difference. However, I do believe you can see yet another facet of the life that’s not accessed by you from my stories. A facet just like wines at night, dewy flowers in the morning, plain yet real, beautiful yet heartbreaking.\n\nWith luck my stories are to be continued, with luck your solitude will end.>"
