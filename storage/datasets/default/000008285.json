But when his master is killed, he regains his freedom, and is now unrestricted to travel the world to his utmost desire.\n\nIn the beginning, Albert had lost his wings because of the harsh duties given to him for the past 1,500 years, but he has become one of the strongest beings alive because of it, despite being a Gargoyle.>"
