	"description": "Yun Qian Yue, the sole legitimate daughter of the Yun Wangfu in the Heavenly Saint Dynasty, was a well-known anarchic young girl who behaved arrogantly and had a bad reputation. During a poem-appreciation gathering, she almost died in a fight for her lover’s favor.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Yun, who was laying down her life for her country, had her soul fall into another world and was reborn as Yun Qian Yue.\n\nAn anarchic young girl vs. a young female general – her arrival brought a great change in the seemingly peaceful Heavenly Saint Dynasty.\n\nYou said I was arrogant?\n\nI was anarchic?\n\nI was actually the first-class waste of the Heavenly Saint Dynasty, the legitimate daughter of the Yun Wangfu, the designated Crown Princess, and the most distinguished female in the whole Dynasty?\n\nDamn it!\n\nYou really had to force me to tell the truth that I feigned all these things?>"
