	"description": "In the 1980s, Zhang Hao had amassed unparalleled name, fame and wealth thanks to his unique cheat skill.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to become the richest man in the world, a mysterious letter opened the door of a new world for him.\r\n\r\n“Uh! What? Are you telling me now that I have crossed into the world of Harry Potter? God, are you kidding me?!”\r\n\r\nWith great expectations, Zhang Hao finally walked into Hogwarts.\r\n\r\nAnd as a result, a lot of common sense in the magic world was broken…\r\n\r\nProfessor McGonagall, “Oh! Mr. Zhang, what have you become? Why have I never seen such a creature?”\r\n\r\nProfessor Flitwick, “It’s amazing! Is this Lumos Maxima improved from the Lumos Spell? Mr. Zhang, you are such a genius!”\r\n\r\nProfessor Snape, “Harry Potter! I think you should learn more from Zhang Hao. You can never match his talent and resolve!”\r\n\r\nProfessor Dumbledore, “Child! Your light is so dazzling. I think you can keep a low profile. How about giving Harry a chance?”\r\nZhang Hao said with an innocent look, “I also want to keep a low profile, but my strength doesn’t allow it!”>"
