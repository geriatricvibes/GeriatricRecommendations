	"description": "It's not a world where anyone can be the main character.\r\n\r\nLute, the protagonist of this story who has everything: honor, fame, money, power, and women, has stolen my childhood friend that I loved, and it seems that she became one of his harem members.\r\n\r\nIn the face of Lute, who is capable of defeating the demon king and is popular enough to build a harem, I realize that I am a mob in this story.\r\n\r\nThe main heroine of the story that Lute is so crazy about that he can't even look at the other heroines.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the story, it should be her fate to be attached to the hero, but for some reason, the heroine dotes on me, the mob.\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected romantic comedy story that unfolds at a magic academy in a fantasy world.\r\n>"
