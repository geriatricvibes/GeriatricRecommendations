	"description": "616 feels that as a 24-carat pure Bad Man System, bad men’s tasks are much better than being a goody-two-shoes. It can be completed by just pulling any passerby. However, it pulled Lu Ze.\n\n616: “Ahhhhh, why you are doing this? Why are you spoiling her?! You’re a bad man, it’s just a matter of letting her die!!!”\n\nLu Ze had an innocent expression: “Yes, ah… I’m a bad man. Didn’t you hear my wife scolded me for being naughty last night?”\n\n#who said a man can’t be pampered by his wife’s family#\n\n#how the scum man doesn’t collapse; but spoils his wife, younger sister, and parents#\n\n#the proud man spoils his wife daily#>"
