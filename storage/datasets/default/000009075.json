	"description": "I died. When I woke up, I was in the world of the  Otome Game [Rose Garden]…? No way! What’s more, I was reborn as the girl with the reputation of [Unlucky • Unrequited • Pathetic], that is to say, the old royal family’s princess, the Heroine’s rival, Remilia-sama isn’t it?! However, I prefer the main couple! I would like to watch the love of the Princess and Ryuko if possible! Political dispute of the new and old royal family? I want to live peacefully and safely regardless of it! And that is, to sometimes leisurely take a walk in the sky with a dragon. A fantasy of magic and dragon that can be folded as [Let’s Quit being a Villain • Let’s Give up the First Love • Get Straight to Home].>"
