	"description": "I am a knight. To be precise, I am the Church of the God of Light’s Sun Knight.\n\nThe Church of the God of Light worships and serves the God of Light, and theirs’ one of the three largest religions on this continent.\n\nAs the whole continent knows, the Church of the God of Light has the Twelve Holy Knights, and each one has his own unique personality and features.\n\nTo be the Sun Knight is to have shining golden hair, sky blue eyes, a compassionate nature, and a brilliant smile.\n\n“The benevolent God of Light will forgive your sins.”\n\nI must have said that line at least a million times in my time as the Sun Knight.\n\nHowever, the greatest wish in my life is to be able to stand before the entire continent and roar, “Damn your ‘the whole continent knows’! This Sun Knight just doesn’t feel like smiling! I just don’t want to forgive these human tr*shes! I just want to pepper my sentences with ‘f***’!”\n\nUnfortunately, even to this day, I continue to wear a smile as I say, “The benevolent God of Light will forgive your sins.”>"
