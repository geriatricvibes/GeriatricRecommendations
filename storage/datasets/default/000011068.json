	"description": "The long war for supremacy between two neighboring nations came to an end.\n\nFor this reason, Raiz, the strongest tamer ever seen, was facing a difficult problem.\n\nHow could the multitude of monsters called to arms survive without  work to sustain them?\n\nWorried, he decided to open a “shop” to find jobs for his comrades.\n\n“Right! Let’s start our own guild!”\n\nEven though at first people were afraid, seeing the monsters working so hard for their sake made them change their mind and after forgiving those creatures, the guild started receiving quite the number of requests.\n\n“Nice, if we put our heart and soul in working we’ll make a fortune!”\n\nThat’s how the strongest tamer started a family business (with a ranch).>"
