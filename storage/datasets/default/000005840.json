	"description": "My favorite novel is complete.\r\n\r\n“How to survive in a superhuman school”, abbreviated as “super massacre”.\r\n\r\nIt is a work in which the author enters his novel and struggles to survive.\r\nThere, I, a reader, came in. According to the author, if you look at the ending, everything gained from this place becomes a reality, but if you die on the way, it's all in vain.\r\n\r\nIf so, the survivors would have to live till the end. And take everything they can.\r\n\r\nNo matter how bad the original story is, no matter how many people die, you persevere in hiding.\r\n\r\n......In the end, if I kill the Demon King, I win.>"
