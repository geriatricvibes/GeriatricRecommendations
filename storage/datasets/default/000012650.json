	"description": "I used to be a human girl, I can’t recall my name nor how I looked. All because I’ve turned into a dragon. What’s more, in a certain kingdom I am considered a sacred dragon. My diet consists of humans. It seems that after eating a human, that human’s magical power is what sustains me.\n\nI’m a type of dragon called an “Earth Dragon”, which for generations have formed contracts with humans in a certain kingdom, leading that kingdom to victory in wars against other kingdoms. I don’t care about that any of that. I just want to live in peace. However before long my human eating escapades branded me as a “man-eating dragon”.\n\nGrowing tired of killing those sent to vanquish me, I decided to entered human society, I ending up serving in the castle, where tasty looking humans abounded.>"
