	"description": "What do you do when you wake up and find yourself inside the very game that you love?\n\nWhat do you do when you realize you that you have not only become an NPC – you have even been thrown back in time to before the game even launched!\n\nWhat will happen when our protagonist’s two realities coincide?\n\nHan Xiao was a professional power leveler before his transmigration. Using his past life’s knowledge, Han Xiao sweeps through the universe as he prepares for the arrival of the players. This is definitely not your typical transmigration novel.>"
