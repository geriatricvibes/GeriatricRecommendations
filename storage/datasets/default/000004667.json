	"description": "In her previous life, she had trusted the wrong person with her heart. She had thrown everything away for that man, dooming her entire family to the point where even their bones had become ash in the wind. In this life, she caught his fancy. Upon starting her life over, she joined hands with her Jiangshi* husband; punching white boned demons, fighting fox spirits…\n\nIn the midst of this chaotic world, she joins him in pursuit of a common goal…\n\n*A Jiangshi is the Chinese Hopping Zombie which drinks blood instead of eating brains likes western zombies. So we didn’t use zombie because it would give the wrong image… or use Vampire which technically covers all blood-drinking creatures because it isn’t that either.>"
