	"description": "“Let say it! I hate a situation where a childhood friend is defeated!”\r\n\r\nMy childhood friend 'Kanzaki Amane' who I used to play with when we were kids. She and I naturally drifted apart just because she was the opposite sex....... When I got to high school, I realized she was beautiful and bright. She has excellent grades, athletics, and has become so high up in the world that she can't even say that she's my childhood friend now. \r\nAmachi Yumeji watches her from afar, but one day he comes across a mysterious book that can control dreams.\r\n\r\nAt first, I enjoyed dreaming about all kinds of things that I liked, following my desires. As a result of the “dream”, Amane, who was supposed to be estranged from me, began to break into my room through the window............ Are? Isn't this a dream?>"
