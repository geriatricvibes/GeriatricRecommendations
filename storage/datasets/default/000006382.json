In this lifetime too, please be happy until you grow old.”\r\n\r\nWhen she went to work, he stood by the door to see her off and told her, 'Come back early today. I'll prepare some delicious food for you tonight.'\r\n\r\nWhen he revealed the truth, he said, 'I came to repay a debt of gratitude, for the two hundred and tenth time.'\r\n\r\nWhen she asked him, '...How can you bear the pain of losing your loved one again and again?' \r\n\r\nHe replied, 'Since the first time I did this, I told you that I would always be with you. This is my forever. I am very happy. As for death... It is because after witnessing your death, that I can experience the joy of reunion.'\r\n\r\n'After having lost the previous you, I would cherish you and every second of your life, even more, when we meet again.'\r\n>"
