	"description": "One day, under a wintry sky. Kuroshima Kazuya encountered Shiroyume Miyu, who was crying alone. Although they were only classmates, Kazuya couldn't leave the crying girl alone, so he talked to her and asked her why she was crying.\r\n\r\nThe reason was because her parents had cast her away. She had been discarded as an unwanted child because she was the child of a mistress. And then Miyu said that she would just die. \r\n\r\nKazuya, who couldn’t just leave her alone, suggested to Miyu for her to come to his house. And with that, the two of them began living together. \r\n\r\nThis is the story of a girl who was abandoned by her parents and a boy who bought her, and how they became happy.\r\n>"
