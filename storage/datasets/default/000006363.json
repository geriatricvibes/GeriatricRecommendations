	"description": "The previous lords have committed as many atrocities as possible to fill their bellies. I, the only daughter of that house, had discovered that my servant and lover was a spy.\n\nAnd as the people wanted, my life ended with my execution.\n\nHowever, with the memory of getting beheaded intact, I began a new life. I was planning to shoulder the sins of my past life and become a nun, but by some trick of fate, I came to work as a maid for the current lord.\n\nUnder my former lover, whose name, age and even hair colour were all lies.>"
