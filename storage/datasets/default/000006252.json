	"description": "Peizhe’s broad shoulders were covered with a fine layer of snow.\nA somewhat oppressive and tingly kiss that one loathed to part with.\n\nPeizhe pressed his lips against the corner of Jiang Yunqi’s moist and warm lips, whispering, “Jiang Yunqi, I’ve given you a chance.”\n\nJiang Yunqi looked up. He didn’t understand and subconsciously stretched out the tip of his tongue to lick Peizhe’s slightly cool lips.\n\nDark eyes looked into Jiang Yunqi’s. Peizhe closed his eyes and kissed those lips fiercely again.\n\nThe force of the attack made Jaing Yunqi’s legs go weak.\nThe traces in the snow were easiest to follow.\n\nA person with deeply etched footprints, clear directions and clear goals was glad that he had firmly grasped what he wanted before the arrival of the next snow.>"
