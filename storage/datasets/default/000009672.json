	"description": "After passing , Wang Yan discovered that he had become the Wang Yan in another world.\r\n\r\nThe original Wang Yan was eager to seek immortality and learn the Tao, but he was helpless and  couldn't endure the hardship. He finally learned a wall-piercing technique and also caused the spell to fail due to his unrighteous mind.\r\n\r\nToday's Wang Yan was not willing to be mediocre, not afraid of hardships, and would firmly grasp the opportunity when the opportunity comes. How could he dismiss the small wall penetration technique. He would cultivate in every way. He was confident.\r\n\r\nCultivation, academic method, spiritual refining, seeking longevity...\r\n\r\nWitness the ruin of the dynasty and experienced the turmoil of demons...\r\n\r\nAncient temple painting wall, overseas underground market...\r\n\r\nWhen the pure land on earth is hard to find, Taoist priests hold swords, but they can punish evil spirits. They are full of spirit and dare to ask the world's injustice!\r\n\r\nThis is a little man’s journey to become immortal... >"
