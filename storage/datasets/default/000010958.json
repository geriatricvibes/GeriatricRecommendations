	"description": "[I] who was unskillful at romance, was misunderstood by the person whom I finally fell in love with and was being harshly embraced. After crying myself to sleep, I woke up on the bed of an unfamiliar room. An unfamiliar man, an unfamiliar world. I certainly fell asleep while wishing for a reset. When will I wake up from this dream? As I continued to ponder, I ended up having the exact same occupation that I had in my original world (a soldier).\r\n\r\nThis is the story of love and war involving the beautiful ice knight and the three handsome dukes who are slightly peculiar.>"
