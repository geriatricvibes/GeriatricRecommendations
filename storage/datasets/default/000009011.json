	"description": "Once upon a time in the small town of Hiraya, Nagano Prefecture, lived a normal high schooler named Rin Ichirou.\n\nOne stormy night, he found a Princess named Pau and the Female Knight (Valkyrie) who served her, Clauzela Lou Kotovic, collapsed in the middle of paddy field.\n\nBoth of them had escaped from their country which fell to an Orc army attack using Gate magic.\n\nAnd now they established government in exile at Rin Ichirou’s house.\n\nBetween a jealous stalker childhood friend, Princess Pau and Clau’s fascination at Japanese modern technology and culture, and super dense Rin Ichirou, a slapstick comedy choked with otaku culture reference in a rural Nagano countryside will begin!\n\nAlso, the people from this world and from that world began to visit one after another.>"
