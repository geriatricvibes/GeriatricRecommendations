	"description": "Tang Yi, a young actor whom Yun Zheng bullied in her childhood, had already become a first-rate little fresh meat.\n\nNot only did he save her in the water and fire, but he also lowered his own salary to become the male lead in her new drama. His only requirement was that she would personally help him in his acting.\n\nBut… the stuff that would need some guidance is either kissing scenes /bed scenes.\n\nTang Yi calmly replied: “What else can I do, I have never been in love, never kissed, have no X experience, I can’t act this out.”\n\nTang Yi is nicknamed Tang Sixteen because as long as there is a scandal involving him, he will surely clear them up within sixteen hours.\n\nWhen the scandal of Tang Yi and Yunzheng broke out, the fans waited and waited and waited and waited…\n\nWhile still waiting, they finally understood.>"
