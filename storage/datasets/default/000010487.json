	"description": "I accidentally spent the night with three men.\r\n\r\nOne of them was a childhood friend that I hadn’t seen in ages.\r\n\r\nOne was a feisty elf who I haven’t talked to for a long time.\r\n\r\nOne of them was a fellow researcher?\r\n\r\nTo make such a terrible mistake!\r\n\r\nKriserua failed an important quest on that day.\r\n\r\nI tried to erase their memories and focus on handling requests…\r\n\r\n“Have a child? You?”\r\n\r\nEventually, they found out that I was pregnant.\r\n\r\nWhat am I supposed to do with this nonsense?\r\n\r\nMore than that, I have to deal with failure first!\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind, I’ll live thinking it’s my child.”\r\n\r\n“No one is more suitable than me as the father of the child.”\r\n\r\n“That day is my responsibility, so I will be responsible.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, they started chasing after me, who's on a journey to rectify the mess.\r\n\r\n‘No! I don’t need you guys!’\r\n\r\nA delightful and exhausting adventure story of Kriserua, a tactless yet straight-laced person, and the unrequited love of three men who can’t communicate with each other!>"
