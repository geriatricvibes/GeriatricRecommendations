	"description": "“How did you know? I’m good enough at it that no one should have known.”\n\nAdrian Caesar von der Pfalzgraf, the successor to the Pfalzgraf family. The world praised him as an angel—but only I knew. The public was set abuzz by the news of the recent serial murders and attempted murders, and that all of them had been committed by a handsome young man.\n\n「 Adrian’s killing intent is rising. 」\n\n「 Convince Adrian to lower his killing intent. Otherwise, you will die. 」\n\n「 Adrian’s killing intent – 92% 」\n\nIt was only me who knew—that the world I’m living in right now is a crazily ridiculous horror game.>"
