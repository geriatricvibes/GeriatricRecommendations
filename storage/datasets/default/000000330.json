	"description": "“Your Grace, there’s something I’d really like for my birthday.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Will you promise to listen?”\n\nThen the man blatantly laughed.\n\nBut who would point out his arrogance – a young Northern Duke who’s not even afraid of the Emperor? He could even get a throne if he wished for it.\n\nBut it was just a sweet lover’s birthday wish.\n\n“Alright. I swear.”\n\nSo, Juliet spoke lightly,\n\n“Please break up with me. I don’t love you anymore.”\n\nA fiancé just for show. A succession of meaningless nights.\n\nNow is the time to end seven years of unrequited love.>"
