	"description": "The fact that I like men is something that the whole town knows, because my boyfriend is Zhao Gongzi.\n\nZhao Gongzi, who is the mayor’s grandson, Gangster leader Master Zhao Si’s son and Warlord General Huo’s little brother-in-law.  The Zhao Gongzi who is, in name, my adopted brother, since I was taken in by Master Zhao Si . The reason I was adopted and wasn’t simply a servant is because of Zhao Gongzi. He needed someone to accompany him at school, and I filled that role till I was 18. Then, after I had graduated and Zhao Gongzi had completed school without graduating, we slept together–that is to say, he f*cked me. \n\nBefore I turned 18, I was always confused as to why he treated me so nicely, and I finally got the answer. I also lost something with that knowledge. \n\n　　f*ck his mom.\n\nI said nothing, you all heard nothing.>"
