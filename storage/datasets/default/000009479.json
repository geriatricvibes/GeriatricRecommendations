	"description": "He was recognized as the strongest existence, standing at the top of the world. Wealth? Reputation? Power? They were all not worth mentioning in his eyes. The strongest apostle fled, appearing on the humans' continent.\r\n\r\nBut the reason was, 'Don't misunderstand! I'm here to find my future wife!' That's right, this is a story about the history's strongest apostle finding a wife.>"
