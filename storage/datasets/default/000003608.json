	"description": "One day, I was called out by my fiance, the first prince, Leon-sama and asked to come to the gardens of the royal palace. When I got there, Leon-sama and a lovely woman who clung to him awaited me… eh? He wants to break off the engagement? Wouldn’t that mean I won’t have to receive that severe queen’s training? Great!>"
