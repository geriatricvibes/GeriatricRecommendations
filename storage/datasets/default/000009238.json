	"description": "Yan Yan transmigrated into a novel and became the biggest villain in the book.\n\nThe villain originally thought she was the long lost noble daughter of the Ming Family. Upon returning to the Ming Family, she wholeheartedly wanted to eliminate her little uncle to inherit the family property. But before she could eliminate her little uncle, the real noble daughter returned. As a result, the villain was swept out of the house and ruthlessly killed by the little uncle. \n\nOn the day Yan Yan transmigrated as the villain, she swore she would definitely not covet Little Uncle’s family property, definitely not go against Little Uncle’s wishes, and definitely not hinder Little Uncle from chasing the female protagonist!\n\nPreserving her little life, she found an opportunity to inform Little Uncle, “Actually, I am not the real Miss Ming.”\n\nLittle Uncle pulled on his tie when he heard her words and gave her a meaningful smile: “Really? That’s great.”\n\nYan Yan: ??????\n\nCan someone explain to her what this means?>"
