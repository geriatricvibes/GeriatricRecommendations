	"description": "A poor man without a proper weapon won’t be able to become a great adventurer even if he puts his life on the line.\r\n\r\nDean, a third-rate adventurer was living the poor life, worked as a porter and did various odd jobs like dismantling demon beasts and or carrying luggage more often than fighting the demon beast itself.\r\n\r\nTill one day he fell into dire straits, surrounded by flocks of monster, due to the misjudgement of his employers. He was left behind to die as a decoy for those demon beast.\r\n\r\nBut then he found the heart of a Gluttony Demon which still retained a large amount of power in a hole he evacuated and escaped into. The heart of a Gluttony Demon gave the ability to snatch the skills of beings that have been eaten.\r\n\r\nArmed with the Demon Sword of Gluttony which could grow indefinitely, Dean aimed to become a first-rate adventurer.>"
