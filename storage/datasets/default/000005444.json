Let me tell you, how a man should be!\n\nThey need to have large build, there must be three buttons left unbuckled. When they walk, they should looked unrestrained, and when they are standing, they should look casual and elegant. At times they will smoke, and raises my chin with one of the hand, lowering their head and puffs out all the smoke into my face. Looking at me with a worn out, deep, helpless, sad and luring eyes and say:”Woman, from now on, you shall be mine.”\n\n—You prefer this type of……beast and animal?\n\nAlright, no matter how frivolous Dear Wife is, I won’t go over the line and inquire about it. But if we don’t get married first, you won’t ever be that beast’s woman.>"
