	"description": "I possessed an extra in a reverse harem game.\n\nA moderately pretty friend, ‘she’, that made the ordinary female protagonist shine.\n\nThat was me.\n\nThe game reached the ending unharmed, and the heroine married one of her male protagonists, the Archduke of the North.\n\nAnd I got engaged to one of the poorly chosen men for the family.\n\nI thought I could live a normal life like that.\n\n“After all, you can’t replace Titi.”\n\nUntil my fiance declared that he wanted to be the mistress of the heroine who became a married woman.\n\n~*~\n\nThe new engagement was not easy.\n\nMost of the normal men were the male candidates, and all of them are in the heroine’s fishing ground.\n\n“Your Majesty, would you like to date me?”\n\nI proposed to her first love, who was the only man who refused the acts of the heroine for my acts of revenge and curiosity.\n\n“That’s an interesting proposal.”\n\n“What is your answer?”\n\n“Alright, I’ll do it. That relationship.”\n\nAll of this is my revenge against Tatiana.>"
