	"description": "The beautiful snow leopard would bite his tail whenever he’s nervous. When he was sent to the snow wolf king’s bedroom, he bit his tail tremblingly. \n\nSnow Wolf King: What are you afraid of? I wouldn’t eat you.\n\nSnow Leopard: I’m afraid you’ll XX my OO. \n\nSnow Wolf King: Then you will have to forgive me, for this king is precisely here for that reason. \n\nSnow Leopard: But I heard only the snow wolves can be queen…?\n\nSnow Wolf King: Was there such a rule? I’ll go ask a biologist. \n\nThree days later, the northern biologists expressed: Snow leopard is a type of snow wolf. \n\nLove story between cross-species demons in an impracticable setting.>"
