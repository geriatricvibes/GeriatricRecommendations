	"description": "I really died after working to death under the Duke of Alterwood.\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, it was the past, and I vowed to take revenge on the death of overwork.\r\nAs long as I'm the caretaker, the duke will die and I'll ruin the unlivable estate!\r\nI spent a lot of money on the wrong budget.\r\n\r\nI was going to leave the field to a famous boomer to ruin the farming...\r\n\r\n'This is the first time we've had such an amazing harvest, right?'\r\n'Thank you. You saved us!'\r\n\r\nStrangely, things keep going well!\r\nAnd this time, I took revenge on the duke directly.\r\n\r\n“Once you touch it, you have to take responsibility.\r\nI need you, Nelly.”\r\n\r\nIs this counterproductive? No, I still have to get revenge.\r\nDuke, please screw up!>"
