Shit, experts say the animal world is full of homosexuals, it is indeed true! He was not deceived!\n\nAnd it’s happened more than once.\n\nAfterwards, regardless of whether he was transmigrated as a lion, tiger or leopard… he would be targeted by the same sex.\n\nEven as a peacock, there will be another peacock that will spread out its tail feathers to tempt him.\n\nIs Qiao Qixi bothered by it, you ask?\n\nNo, he enjoys being fed by all the big guys.>"
