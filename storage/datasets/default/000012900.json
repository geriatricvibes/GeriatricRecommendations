	"description": "As long I met the minimum attendance for credit in my classes, I was fine.\r\nWell, I'll just study hard, go to a regular college, and become a salaryman or something, I guess...\r\nThat was the future I envisioned as I lazed around at home.\r\nBut in the spring of my last year of high school, I met you. The you, who was wild, naive, and direct with your dreams more than anyone else. I was infected by your attitude.\r\n\r\nWe, complete opposites, meet, and are instantly drawn to each other.\r\nThe two of us are torn between the delicate balance of love and the actualization of our dreams, but—\r\n\r\nFace your true self, declare goodbye to yesterday's pretense, and bloom wildly in the blue spring!>"
