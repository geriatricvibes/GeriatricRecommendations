My Grown-Up Disciple Found Out About My True Intentions And Proposed To Me~\r\n\r\nA person unreasonably kicked out from their party will develop their talents through novel encounters—after the witch Frey hears about that rumor, she decides to do just that to her beloved disciple, Tetya.\r\n\r\nTetya joined the party to become like Frey, but she wasn’t suitable for attack magic, and her growth was sluggish.\r\n\r\nAfter Frey kicks out her disciple, makes Teya cry and breaks her heart, Frey was sure she would swallow her tears and pick herself back up. Someday, when Tetya grows up with this incident as the springboard, she would come back to tell Frey, “Serves you right…!”\r\n\r\n“Master, I love you, please marry me.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n… However, Frey’s thoughts seem to be completely out of question for Tetya herself, who had grown significantly. Instead of being fooled, she decided to propose to Frey.\r\n\r\nShe invites Frey to go to the countryside, buy a store and run a magic store together, and spend the rest of their days enjoying a leisurely life.\r\n\r\nIt sounds lovely but Frey has one question.\r\n\r\nAren’t they both girls?!>"
