	"description": "Why did he fall in love with a nincompoop?\n\nBoth are born on the same year, same month, same day and they are neighbors. He had always placed her as the one and only one in his heart. But not only did she fail to realize his feelings, she even went so far as to extend her  “help”  so that he could declare his “love” for the school’s beauty queen!\n\nJust when he thought the mess was settled, the school’s “Prince Charming” decided to pursue her. Even her secret admirer from Australia flew back to join in this game of love.\n\nOh God! He just wanted a simple childhood romance. Can someone please take over the leads in this love-square?>"
