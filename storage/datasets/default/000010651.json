	"description": "Youth is not just about love. But – only this love must not be noticed.\r\n\r\n“Youth = getting a girlfriend? Youth or anything is not at all just about that.”\r\n\r\nA high school student with a trauma in love, Koga Junya, believed that youth is definitely more about making merry with friends and developing friendships than about love; that watching the beautiful starry sky, and chatting in a family restaurant till morning with the five best friends was precisely their youth.\r\n\r\n――And yet, why do we fall in love with someone even if they’re our friends? Even though we might not be able to have the same relationship as before.\r\n\r\nUpon discovering the true hidden thoughts of one of the group members, Narushima Yoru, a complicit relationship between Junya and her is born, leading them to unintentionally touch each other’s wounds.\r\n\r\nThis a youth love drama depicting straightforward and twisted feelings where friendship and love intersect.>"
