	"description": "Kurokawa Kimihiro is strongly attracted to Himeno Yukimasa, whom he knows through an American comics meet up group. Kimihiro’s desire for the man who’s twelve years older than him and head secretary at a large sales firm was first stirred by the older man’s inner strength, apparent in his upright calm and his mature masculinity, and Kimihiro succeeds in getting closer to him with an assertive approach. Convinced of his victory, he scores a kiss, but finds himself pushed down by Himeno, who puts on a manly face indeed and whispers, “Your kiss has awakened me.” … …!?
