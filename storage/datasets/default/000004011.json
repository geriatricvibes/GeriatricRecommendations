We go home together, see each other in secret, and do things we can't tell to other people.\n\nBut the second best is still the second best, so if the feeling with someone we like the most becomes mutual, then this relationship will end. We had such promise.\n\n'I'm sorry. I'm an idiot, and I keep falling for you more and more'\n\nEven though we both got close to the person we like the most, we keep on getting deep into each other, we couldn't stop, and we couldn't just let go of each other no matter what...\n\nThe result of this already unrecoverable, 100%\ndangerous, unadulterated, morbid, complicated love is.\n>"
