	"description": "From the time I met and fell in love with you until the time you met me, this is the tale of a miracle.\n\nI underwent a heart transplant when I was 13, and I’ve been dreaming about being a girl ever since.\n\nI’m sure this is the person’s recollection who became the donor.\n\nI fell in love with her right away because she was cheerful, vivacious, and happy.\n\nIt is a love that will never be reciprocated. She and I are never going to meet. We are unable to speak or touch one other. And yet—\n\nI want to meet her.\n\nI want to talk with her.\n\nI want to touch her.\n\nI want to… save her.>"
