	"description": "“Andou-kun, good morning ♪”\n\n“Asakura-san, mornin’…”\n\n(I got the seat next to the most beautiful girl in the school. A person who is willing to greet a loner like me, what a kind person she is. But in any case it’s just lip service, she’ll probably find me a bother if I start talking to her )\n\n“…”\n\n“…”\n\n(Even though I tried to greet him, why won’t he talk to meeee!! I can’t talk about light novels to anyone besides Andou-kun, so please talk to meeee!!)\n\nThis is that sort of school rom-com.\n\nSince each chapter can be read in about one minute, how about using it to take a breather from “other world things”?>"
