	"description": "He was some girl's husband-to-be, and she was in love with someone else. The two of them didn't love each other but coincidentally got together. In the night, she was his booty call, while in the day, she was just a nameless actress working for peanuts. She didn't mean to shoot to fame but endured all torment to get back everything belonging to her. He stood by and watched her going through vicissitudes of life. Every time she racked her brain to approach the goal, he resorted to all kinds of means to undermine her. He wove the illusion that he had fallen for her. However, when she finally sunk into his net, he sent her a wedding invitation. Looking at her helpless eyes, he flung a cold sentence, 'Girl, the game is over.'>"
