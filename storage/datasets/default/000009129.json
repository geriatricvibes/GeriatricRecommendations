	"description": "There was a problem from the first meeting.\n\nJi-han started playing an RPG game named ‘Zenoris’.\n\nBut the newly founded guild master is strange.\n\n[Chae Yoo: If you want to be in our guild, change your username. Either that or leave]\n\n[I’m sleepy: Do you know me? Why talk so rudely?]\n\nGuild master ‘Chae Yoo’ asks Ji-han to change his username, leading to a one-on-one confrontation.\n\nIn the confrontation, Seriousness quietly leaves.\n\n[Chae Yoo: Nim, could it be that your username in HOL be ‘I’m sleepy’ as well??]\n\n[I’m sleepy: ?? If I say yes, then what are you going to do about it…]\n\nI am leaving this guild!\n\nAfter hearing about Ji-han’s identity, Chae Yoo’s attitude changed.\n\nJi-han was embarrassed and tried to leave the guild, but\n\nThe system says it is impossible to leave for a week…\n\n“I’m sleepy, please be active in the guild.\n\nI will not force you to leave.”>"
