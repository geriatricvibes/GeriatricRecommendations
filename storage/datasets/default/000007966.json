	"description": "\n\n“You, you are mine since you signed the contract.”\n\nIsaac lived his entire life as a Beta before he became a recessive Omega at the peak of his adolescence. Four years ago, he had only one relationship with a dominant Alpha, the only experience he had as an omega. Then, while Isaac was hiding his Omega identity while running a small flower shop as a Beta, the arrogant but dazzlingly beautiful dominant Alpha Felix came in…\n\nAn unfair contract is signed between Felix, a world-renowned arms dealer and a dangerous man connected to the mafia, and Isaac, an omega dreaming to live as a normal Beta as he runs from his past.>"
