	"description": "The first time I took a plane, I don’t know what happened, but as soon as the plane took off, I fell asleep for no reason. When I woke up again, the plane that was originally full only had fifteen people left. No sign of the captain and the flight attendants. It was pure darkness outside the window, and all I could hear was the sound of the engines roaring.\n\nSuddenly, the mysterious flight announcement turned on.\n\n“Welcome aboard to the Wailing Flight, there are only fifteen people onboard, and only a few can live to get off this plane!”>"
