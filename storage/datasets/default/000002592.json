	"description": "Finally, it was their first night. \r\n\r\nLeticia whispered, leaning her forehead against his chest.\r\n\r\n'As expected, is it too far? Should I get closer?'\r\n\r\nDietrian barely swallowed a groan. His hand grasping Leticia's shoulder was shaking with a sweet faze, but she didn't notice.\r\n\r\n'I know that you’re uncomfortable. But please bear with me until my mother comes.'\r\n\r\nDietrian hated Leticia. It was natural as Leticia's mother killed his family. She had never doubted the fact.\r\n\r\nSo she didn't know, how badly his face was distorted by her words.\r\n\r\n“You just have to put up with me for half a year. Then, I will divorce you as you wish.” \r\n\r\nAt the word ‘divorce’, he gritted his teeth. \r\n>"
