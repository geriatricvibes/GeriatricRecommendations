	"description": "Mechas, spaceships, weapons, and equipment are all inseparable from energy.\n\nEnergy has become the most scarce resource in the interstellar era in the future, and even those who have awakened abilities after stimulating special genes cannot do without the supplement of energy liquid.\n\nLin Luo was originally just a small color blind miner. At best he has a good face.\n\nBut a meteor shower and a bottle of genetic enhancement liquid completely changed his fate.\n\nColor blindness is not terrible, but the terrible thing is that this color blindness can see the color of the energy stone.\n\nLin-StarCraft-No.1-Stone-Gambler-Luo: “Is it difficult to bet on stones?”\n\nEveryone: “…” It’s only not difficult for you, right?!>"
