	"description": "Hatate Souta is a high school boy, who has an ability to visualise 'flags' for future events such as 'death flag,' 'friendship flag,' and 'romance flag.' Despite the flag-viewing ability, he avoids making friends with others due to a trauma he experienced in a ship submergence accident. Twelve beautiful girls get interested in his strange way of living, and they begin to live with him at the school dorm.>"
