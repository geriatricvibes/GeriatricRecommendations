	"description": "I am Inaila, the only daughter of the Duke. I was living peacefully.\n\nOne day, I suddenly remembered my previous life. I was living inside a novel!\n\nMy fiancé, Karpel, will become a traitor in the future and will die in the Deng River while the piece of land that I’m living on is set to be destroyed by a tribal invasion!\n\nI cannot lose the engagement which was hardly set, and I can’t let go of my lavish life.\n\nThe engagement was forcefully set up even though Karpel said he hated me, but he’s only just 16 now, If I plan this well, won’t he grow up to be nice?\n\n“….I didn’t say that I dislike you.”\n\n“You look pretty today.”\n\nBoy, I thought you hated me?>"
