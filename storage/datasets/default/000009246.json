	"description": "In the haunted house, evil spirits run rampant.\r\n\r\nGu An: Husband, hug QAQ\r\n\r\nOther Players: Isn’t this person scared and stupid? Acting like a pampered brat toward the evil spirit……\r\n\r\nThen, they saw with their own eyes as the evil spirit dissipated the black qi around him, retracted his sharp blade-like claws, and gently hugged Gu An in his arms with a careful appearance, as if he had finally found the lost treasure he had been searching for for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn the secret room, evil spirits were scattered everywhere.\r\n\r\nGu An: Husband, open the door.\r\n\r\nOther Players: Is this person hallucinating? What are you daydreaming about……\r\n\r\nThen, right in front of them, the door opened!\r\n\r\nThey looked at the terrifying evil spirit as it stopped attacking, thawed its coldness, and hugged Gu An gently and preciously, as if it was embracing its entire world.\r\n\r\nOther Players: face pain QAQ\r\n\r\nAre we really not playing a game?!!>"
