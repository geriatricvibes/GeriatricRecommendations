	"description": "The young and rich Vanessa Rio Perez glimmered with happiness as she dared to hope about starting her happily ever after once she marries her dream man, Allen Travis Fajardo.\n\nBut she was wrong.\n\nHer arranged marriage with the airline heir didn’t work out. She woke up everyday to a marriage where abyss and emptiness held the reins. He grew more and more distant as every month passed by.\n\nThat provoked her to commit one mistake – a mistake that welled his heart up with hate and shattered their marriage even more.>"
