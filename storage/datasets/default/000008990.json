	"description": "When the world became a game map, and one after another, humans began to transform into dolls.\n\nIn the beginning, Bai Youwei thought it was a prank by the aliens. Until the moment where she was sucked into a vortex of light, and a clear robotic voice sounded in her ears—\n\nDing! Welcome to The Dolls’ Game! The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nIf you refuse the game, you will become a doll!\n\nIf you lose the game, you will become a doll!\n\nIf you clear the game, you will be rewarded!\n\nBai Youwei trembled while jumping into Shen Mo’s arms. “I’m scared! I’m just a weak girl who cannot tie a chicken (has no abs in hand)…” (T/N: tying a chicken and abs are homophones of (fu ji) in Chinese)\n\nShen Mo pulled her little hand and placed it on his abs. “Now you have some.”\n\nGame System: “Warning! Warning! Please respect the game, and clear challenges seriously, don’t focus on dating here!”>"
