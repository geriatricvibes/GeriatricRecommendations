	"description": "In the 21st century, she was the strongest bounty hunter who possessed supernatural powers and was proficient in brewing all types of potions. However, she becomes the first talentless child of a cultivating family when she transmigrates. \r\n\r\nHer elitist family members holds her in contempt because she cannot cultivate? In a few minutes, she cultivates a pile of mind-blowing spiritual weapons in front of their eyes. Did the woman who snatched away her husband think she's very impressive because she can cultivate? I'm sorry but even the number one medicine brewer in the continent desperately begs her to be his teacher after he sees the medicine she produces. \r\n\r\nShe is dismissed by her scumbag fiancÃ© because she can't cultivate? Hehe, her god-level cultivation skills are easily leveled up. When he regrets his decision and begs for a reconciliation? She leans in the arms of another handsome man and said disdainfully, 'Just get lost.' \r\n\r\nHowever, what happens after she accidentally opened the coffin of a vicious, yet handsome man and he decides to stick by her? She has no choice but to accommodate his wishes. \r\n\r\n[Strong male and female lead who are soulmates.]>"
