	"description": "The parallel world known as “Earth” split in two; one world was full of magic, the other possessed none. Into the first, a single man fell. “He should have been playing a game, but…” Fortunately, he retained the status of the character that he created in VRMMORPG “Another World Online”, so he did not merely just die.\r\n\r\nThree years later.\r\n\r\nHe, Takahiro Sayama, opened a ‘General Store’ in the eastern Royal Capital… he himself wants to give up, but… As for the story itself, this is a romantic comedy between him, and the girls that surround him.>"
