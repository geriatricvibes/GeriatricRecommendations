	"description": "Previously, Qin Se had shunned Gu Jingyuan. \r\n\r\nLater on, Gu Jingyuan asked her, “Wealth and power. I can give you anything you want. I just need you to marry me. Would you?” \r\n\r\nShe nodded frantically. “Yes, I will! Now let’s legalize our marriage, okay?” \r\n\r\nShe wasn’t that stupid to shove such a hotshot aside and allow others to rob him of her? \r\n\r\nAfter the marriage, Gu Jingyuan’s everyday life was simple. He helped his wife to abuse trash, was lovey-dovey, and showed affection in public! \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\nIn public, he was a crowd-puller who attracted both men and women alike—an ascetic god-like man who held the capital in the palm of his hand. \r\n\r\nBehind closed doors, only Qin Se knew the heart on Gu Jingyuan’s sleeve. This man was two-faced—beautiful on the outside but terribly wicked on the inside. \r\n\r\n>"
