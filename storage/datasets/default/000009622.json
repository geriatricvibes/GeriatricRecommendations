	"description": "Have you heard? There’s a certain kind of person in this world, who, even without any substantial contact, and with just a flash of thought, can discern a lot.\n\nTheir eyes have the ability to penetrate through to the past, to clarify the present and to break the veil of the future. They can see what you see through your eyes, smell what you smell through your nose, taste what you taste through your tongue, and can even perceive what you think through your heart.\n\nThis kind of a person is called—a psychic.\n\nA story about the awakening of a ‘guabi’, who is merely plodding through life, from his deep slumber. (*guabi, a slang term, meaning ‘dead idiot’ = people who are penniless and jobless)>"
