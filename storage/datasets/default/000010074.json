	"description": "A long time later, I began to understand the value of a golden palace.\n\nIf Wei Zifu loved you, then her story could only have ended the way mine did.\n\nPeople often said that the limits of love lay in one’s ability to endure – to endure the fact that the man we loved would have three wives and four concubines.\n\nWei Zifu managed to tolerate. So, she accompanied you by your side for thirty-eight years.\n\nShe could accomplish this because she did not love you.\n\nAll along, what she wanted was never love.\n\nIf, from the beginning, all I wanted was only the precious throne belonging to an Empress, perhaps I would not have lost you as quickly as I had.\n\nNote: This oneshot narrates the true story between Emperor Han Wudi (Liu Che) and his first wife, the deposed Empress Chen Jiao. Their story has been encapsulated into a famous chinese idiom called “金屋藏娇” (jīn wū cáng jiāo), which literally means ‘putting (Chen) Jiao into a golden house’.>"
