	"description": "I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.\n\n“Sister, what is ‘that’?”\n\n“That’ is your friend. Didn’t you say you wanted a friend?”\n\nOne day, my sister brought home a man.\n\nThe fact that she brought home a man alone is shocking but what’s more shocking is that this man… is someone who has lost his memories after being chased by the Imperial Palace. This man is someone who was a child during the day but a man at night.\n\nThe man is none other than the cursed magician ‘Lennox Iberich.’\n\n“I think I should continue getting hurt.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Then, Amy will continue to be by my side.”\n\nWhy is this man dangerous?\n\nEven though during the day, he’s a lovely and cute puppy,\n\n“You like my naked body, huh?”\n\n“Wait a minute, can’t you say it properly? It’s a misunderstanding!”\n\n“Why is it a misunderstanding? Didn’t you touch my body? You didn’t even give me any clothes.”\n\n“That is true but the reason why I didn’t…”\n\n“So you do like me naked.”\n\n“No, I said no!”\n\nAt night, he’s a wild and dangerous wolf.>"
