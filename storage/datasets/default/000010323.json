	"description": "Xia Weiwei had been in love with Luo Chejue for over eight years, and married to him for two. However, instead of a happy marriage, all she got was cruel torture. The man she had loved with her whole heart watched her struggle coldly and caused her the loss of her child… Siting in her wheelchair and forcing a smile at the dark muzzle of the gun, she felt that her heart had been torn to pieces.>"
