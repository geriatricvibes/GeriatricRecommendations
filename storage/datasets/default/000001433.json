	"description": "A heroine character transmigrates and gets busy expanding her golden halo of MC-ness.\n\nA villainess character transmigrates and gets busy changing her cannon-fodder fate.\n\nA side character transmigrates and gets busy stuffing her bottomless stomach. She holds a divine sword in one hand and a little bun in the other. She’s obedient, adorable, incredibly clueless, and frustratingly tightfisted with her words. So what does she do when she spies a cute blond?\n\nFeng Wu: “Please marry me!” \n\nMing Xi: …\n\nA hilarious story about an overpowered airhead in a world reminiscent of Coiling Dragon. This particular tale has an interesting mash of tropes.>"
