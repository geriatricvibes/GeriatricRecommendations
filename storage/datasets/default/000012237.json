	"description": "“….Krische-sama, are you not afraid of killing people?”\n\n“……? No. After all, it doesn’t hurt Krische.”\n\nAlthough gifted with the talent to do anything with ease, the girl lacked empathy.\n\nIn her world, there is only loss and profit. No goodwill, no love.\n\nInhumanly recognizing cold, mathematical logic as everything, she looks at everything in the world through calculating lens.\n\nReturn given profit with profit, loss with loss.\n\nThe girl was undoubtedly pure, yet undeniably abnormal—\n\nHer favorite things are cooking, food, and being pampered.\n\nHer specialty is murder.\n\n—- This is the story of a slightly unhinged girl being surrounded by kind and loving people, and her journey to find happiness.>"
