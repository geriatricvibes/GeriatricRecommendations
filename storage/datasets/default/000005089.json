	"description": "When other people experience a body transformation, it is inevitably either male to female or female to male.\n\nMe? I wake up to find myself transformed into two different bodies.\n\nBoth a male body and a female body, one conscience operating two bodies, all sorts of embarrassing moments.\n\nWalking together normally makes other people think that I am sweethearts with my other-self, such sadness.\n\nAlso, the entire business of a hero rescuing the beautiful maiden, I call Bull.\n\nI get slashed by a sword and my female body gets abducted, and he wants me to thank him?!?! Can it be less of a tragedy?>"
