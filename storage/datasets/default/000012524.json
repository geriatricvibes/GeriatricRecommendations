	"description": "The imperial family collapsed in one night. By Basilisk, the summoner of darkness; summoned by Fletta, the Cursed Princess.\r\n\r\n'If there is a next life... Can I really be your sister?'\r\n\r\nWould it have been different if I had approached you a little more?\r\n\r\nIt was the last time everyone regretted it, and like a miracle, time returned to six years ago. If this is the second chance given to us...\r\n\r\n'Yes, I'll heal you. To prevent the awakening of the Basilisk's darkness.’\r\n\r\nSo I decided.\r\n\r\n'I look forward to your kind cooperation, Grand Duke Darian. No, Kylia.'\r\n\r\nI decided to marry Fletta's maternal uncle, Grand Duke Kylia.\r\n\r\nI thought there would be no problem because it was a one-year contract marriage.\r\n\r\n'Honey, ah, try it.'\r\n\r\n'You have no idea how much I like you.'\r\n\r\n'I will continue to like you. I want to express my affection to my heart's content... Can't I?'\r\n\r\nWhat’s wrong with this guy?\r\n\r\nWhen I try to save Fletta, the Grand Duke comes along with me (?) \r\n\r\nAren’t you the Monster Grand Duke…?>"
