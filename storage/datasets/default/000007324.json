After his rebirth, he had become the supertr*sh of the Ye family and had to suffer from disgrace. To make matters worse, he had an argument with his fiancé that had led to the breaking off of their engagement. In this second life, he will work hard to change his destiny and vows to return to the peak of the world, trampling on those who had mocked him and rewrite his legacy!>"
