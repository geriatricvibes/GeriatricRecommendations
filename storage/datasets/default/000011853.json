She was abandoned to a peasant family by her biological parents again?\n\nIt was time to cry this time!\n\nSo what if it were a peasant family? As long as her heart was set, she could still lead the splendid life that she wanted!\n\nHowever, she was not prepared for what lay ahead of her. Because of a secret which she accidentally overheard, she was forced by an unscrupulous young neighbor to leave her foster parents and hometown together with him. Since then, her future was accompanied by challenges and things kind of sidetracked from what she had planned.>"
