	"description": "Ahelissa Seraf, a traitor who became a helper of the tyrant.\n\n“Your parents abandoned you. So forget about it and live.”\n\nShe grew up as an orphan in the Pelanders, the assassination guild of the Kingdom of Lobel. However, Ahelissa, who had grown into an adult, ignored their warning. She left her home as an independent woman to search for her parents who had abandoned her. Instead, she finds an injured man in an alley near her house and helps, and unable to turn her gaze from the pitiful lad, she offers a helping hand.\n\nThe man was none other than the most powerful in the Kingdom of Lobel. The king.\n\n“There’s something I want to check.” The man caressed her skin with his calloused hands and whispered, “I wish you could come with me to my palace. That’s my suggestion.” He was acting peculiar, spouting dangerous suggestions.\n\nIt was stranger that Ahelissa couldn’t find herself rejecting his proposal.>"
