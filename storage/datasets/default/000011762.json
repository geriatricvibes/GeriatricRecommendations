	"description": "To save my elder brother, I gave up all of my light elemental powers. When my father (His Majesty) knew I lost my powers, I was stripped of my status as a prince and sent away to a Marquisate. [I was able to save my brother so I don’t mind].\n\nBut why did my brother, who came along with me to the Marquisate, say “I want to sleep in the same bed”, does he miss the company of others?>"
