	"description": "Although she was an innocent woman who did not know the world, Rowena fell into a love trap and became the mistress of Duke Killian.\r\nShe devoted her body and mind to him for three years, but she was thrown away with repeated contempt and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nOne day she secretly gave birth to his child and lived in hiding like a sinner.\r\nAfter five years, he returned like nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\n'long time no see. Miss Philone.”\r\n“… … Don't you remember throwing money at me and throwing me away?”\r\n“I throw it away, so I have to pick it up.”\r\n\r\nKillian smiled, responding lightly. The cold eyes turned to the door where the child was hiding.\r\n\r\n“I didn't expect that you would be so quick, but in the meantime, it must have been sweet.”\r\n“… … .”\r\n“Choose. Miss Philone.”\r\n\r\nA man who lifted my cheeks with a glance of appreciation of the object reported.\r\n\r\n'Will you be my mistress again, or will you die with your child on the street?”>"
