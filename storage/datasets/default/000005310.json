	"description": "With an F-rank Trait, deemed the worst of the worst, 5-year old Shin Yu-sung is abandoned by the Shin-oh family, which is famous for raising hunters.\r\n\r\nThe same year, he meets one of the strongest hunters, the Fist King, at the orphanage and is adopted by him.\r\n\r\nThe Fist King became the strongest not through his Trait or special abilities — but by training his body.\r\n\r\nHe takes note of Shin Yu-sung’s physique instead of his Trait—\r\n\r\nNine blocked yin pathways.\r\n“Your blocked pathways cause your body’s mana to overflow, giving you an exceptional mind and god-like looks! But you also pass away before coming of age…”\r\n\r\nAn abundance of bodily yang.\r\n“Your body is overflowing with the energy that can cure your nine blocked yin pathways!”>"
