	"description": "Su Yan, as a really good citizen, was unfathomably chosen by a system suddenly one day.\r\n\r\nSu Yan: Why me???\r\n\r\nSir System: Because you are a good woman.\r\n\r\nSuYan: #%*...\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Su Yan traversed various worlds, white-washing all sorts of bad women. But...why is it that she was always eaten cleanly by lord male lead? What happened to aloof and self-restrained? What happened to staying away from sensuality? What happened to hating me? I just wanted to white-wash only!\r\n\r\nThe female lead ceaselessly transmigrates, white-washing all sorts of bad women, but always getting pushed down by the male lead...(novel is slightly Mary Sue, the plot serves the smut)>"
