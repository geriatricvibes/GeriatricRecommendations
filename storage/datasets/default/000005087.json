	"description": "This time it’s going to be a pure research mage who has no combat ability\n\nGong (Aldin) is good and evil. He is not a good person. Of course, he is certainly not a villain. On the surface he is straightforward, but actually he is shrewd and a little bit reserved. \n\nShou (Dong Ji) Is a pure researcher. He has a kind personality and is gentle. He is afraid of this and afraid of that. He lacks courage. He hopes that someone can protect him and only wants to have a stable environment to do research.\n\nIt’s a traditional fantasy background, but the story itself is relatively low-magic. It can be said that it is very low-magic, not high.\n\nIt’s a kind of trivial story, mainly based on the circumstances of the characters, not the kind of legendary epic fantasy.>"
