	"description": "I’m supposed to be a normal high school girl, but now I have big black bat-like wings on my back.\r\nI’m not wearing a costume. I can’t take it off even if I pull it off.\r\nA person wearing a white hooded cloak is standing in front of me.\r\n“I’m here for you.”\r\nThe person in the cloak extends his hand toward me.\r\n“Where are you going?”\r\nI asked fearfully.\r\n“To the world where you were born.”\r\nWhat does he mean?\r\nNo, no, I’m Japanese.\r\n\r\nA high school girl is taken to a world guarded by spirits as a wind maiden who breaks the seal of the temple’s wind mirror, and travels with the queen, king, and priests of that world to save the demon-infested kingdom of the wind.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of another continent in the world of the story of the Black and Silver Wolves.>"
