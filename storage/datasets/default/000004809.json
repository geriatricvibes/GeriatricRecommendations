	"description": "I was a popular actress before I came into this world and became Emilone, a Saintess. I was given the nickname “lady who moved dimension.” \n\nEven so, I did not receive any special attention. All attention was on Princess Ronella Nestro.  \n\nAs a result, I decided to devote my life to being a Saintess.\n\nOne day, I accidentally discovered the Princess’ secret. The Princess’ innocent and good-natured personality was all an act!\n\n“This might be interesting.”\n\nI may be able to break up my boring routine if I get closer to Princess Ronella. \n\nI decided to make a dangerous decision for fun.>"
