	"description": "Shun Tachibana, a math teacher and enthusiast, was someone who prided himself on being perfectly on the straight and narrow. Until one day, he awakened in a fantasy, otome game.\r\n\r\nHowever, the heroine did not appear, and for some reason, Shun is repeatedly treated to kabedons and spell-like, pick up lines from the princes instead.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more; he doesn’t even have a cheat skill, one of the most important things for reincarnating in another world! He then visits Craig, a former prince, for the sake of his survival, but it turns out Craig is a wolf. On a certain full moon night, Shun is attacked by him while he is in his estrous phase. After finding out about Craig’s situation, Shun offered to continue to “help” Craig through his estrous cycles.>"
