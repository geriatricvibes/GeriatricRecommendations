	"description": "Lin Jin never imagined he would ever transmigrate. And to such a peculiar world at that. Here, deadly beasts were regarded as sacred, and thankfully, he owned a museum for deadly beasts. \r\n\r\n“Master, this is just a dying little tortoise…” \r\n\r\n“What tortoise? This is a rare species that contains the blood of a Black Tortoise and could be promoted up to level seven.” \r\n\r\n“What about this shedding mongrel?” \r\n\r\n“Mongrel? How narrow-minded. This is a branch descendant of the snarling hound with a hint of Kirin’s blood. Take my word for it and sign the blood contract at once. I guarantee you that you'll soar to success and be on your path to invincibility!”>"
