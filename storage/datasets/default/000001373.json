However, after coming out of his death seclusion, he realized that everything had changed. \r\n\r\nHe had received a Passive System with many strange, miraculous passive skills: \r\n\r\nHe would become stronger with every breath. \r\n\r\nHe would become stronger when he got attacked. \r\n\r\nHe would become stronger when he got mocked… \r\n\r\nXu Xiaoshou was forced to shout, “Oh God, I don’t want to be like this either. Everything I did was because I was being forced to! I am so passive!”>"
