	"description": "The life of the court’s jester is arduous. Every day, matching the palate of fallen nobles, And becoming the object of the King’s venting.\n\nNow, I walk on a tightrope between the two Princesses. The First Princess, eternally my Lord. And the Second Princess, still too young and innocent. \n\n“I have never, in my life, imagined that I wouldn’t be King.\nI can’t forgive you for blocking my path forward right now.”\n\nBut that child is barely ten, isn’t she? \n\n“It is an undeniable fact that I’m a political enemy that threatens the throne.”\n\nJesters are supposed to protect the innocence of children, always.\n\n“I swear to God, the child’s existence will surely be erased.”\n\nPrincess,\nThe allegiance dedicate to you has the scent of blood. \nBut the moon that I had gazed with you,\nHow could it have been so beautiful?\n\nTwo Princesses,\nAnd one throne.\n\nIs this story a comedy or a tragedy?>"
