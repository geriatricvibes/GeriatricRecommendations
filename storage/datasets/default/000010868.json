	"description": "I suspect that I’m crazy.\n\nCrazy. Insane. Mad. However you want to put it. And I mean the type where there’s really something wrong with me, something uncontrollable and life-ruining and in my brain, in my blood, and not just that I’m a little weird or have an overdramatic, rash personality. I suspect I have schizophrenia, OCD, depression and other mental illnesses. \n\nBut there's a gangster stutterbug that won’t even take mercy on a crazy person, oh my god. Where are his morals?\n\n–—-\n\nEver since I first met Xue Yaozu at the karaoke parlour where I work part-time, I started seeing him all the time. This self-proclaimed ‘old classmate’ definitely has some hidden, nefarious motive up his sleeves!\n\nWhy else would he ask about my job, where I live, and even if he can help me??? Not to mention the fact that he keeps trying to assure me that he’s not a bad guy! Sus! So sus!!!! Red alarms blaring type of sus!!>"
