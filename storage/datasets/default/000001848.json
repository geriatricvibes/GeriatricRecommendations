	"description": "Universal Century 0093. Char Aznable, who had gone missing, revives the Neo Zeon Forces and wages war against the Earth Federation government. To change the climatic conditions he’ll drop a meteoroid onto Earth, carried out in order to create an artificial ice age. Many innocent people would be purged at the hand of Char… Amuro Ray, a former rival, stands in the way of Char’s ambitions once again! The original version of the anime’s spectacular masterpiece, Char’s Counterattack!\r\n\r\nThe original modified Hi Streamer storyline proposed by Tomino for the Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack movie was rejected and released instead as a novel. While both Beltorchika's Children and the Char's Counterattack movie are based on the same reference material, an Animage novel serial called Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack - Hi Streamer (April 1987 - May 1988), there are notable differences. >"
