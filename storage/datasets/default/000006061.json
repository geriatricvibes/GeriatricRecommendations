	"description": "“Old Tang, you activated speed-related Genetic Base Points. What’s the direction of those Base Points?” \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis question caused Tang Ting to have a melancholic expression. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“It’s… Hand speed…” “And the right hand at that!” \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nXu Tui slipped onto a daze. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHand speed and the right hand. This image… \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDidn’t the teacher say that it was easier to activate the Base Points of the areas you use the most? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Old Tang, just what do you use your hands for?” \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“According to that explanation, did I activate the Genetic Base Points in my stomach because I’ve eaten 18 year’s worth of meals?” Cheng Mo, who was on his way to becoming a glutton, looked up and sighed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nXu Tui stroked his head, “Could it be because I’ve used my brain for 18 years?”>"
