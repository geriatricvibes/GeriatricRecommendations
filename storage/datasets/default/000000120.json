	"description": "Lu Lingxi died.\n\nAs a child born by his parents through precise genetic matching, for eighteen years of his life, he lived entirely for his brother, who had leukaemia. He was his brother’s shadow, a “medicine reserve bank” for his brother’s treatment needs.\n\nUmbilical cord blood, stem cells, bone marrow… whenever his brother needed it, he would have no choice but to quietly lie on the operating table.\n\nUntil the last time, when his brother needed a kidney and he never came off the operating table.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes again, Lu Lingxi became a teenager with the same name Lu Lingxi.\n\nFreed from the shackles of his fate, he possesses the mysterious ability to communicate with plants.\n\nRaising flowers, gardening and running a farm, Lu Lingxi begins a very different life!>"
