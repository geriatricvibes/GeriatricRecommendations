	"description": "Cosmetician Mi Chen started her career in the entertainment circle after returning from abroad, where she met the best actors Bai Yihan and Li Mojun.\r\n\r\nBefore she knew well about them, she thought Bai was gentle and humble while Li precise and cool…\r\n\r\nIt turned that both the elegant idols who stole thousands of millions of girls’ heart were nuts…\r\n\r\nWhere on earth had the so-called modest and aloof gentlemen been?\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nBai vs. Li, “…Since we’ve come to this far, whoever makes Mi Chen figure out our feelings for her first…will win.”\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nIn the end, she kissed him.\r\n\r\nRight, the moment she stepped in front of his poster, he had become her only male lead forever.>"
