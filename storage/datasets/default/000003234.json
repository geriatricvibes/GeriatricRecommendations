	"description": "Lynn’s soul has been transferred over to another world! What more, his father, a noble, has disowned him because his mother is a servant. Luckily, Lucy, Lynn’s fiance, has a mother who is more than willing to give him land in order to test his abilities. If he can prove his worth as a Lord, then he would be able to inherit her title of Earl. What nobody knows is that Lynn has a wealth of knowledge and experience from his previous world, and a cheat-like ability to create loyal half beast warriors by spending System points. Lynn is also never in a rush to do anything, as he believes it is a matter of time before everything falls into his hands. Read Lynn’s journey as he onesidedly takes out his opponents in a calm and collected manner befitting of a king.>"
