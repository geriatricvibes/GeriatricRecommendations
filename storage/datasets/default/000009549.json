	"description": "It’s been ten years since this world was connected to another world. The world has changed a lot with the appearance of dungeons and real gods.\n\nA change also came to me, the day after I quit my job after I got pissed off at my boss. In the mirror, I saw something odd. It was etched on my neck. An imprint.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that is constantly being featured on TV. Those who receive blessings from those otherworldly gods will have a mark engraved onto their necks. It looks like I got the blessing too. The blessing of the Evil God.\n\nThe god who gave me the blessing was very twisted! Thanks to his blessings, I can easily get rare drops by killing the monsters with ill-natured moves. While swearing at others, I’m going to be the strongest!>"
