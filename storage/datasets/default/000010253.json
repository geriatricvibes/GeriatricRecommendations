After we marry, I will earn money to support the family and you can be a full time cook and take care of the children. But who would have known you had this kind of identity.\n\n……what else can I say.\n\nThe man calmly smiled: I think your idea is feasible.\n\nZu Jin: Slips away~\n\nStraightforward tyrant and workaholic female president vs virtuous cook, husband, and black-bellied boss>"
