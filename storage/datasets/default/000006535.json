	"description": "Giulio Parenti, who was deprived of his life by Yuri Petrov, was wounded in body and mind. \r\n\r\nHe meets Lee Ha-na, a dangerous woman who intentionally approaches to save his younger brother, who is in danger due to his colleague’s betrayal…\r\n\r\n“Ciao.”\r\n\r\nThe man tilted his head and stared at her. To be precise, he stared at the muzzle and the black eyes beyond it.\r\n\r\n“If you come any closer… I will kill you.”\r\n\r\n“Coreano?”\r\n\r\n“Si, come no.”\r\n\r\nThe man put his hand in his pocket and slowly made eye contact with one knee on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe brought his forehead to the aimed gun and gently grabbed her wrist.\r\n\r\nShe struggled to raise the corners of her mouth and quietly recited the man's name.\r\n\r\n“Julio Parenti.”\r\n\r\nGiulio Parenti's voice, who was staring at her lips with narrowed eyes, was as cold as ice.\r\n\r\n“Ho aspettato. La mia morte.”\r\n\r\nThe breath she had held in slowly released.\r\n\r\nHe's a devil with the face of an angel. \r\n\r\nOr was it a monster?\r\n>"
