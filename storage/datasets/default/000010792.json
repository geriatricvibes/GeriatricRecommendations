	"description": "The protagonist, Shuhei Jinnai, is heartbroken when a fellow club member lies to him about his love life, and reveals the truth to him. Due to his distrust of women and his family circumstances, he was unable to find any enjoyment in life, quit the club, and lived his life with a cold heart.\r\n\r\nThe one person who gets involved in Shuhei’s life is Chizuru Hase, a junior member of the club he left.\r\n\r\n“Senpai! Why aren’t you coming to the club!?”\r\n\r\nHe is annoyed by the junior who keeps getting involved with him, and returns the favor with a salty attitude, but she never learns.\r\n\r\n“I understand that you’re shocked that it was a lie, but you don’t have a great face to begin with. Why don’t you just find yourself a new girlfriend? Ah, isn’t it impossible in Senpai’s case?”\r\n\r\nShuhei reacts unintentionally to Chizuru’s agitation and approaches her with vigor.\r\n\r\n“...Then you should deal with me.”\r\n\r\n“...Eh?”\r\n\r\nThe two of them are forced into a physical relationship through this exchange.\r\n\r\nWhat awaits the two of them when things start to go sideways......>"
