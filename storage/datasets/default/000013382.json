	"description": "One fateful day, a girl time slipped into the Sengoku Era.\r\n\r\nIt was an abrupt enough event to be dubbed god’s whim, done to sate hellish boredom.\r\n\r\nThe girl has no power to change the world.\r\n\r\nShe was a very ordinary, common, and plain girl that can be found anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd that girl can do no more than a single thing.\r\n\r\nSurvive the Sengoku Era ——– that’s all.>"
