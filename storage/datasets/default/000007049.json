	"description": "Roar, she really hates him. Not only did he grab her first place in the class but also as if speaking to a beggar, says he will give her the scholarship.\n\nNo matter how poor she is, she will not accept such humiliating “kindness”! They obviously are classmates for a year, each keeping to themselves. His sudden interest in her rose.
