	"description": "Du Yixin, on the shelf since birth, twenty years now and counting, dreams of one day finding a cute girlfriend. Unfortunately for him, before he finds one, he is transported into an unfamiliar, abandoned high school.\n\nIt’s late; dark. There doesn’t seem to be anybody around, but an announcement comes——\n[School is now over. Students, please do not loiter and immediately leave. The teacher on duty, begin your rounds immediately]\n\nWhat he did not expect, however, was that the scariest thing was not the game’s boss, but the man who chopped the boss up and then turned against the players.\n\nDu Yixin “And yet, he still submitted to my amazing character, and decided to become my lackey.”\n\nYing Sheng, narrowing his eyes, “Lackey?”\n\nDu Yixin “… Boyfriend.”\n\nYing Sheng “Hmph.”\n\nDu Yixin “Darling~”\n\nYing Sheng, blushing “shut up!”>"
