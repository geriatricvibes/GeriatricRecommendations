	"description": "He Lanzhi never dreamed that he could actually transmigrate inexplicably just by taking a nap at home. \n\nThe same transmigration, others are transmigrated as imposing and domineering figures such as emperors, generals, and heroes. \n\nAnd him? He turned into a weak as wind, treacherous prime minister! Weak as the wind! ! It was even a treacherous prime minister who brought harm to the country and the people! ! With a physical fitness that is tr*sh, don’t provoke hatred indiscriminately, Lord Prime Minister! Leaving a bunch of mess and letting go, don’t leave such a pit.\n\n He Lanzhi wanted to cry but had no tears. \n\nJust what trouble did he do in his past life to transmigrate into this hard to swallow prime minister and almost dying after crossing over.>"
