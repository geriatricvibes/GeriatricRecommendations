	"description": "The Mizuki Diving Club (MDC) is facing hard times, with a decline in membership and public disinterest in the sport of diving causing its parent company to threaten to shut it down. Just when things are looking bleak, a mysterious new coach by the name of Asaki Kayoko arrives and strikes a deal with the company: If the club can send one diver to the Olympics next year, then they must keep the club open. Sakai Tomoki had always loved diving, but now he, along with his teammates, must work harder than they ever had before in order to fulfill that condition.>"
