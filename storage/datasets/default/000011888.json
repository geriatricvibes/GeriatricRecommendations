	"description": "This book is Jiang Yingliu’s memoir, which narrates Liu’er life from Beauty to Empress in the palace. Under the plain sentences lies the difficult life in the palace for more than 50 years. Inside the palace, everyone is pitiful. The author describes the majority of “my” life in the palace after “I” accidentally entered the palace in first-person perspective and shows a different life in the imperial harem. Rather than intrigue and contention, the life here is quite peaceful and happy. Finally, I wish them reincarnate as civilians next life and never enter the palace again as they wished.\n\nPink hands so fine,\nGold-branded wine,\nSpring paints the willows green \npalace walls can’t confine.\nEast wind unfair,\nHappy times rare.　　\nIn my heart sad thoughts throng;　　\nWe severed for years long.　　\nWrong, wrong, wrong!　　\nSpring is as green,　\nIn vain she’s lean,　　\nHer kerchief soaked with tears and red with stains unclean.　　\nPeach blossoms fall　　\nNear deserted hall.　　\nOur oath is still there. Lo!　　\nNo word to her can go. 　　\nNo, no, no!>"
