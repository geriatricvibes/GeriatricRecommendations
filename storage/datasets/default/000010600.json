	"description": "Takumi wakes up on a ship. He wakes up in a different world that looks just like the world of the RPG fantasy game, “Change the World”!\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, even if he’s going to be transferred to another world, why is it this precarious world filled with death flags? What, join the Blackwing Knights they say? But I’m just an ordinary person? Isn’t there something off about how they’re treating me?\r\n\r\nThis is a story about a protagonist who is misunderstood by overprotective knights while adventuring in another world.>"
