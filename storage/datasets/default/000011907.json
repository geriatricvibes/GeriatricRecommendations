	"description": "On the desolate barren planet of Rennes, an Asian teenager named Lin Yuan receives an admission notice for the Empire’s best military academy San Romia. So begins his life changing military school career.\n\nLin Yuan: Wow! This school’s really great! Everyone even has a separate bedroom! But…why does my next door roommate always knock on my door? And all day long he keeps bothering me, God! So annoying!\n\nLin Yuan: I’m a Beta, my biggest wish is to meet a nice Beta girl, get married, have children and live in peace! Wait a minute… Why does my body suddenly feel strange? Why does this medicine look like drugs to prevent Omega from entering estrus?\n\nTrembling in his roommate’s arms Lin Yuan blushes and tries to push off his chest: “Wait…wait a minute…I’ve always thought of you as a friend. Don’t do this…..ah….”\n\nAt that moment, Lin Yuan seems to feel that the universe has malicious plans for him. The world is collapsing, who will tell him why the script is so wrong?>"
