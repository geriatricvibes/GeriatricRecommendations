	"description": "She had no choice when she became the mistress of a CEO. It was not for money, nor for desire, but fate. But she had to fall for the guy next door; after all, he was good at everything from taking care of a home to taking care of kids! After she fell in love, she realized he was already engaged. And he was the brother-in-law of the CEO. How could she have seen the ploy? What can I do when my jaded heart melts? When the hate I’ve held onto for ten years is gone, what do I do? When you said you’d wait for me, I was so touched. . . When everything is past and I look back, your determination makes my heart seem ridiculous.>"
