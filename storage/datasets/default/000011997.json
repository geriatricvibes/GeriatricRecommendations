	"description": "'Romé, no, Countess Romélia. I can no longer do this with you. I am breaking off our engagement. We will part as soon as I return to my country.'\r\n\r\nPrince Henri announced this to me while I was still rejoicing the long-awaited defeat of Zergis, the Demon King.\r\n\r\nBut the prince did not know, I have the miraculous power of 'Grace'. \r\n\r\nThis is a re-published version of the previously published Romélia Senki: The engagement was broken when the Demon King was defeated.>"
