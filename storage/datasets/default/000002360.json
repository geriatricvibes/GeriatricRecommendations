	"description": "Married rich for three years with no child born. Just when she was finally cured of infertility and ready to give him a child, he brought home his pregnant mistress in high profile. \n\n“Get lost if you can’t get knocked up. Or do you want my son to be the last of the Mo family?” her mother-in-law viciously cursed. \n\nHer husband grimly shoved a divorce agreement upon her face, “I’ve signed. Leave when you are ready.”\n\nIt was heard later that two men went physical in the city plaze of Ye City to win back the wife, with the two babies at the side fighting fiercely for their mom!>"
