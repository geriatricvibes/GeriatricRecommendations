	"description": "“Exciting battles! The Great War in the School of Love”, or more commonly known as “Exciting! School of Love”. It was a maiden game… and a “legendary sh*tty game” that was well known for its failure as an otome game because all the capture targets are fools. \n\nThis game made me, Rika Todo, feel cheated. But after I played it, I realized that I had been reincarnated into its world. But instead of becoming the villain, I was a mob character, the Duke’s daughter, Alice Salbert!\n\nI don’t know what to do because I have too little information on Alice. However, I eventually come to realize… If the capture targets are bumbling fools like the characters in the game, this country will surely fall apart ( gasps ). And if that happens, I, as the duchess, will be in danger as well.　\n\nTime for some education! I’m going to educate these a**holes and make sure this country survives!\n\nThis is a story about a woman who gets reincarnated in the world of a sh*tty game as a ducal daughter of this country. While educating the elite, she eventually becomes known as the Treasured Mother of the Kingdom… but she still has targets to capture. It’s a story of one conquest after another… maybe.>"
