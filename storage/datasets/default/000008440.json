	"description": "The price of a love that shouldn’t have been possible was terrible ruin. \r\n\r\nSierra prayed when she lost everything that was precious to her.\r\n\r\n“Please, let me make a different choice this time.”\r\n\r\nSo time was reversed and Sierra is once again at the crossroad of choices. \r\n\r\nShe went back to the time she spent the first night with her beloved. \r\n\r\nIn her womb, there was their child who was coldly erased in the past before going back in time.\r\n\r\n‘I can’t be with him.’\r\n\r\nTheir relationship in the past was full of despair, but Sierra wanted to save the child who was fruit of their love.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to leave a single trace of the child.”\r\n\r\nSo eight years after Sierra disappeared from the Empire, the love she once had to leave behind had returned.>"
