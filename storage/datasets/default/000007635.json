	"description": "This is one of the first web novels in China. It mixed Xuanhuan and Wuxia together and inspired a lot of followers. A special thing about this story is that the supporting characters in it are very lively. Each and every one of them has their own way of thinking and feasible reasons to do what they must. The trade off is that the MC will be a weaker point (still pretty awesome actually). Some of the supporting characters will even have a prequel or squeal. This novel also has some of the best fighting scenes. The author is a talent at describing scenes and character building. The humorous atmosphere make it easy to read, while something a little deep and dark hide inside.>"
