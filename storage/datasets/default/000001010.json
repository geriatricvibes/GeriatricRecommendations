	"description": "I am the youngest of two twins. My sister is pretty like an angel, and our parents have always treated us differently. Just the other day, it was decided that my sister is the miko, a child loved by god, and she was taken away along with our parents.\n\nMe? I was abandoned, but I’m probably the miko.>"
