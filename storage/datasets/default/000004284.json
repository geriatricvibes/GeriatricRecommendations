	"description": "'It's my first time. I'm afraid of pain. Be gentle…' Fang Xinxin's body is stiff with anxiety. \r\n\r\nBai Qinghao pinches her dotingly. 'We're just swimming. I didn't pull you with too much force; how did you manage to flop into the water like that?' \r\n\r\nIn their previous life, she had been overweight. Her face was covered in acne. Yet, he still forcefully ate her up. Exactly how much did he love her? However, she never noticed his sincerity and blindly pursued a scheming bastard. In the end, she was left blind and half-paralyzed. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving a second chance, she finally understands that her poor appearance was caused by the 'drugs' her sister had added into her skincare products. In this lifetime, she chooses to distance herself away from the bastard, to lose weight, and to 'treat' her face. She recovers her seductive figure and outstanding looks, treasuring her husband's love. They then sweetly collaborate to torture the bastard and give birth to a little 'dumpling'…>"
