	"description": "The male lead from a romance-fantasy novel, he’s a war fanatic. People call him ‘Demon’, a nickname filled with awe and fear. And I reincarnated as his wife.\n\nIf there’s a problem is that as soon as the original work starts, I was murdered as the ‘Wicked Previous Wife’ together with my own blood-related daughter.\n\nMy daughter that’s slated to die with me is a 5-years-old kid who’s boundlessly cute, while my husband is good-looking but scary.\n\nI tried this and that to fix my bad-personality husband. But for me who isn’t the female lead, fixing his personality is impossible.\n\nAll right! First, I’m going to take my daughter and run away. Let’s think about the future after.>"
