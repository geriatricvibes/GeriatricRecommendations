	"description": "Edward was reincarnated and lived freely as the third prince of the peaceful island nation of Astraea, but his life changed drastically with the appearance of a saint summoned by a goddess.\r\n\r\nThe saint, whose mental state manifests in the form of weather, has chosen Edward, a simple man, to be her caretaker instead of his more handsome brothers…\r\n\r\nIt was not only troublesome but also a great responsibility to take care of a saint who keeps abandoning the mission given to her by the goddess, crying, and making it rain all the time!\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her why she was crying, she replied, “My boyfriend died!”\r\n\r\nBut, I know she wouldn't cry for that reason.\r\n\r\nBecause that dead boyfriend was me in a previous life.\r\n\r\n>"
