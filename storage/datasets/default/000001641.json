	"description": "It was just the usual night for Suho, nothing out of the ordinary. On his computer, he was casually surfing the internet until he came across a link for a certain survey. If it was any other day, he wouldn’t have clicked on it, much less completed it, but for some reason this time, he just did.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he went to bed, ending the night in just the usual way…but he would end up waking to a whole new world; a place of fantasies, full of magic. He would awake to this new life of his, with a new name: Mark.>"
