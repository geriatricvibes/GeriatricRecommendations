Too bad. I thought Shana would marry me, so I set up a ring in advance.'\r\n\r\nHave I even tamed even my brother's friend, the Male Lead, as a bonus?\r\nBut the problem did not end there.\r\n\r\nOn Coming-of-Age Night, I only remember drinking alone in the corner.….\r\n\r\n'We should take responsibility for what you and I did, right?'\r\n\r\n Why is the Male Lead, the Duke's, waking up in the same bed as me?>"
