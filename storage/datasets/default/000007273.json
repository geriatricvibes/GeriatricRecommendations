	"description": "Mr. Zheng (top) who stands at 186cm has liked women with fair skin and big boobs for 30 years. Out of nowhere, he found himself in love with the bronzed-skinned and flat-chested Mr. Yuan (bottom) who stands at 189cm. From then on, he started his lovey-dovey life with shoe insoles.\n\nMr. Yuan has been single for 27 years and has had countless one-sided crushes that never worked out. Finally, he met his true love, Mr. Zheng. But, Mr. Zheng was a chest fanatic (purely liked rubbing chests). So he couldn’t help but need to start buying boxes after boxes of chest pastes.>"
