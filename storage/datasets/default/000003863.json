	"description": "Qin Fen had once been abandoned and broken until, one day, he picked up a liquid metal ball that turned his life upside down.\r\nThis is the interplanetary era where Classical and Modern Wushu are competing. Classical Wushu enables followers to grow as powerful as dragons and elephants, whereas Modern Wushu enables followers to freeze monsters or even extinguish erupting volcanoes.\r\nQin Fen steps onto the stage of both Classical and Modern Wushu while belonging to neither. With the exquisite combination of both Classical Wushu and modern technology, he will pave a way to become a legend.\r\nHe is one of a kind, a favored son of heaven.>"
