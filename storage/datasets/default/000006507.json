	"description": "Thearesia Brenstrom, the villainess whose engagement was always annulled in any route of a certain otome game.\n\nWhen Thearesia had her engagement annulled by Crown Prince Ottmar in public, instead of tears, she had a wide grin on her face.\n\nThearesia Brenstrom had been reincarnated. In her previous life, her bias was Hugo, the ‘Demon Count’, who claimed and trampled on Thearesia after her engagement was dissolved.\n\nThearesia, who had long waited for her annulment, voluntarily leaped into Hugo’s chest.\n\n“…Even if you regret it, I won’t let you go, alright?”\n\n“I love you, so I won’t run away, Lord Hugo—!”\n\nThis is the story of how their love developed.>"
