	"description": "Lu Yu'an was harmed by the scum male and b*tch woman, dying in the end.\n\nFortunately, God gave her a chance to be born again. She polished her eyes in this life, tearing the scum male and bitch woman apart, and holding her husband's thigh!\n\nAll the rumors outside said that Jian Yihan wasn't close to the female gender. Lu Yu'an touched her stomach, and snorted coldly: 'Then where did the ball in my belly come from?\n\nOne day, the man said to her gently: 'An An, the world is big, but all I want is you. Don't leave me, never….. go far away from me!\n\nLu Yu'an touched her head: 'Yes, you're my husband. Of course I can't live without you oh.'>"
