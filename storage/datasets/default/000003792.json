	"description": "My name is Lin Luoqing. Today, I transmigrated into a book but I’m not panicked at all. It is because I know the direction of this book very well. I can definitely use the plot advantage to reach the peak of my life and become a winner in life!\n\nHey, what is with that child over there who is peeking at me? How did he show up at my house? He is looking at me with three parts sadness, five parts dissatisfaction and two parts complicated.>"
