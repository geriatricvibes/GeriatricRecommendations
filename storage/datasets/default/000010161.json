	"description": "As a mad researcher in a tattered white coat activated the self-destruction device, Qin Luo knew that this time, there was no escape.\n\nHe was well aware of the destructive power of the self-destruction device.\n\nEven if he is genetically inborn with an independent space, it is impossible to use the power of his space to resolve against such a terrible explosion.\n\nHis only end would be a torn space and the crushed bones.\n\nOn an unrecognizable earth rampant with zombies and mutant creatures, this end is good.\n\nDeath is far better than living…\n\nWith a skull splitting headache he opened his eyes to find himself reborn in the year before the apocalypse happened.\n\nIs this a joke!!!\n\nIs this a chance for him to be prepared to combat the apocalypse?\n\nIs God not satisfied with all the bitterness he had went through and would enjoy watching him suffer once more?>"
