And what secrets did they keep? Why did their spirits appear thousands of years after their deaths? Their re-emergence will stir up another round of bloodshed in another world....\n\nThe story begins in London on the New Year's Eve of 1999, and a talented but untrained child from the East will embark on a journey of redemption and revenge after tragedy robbed him of his parents and entire clan. It is a world filled with legendary characters from Western and Eastern myths and follow the trials and tribulations of the child as he struggles with the weight of his past and expectations for his future. \n\nBe transported from the scenic River Thames, where the story begins, to the mystical Kunlun Mountain, where our hero trains and grows into the man he needs to become, in order to avenge the deaths of his loved ones.\n\nBe enthralled by the emergence of legendary heroes that you have read from past works of literature and history books. Be terrified by the appearance of demonic figures from the very pits of hell and the darkest parts of our imagination.... They are all very real in the world of the Blood Moon Hunters...>"
