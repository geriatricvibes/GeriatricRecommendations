	"description": "The Second Prince who was my fiancé got another girl pregnant. Along with much fuss, I’ll marry my childhood friend the Third Prince!\r\n\r\nBut he seems to be under a curse.\r\n\r\nMud Monster, I’ve heard of it as so, but n～ He’s more human than I expected?\r\n\r\nNot capitalizing on the serious setting at all, it’s just a story about a high tension heroine and a slightly S hero flirting while lifting the curse.>"
