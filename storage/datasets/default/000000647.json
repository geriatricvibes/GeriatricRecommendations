	"description": "A short story from the official website of a mobile game called Soccer Spirits. This was actually done quite some time ago and it was already posted on some of the game's communities, but I'll be leaving this here too for archiving purposes.\r\n\r\nCaution: Everything in this story might sound very strange if you don't know anything about the game. Especially the whole soccer thing.>"
