	"description": "'I've become the holy maiden's proxy.'\r\n\r\n'Huh? What sort of death flag is that?'\r\n\r\nRuthiana is a duke's daughter. While the holy maiden has yet to be summoned from another world, she is appointed as the holy maiden's proxy and is set to go on a quest to suppress the demons. However, her travel companions are men who, on top of each having their own quirks, lack even a sliver of intention to protect her. How can she subjugate demons with people like this? Before the holy maiden can even be summoned, she might die due to their carelessness. With only one faithful servant by her side, Ruthiana will strike down her death flags!>"
