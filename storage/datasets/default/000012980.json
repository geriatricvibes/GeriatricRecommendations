	"description": "I witnessed a murder scene of a villain.\n\nTo make matters worse, he caught me.\n\nI think I hear the sound of death beckoning.\n\nHe approaches me, his hand in his coat.\n\nI wonder what he’s reaching for.\n\nA knife? A gun? I guess it doesn’t matter. There’s only one thing I can think of now.\n\n“I’m going to die.”\n\nI wasn’t expecting what he pulled out of his coat.\n\n“Will you marry me?”\n\n“What?”>"
