	"description": "A fantasy war chronicle following a bloodstained girl as she races through the battlefields.\n\nThe girl who was born in a poor village, Shera, saw a “tasty-looking​” Death God behind the Liberation Force soldier who was attacking her. Shera ate the Death God before it could bring down its scythe on her. \n\nShe went on to become a soldier of her Kingdom’s Royal Army. With a giant scythe in her hands, she fought to destroy her enemy, the Imperial Army -- And more importantly, to obtain delicious food.>"
