	"description": "I closed my eyes and slept until the next morning. Climbing up from my bed in a daze, I saw that my roommate’s bed is still neat and tidy, like no one has slept on it before. I first checked that no one is in the bedroom, then carefully locked the door before I pounced on his bed and took a big breath.\n\n… Really the same smell from last time! A very light scent, pheromones will not lie! My roommate is an Omega, that’s right! Just that he is a little bit bigger and taller. I vaguely estimated his height by comparing the gap between his head and the door last night.\n\nMe : “……………………………”\n\n…What did this Omega eat to grow so tall?! He’s, like, half a head taller than me!! Not talking about those Alphas who have crazy growth spurts, my height itself is already very tall amongst the Betas! This Omega is even ten centimeters taller than me…\n\nMy self-esteem has suffered a hard blow…>"
