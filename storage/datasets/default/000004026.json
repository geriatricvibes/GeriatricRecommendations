	"description": "Was Cinderella’s Stepsister really a villain?\n\nA love story with the charm of a villain in a fairy tale.\n\nWhen I woke up, I found myself in an unfamiliar space.\nDid I drink so much that I lost consciousness? Then maybe a one-night stand?\nBut what unfolds before my eyes is an unbelievable reality.\n\nThis only happens in the romance fantasy novels I read while running through all my cash…\n\nOh, my God!\nI went to sleep and woke up as Cinderella’s stepsister, a name that no one remembers!\n\nA knight of the Royal Guard, Drake Wolfrick Persson appears before her.\n“I clearly told you to not to go anywhere and wait.”\n\nThe moment the dark voice entered my ears, I became the protagonist of another story.>"
