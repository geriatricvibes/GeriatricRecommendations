	"description": "Li Jia was the adopted daughter of the Lu family, the sister of Lu Yichen. Li Jia loved Lu Yichen all her life and chased him for half his life. He drunkenly shouted another woman's name and asked for her.\r\n\r\nWhen she became pregnant, he brought back another woman he loved so much for her to call sister-in-law. Lu Yichen gave her a lot, but only skimped on love.\r\n\r\nWhen he barged into the busy lane for the woman he loved who was having a temper tantrum, despite the danger, Li Jia rushed in for him too.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Lu, I'm sorry for your loss, your sister and the fetus in her womb have no vital signs.'\r\n\r\nLu Yichen's face, which had been gentle all his life, was grim and gloomy for the first time. When he returned five years ago, his Jiajia was still alive. Only, why did Jiajia not cling to him anymore?>"
