	"description": "Lin Qiu never would’ve thought that she’d be faced with such a heart-racing scene the moment she transmigrated.\n\nWasn’t he the cool male lead that holds himself to a high moral standard? So why was he looking at her with that predatory expression?\n\nLin Qiu: “Hey! Wake up, male lead! I’m the villainess cast to be your wife, not your female lead!”\n\nThe male lead: “You are.”\n\nLin Qiu: “…??!!\n\nAfter.\n\nLin Qiu: “Wake up, male lead! Sabotaging the female lead is my role as the evil female supporting role, not yours!”\n\nLin Qiu: “Wake up, male lead! You killed everyone, how can I create any conflict now?!”\n\nLin Qiu: “You’re the leader of the righteous clan, not the VILLAIN BOSS! Not the  VILLAIN BOSS! Not the VILLAIN BOSS!”>"
