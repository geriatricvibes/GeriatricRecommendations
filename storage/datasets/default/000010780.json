	"description": "Seiya Kanie is a good looking, perfectionist boy who is forced by the mysterious Isuzu Sento to visit an amusement park named Amagi Brilliant Park, which is in serious financial trouble and about to be closed forever.\r\n\r\nThe park is actually staffed by refugees from a magical realm called Maple Land, and the park is a facility for harvesting magical energy from visitors while they’re having fun. As such, the park is the only way the refugees can maintain their existence in the human realm.\r\n\r\nTo save the park from closing, Seiya is hired by the owner, Latifa Fleuranza, to use his skills in entertainment to become its new manager. However, to not lose the land to a real estate agency, they have only three months left to attract 250,000 visitors, a feat that seems impossible given the park’s current situation.>"
