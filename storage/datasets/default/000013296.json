	"description": "Halstead, the land where demons roam. As a demon hunter, a high-ranking lord has one secret.\n\n“I hear the face behind the mask is so ugly?”\n\n“Even demons will be afraid!”\n\nIt’s the monstrous appearance of Lord Erden, hidden right below the mask! Everyone sympathizes with the lord’s wife Leticia, who married such a lord, but she also has a secret to hide-\n\n“I’m always grateful. This monster’s face must be disgusting and horrible, but he never shows it and does it so well. ”\n\n“Eh, what? Of course.”\n\n“Since your arrival, our land has developed remarkably. The demons are tied to their wives. That’s amazing. No matter how much you think about it, you’re too good for me. That’s why I have to divorce you myself!”\n\nLeticia, who was listening with a hazy face, was shocked. Divorce?\n\nBut unlike her determined husband, Leticia had no intention of getting divorced! He wouldn’t either.\n\nThe husband, known as a terrible monster, was actually a great beauty.\n\nAre you divorced now? The devil will cry and the trick + obsession will come.>"
