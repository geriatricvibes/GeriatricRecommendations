	"description": "The world did not expect that the king of Shi Mountain and leader of good-for-nothings, Xia HouLian, would be reduced to the lowest rank in Dongchang. He had a monthly salary of two taels, which wasn’t even enough for rent.\n\nAs a rebel in the martial arts world and Dongchang’s most wanted criminal, Xia HouLian did not expect that the delicate young master he had met in his childhood would actually become the powerful and arrogant governor of Dongcheng.\n\nAs for that governor, there was a beam of white moonlight in his heart, a memory of someone that he had coveted for a long time yet was out of reach.\n\n'I’ll become a ghost for you, and you’ll become a Buddha for me.'>"
