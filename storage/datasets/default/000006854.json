	"description": "Xiao Meng muttered: “Got abused like a dog when chasing the male god ah!“\r\n\r\nLuo Yun’s ears were extremely sharp. When he heard her, he frowned as he closed the folder he was holding. His voice was cold as he said: “Even dogs are not as abused as you are.”\r\n\r\n———–\r\n\r\nXiao Meng received the task to protect the male god, and thus she became his personal bodyguard.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, she suddenly heard that the male god was about to get engaged, so she thought of using the trick of injuring herself to get the enemy’s confidence, and purposely bumped into his car as an “accident”.\r\n\r\nXiao Meng later woke up in the hospital, looking as if she was turned into a fool by the accident.
