	"description": "None of us could forget her.\r\n\r\nThe six of us spent our college days in Kyoto. Ten years ago at the Kurama Fire Festival, Hasegawa vanished into thin air. Ten years later, the remaining five found ourselves back in Kurama once again, hoping to meet her one more time. As night fell, we began to swap stories about strange things we'd encountered on our journeys, including the mysterious series of artworks by Kishida Michio called 'Night Train'. Morimi Tomihiko masterfully weaves strands of youth and fantasy into spine-tingling ghost stories of sojourns into night.\r\n\r\n'There's no place that night doesn't touch. All the world's in perpetual night.'>"
