He has known his childhood friend Kaori Nishijo for more than ten years.\r\n\r\nMy childhood friend has always wanted to hide my face. My hair was basically left long, and because we were together 24/7, I didn't have many friends.\r\n\r\nIn this world where polygamy is allowed, the battle continues between those around Haruto who gradually begin to notice his charms and his childhood friend who tries to keep it hidden.>"
