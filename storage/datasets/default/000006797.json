	"description": "'You can live with me, or you can die with me. Whichever you prefer, okay?'\r\n\r\nUniversity student 'Sousuke Takenaga' is targeted by 'Honjo Tsubaki', a yandere woman who confines, eavesdrops, stalks...and everything else.\r\n\r\nTakenaga continues to reject love that is too heavy for him at all costs, but Tsubaki's mad love accelerates day by day.\r\n\r\nAs their barren battle continues, Takenaga's peaceful life is disrupted by the appearance one after another of unique heroines, including a beautiful but rather clumsy psychic, an eccentric legal loli who wants to be the protagonist's younger sister, a dreamy girl with a rough temperament, and a bewitching high school girl who follows a snake.\r\n\r\nIt is a romantic comedy in which the protagonist sometimes dies.>"
