	"description": "I, Fiara, was born to a commoner father and a mother of noble status.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, I was treated as a maid while my mother only dotes on my younger sister. No matter how hard I worked, I was not allowed to advance in my studies as well.\r\n\r\n“If so, I should just leave such a family...!!”\r\n\r\nAfter running away from home, on my way to the royal capital, I met a magic user, Zak, who changed my entire life.>"
