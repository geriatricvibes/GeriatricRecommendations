	"description": "The Duke's daughter, Leila, has been destined to marry the fifth prince, Oswald, ever since she was a child.\r\nThe only person who can truly support him is herself, his fiancé.\r\n\r\nThat's why Leila didn't indulge Oswald any more than necessary, and sometimes gave him a hard time.\r\nBecause that was her way of loving him.\r\n\r\n―However, Leila's thoughts did not reach Oswald.\r\n\r\n'I'm breaking off my engagement with you, you nagging little b!tch! Instead, I'm taking your sister as my wife!'\r\n'Eh...'\r\n>"
