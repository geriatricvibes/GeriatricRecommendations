	"description": "--Can you confront the darkness!?\r\n\r\nI find myself in a world very similar to the social game [Abyss Calling], in which you use randomly summoned [followers] for adventure.\r\n\r\nThe game is balanced by the management's manipulation of probability, the rare greed sensor installed, and the need to pay for the game! The audacity to call itself Abyss! In a world similar to the shitty game which was called the strongest money collecting system and was terminated by the law after hitting millions of users to the bottom, I stand up again as a caller to accomplish what I left unfinished when I was a player.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of brave summoners who challenge the darkness.>"
