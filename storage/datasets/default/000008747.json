	"description": "Unrequited love is like a pot of strong wine. You know perfectly well that it will make you dizzy, let you lose yourself, and that it will be painful. Yet like moths to a flame, it is gladly endured.\n\nYou take care not to overdo it, but I will not stop until I get thoroughly drunk.\n\nHowever, for any amount of drunkenness, one day I'll have to sober up.>"
