	"description": "I was born in a poor small valley as a bastard, my family is dirt poor, and I am unable to get a girlfriend.\n\nOne day, my father gave me beautiful wife, but during the wedding night she found my cowardice. She not only did not let me touch her, but also kept calling me out openly, and flirted with other men in front of my face.... \n\nMy cowardly self could not take it anymore and I finally snapped. I gave the adulterer a serious injury and was imprisoned. \n\nI gradually understood in the prison, if you do not want to be bullied, you can't be a coward, you need a big fist!>"
