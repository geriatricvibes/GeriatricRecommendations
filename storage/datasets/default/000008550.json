	"description": "Asaba Rika, a beautiful international student from Japan, stayed at my home under the arrangement of her father, and I was honorably appointed as Rika’s Chinese life mentor.\n\nDuring our time together, I discovered a lot of her secrets ……\n\nShe gets lost every time she goes out. She curls up in a ball like a little cat when she sleeps. She likes to hold the cup with both hands when she drinks water. She is crazy about claw crane games, and she made up her mind to earn money to buy her own house…\n\nI would never ever fall in love with such a silly girl like her!!!\n\nAfter several years, Rika held my hand and asked:\n\n“She Yu, why do you like scientific research?”\n\n“Because you can discover all the answers through science and experiments.”\n\n“What about love?”\n\n“That’s an exception.”>"
