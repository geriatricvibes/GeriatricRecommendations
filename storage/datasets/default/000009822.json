	"description": "'You look cute, like me.'\r\n\r\nThis handsome man, who speaks with a soft voice now, is a tyrant of the times (probably?)\r\n\r\n. . . and who also happens to be my damn father.\r\n\r\nIn my previous life, this man suddenly killed me for no reason.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign, and all I know is that the woman whispered to her father.\r\n\r\nNow I have to make this man my prisoner again.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be as easy as last life.\r\n\r\nYou need to be more perfect before the woman shows up.\r\n\r\nFirst, drink some milk. Zap.\r\n\r\nAs I looked at Abby, I laughed lightly.\r\n\r\nThen she flapped her short arms.\r\n\r\n'Dad?'\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to survive.\r\n>"
