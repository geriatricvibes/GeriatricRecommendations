	"description": "By coincidence, Li Yunmu found a super machine from humanity’s age of darkness. From that point onwards, his ordinary life would never be the same! Aptitude? Innate talent? What are these? Could they be eaten?\n\nI have neither aptitude nor innate skill, but my shadow can level up using hacks. Experience, Ability points, battle prowess… all of them could be hacked. Even while he is asleep or tired, he could still increase his skills.\n\n[Ding, your shadow has killed an ant, you have gained experience points and ability points.]\n[Ding, your shadow has successfully killed a dragonfly, it dropped a dimensionality box.]\nCrap, even killing insects can also increase his experience and get him rewards. What else!>"
