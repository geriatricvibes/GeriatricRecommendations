	"description": "In a village that is like the “First Village”, lived the innkeeper’s son, Ruth. In his previous life he had no affinity to women because he was a burly man but since he has become a handsome youth in this life, he is going to do his best (However, he still isn’t popular at all). At that time, he discovered that his childhood best friend, Alec, was a hero. And then, for some strange reason, Alec begged Ruth “Until I come home, please wait for me” …\n\nThere is a tale in the First Village where the famous people who were involved with the hero, Alec, came along one-by-one to cause trouble and approach Ruth, who was leisurely living out his life in the countryside.\n\nA spoiled and infatuated Hero x A dense and broad-minded Innkeeper’s son>"
