	"description": "With a heart full of determination to sacrifice myself, I decided to assassinate the Crown Prince from the neighboring country. However, when I woke up the next day, I discovered that I had transformed into him, and him into me.\n\nBesides the feud between our countries, we had to confront numerous other problems – for instance, how we intended to bathe, how we intended to use the toilet, and most importantly, every morning, when I woke up, I always feel slightly embarrassed.\n\nHe wasn’t awkward in the slightest, just that he frequently forgot that I am a woman.>"
