	"description": "Even though the me who transmigrated into a villainess knows the end of being covered in semen while being visibly pregnant, I still came to like my fiance Oscar-sama, a capture  target.\r\n\r\nI decided to support the heroine, my younger sister Astel, with her relation with Oscar-sama but as expected, the pain of my heart hurts enough to cry. Before getting my engagement annulled with the cliche of being accused for bullying, I thought I'd cancel it myself.\r\n\r\nThat was the plan but... oh my? My fiance's state seems a bit...\r\n\r\n(Last bit is basically the title; Oya? Konyakusha no Yousu ga...)>"
