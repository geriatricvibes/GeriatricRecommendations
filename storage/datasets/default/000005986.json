	"description": "Akira Misato, who’s withdrawn and has no friends, moves to a new house before graduating from junior high school and woke up in his new house as a girl the next day.\n\nOnly his father and mother remember that Akira was a boy. Everything else from his certificate of residence to his family register, shows him to be a girl.\n\nHis father, who loved him even as a boy, was very excited, while his mother calmly began to educate him about how to be a girl. Overwhelmed and confused, he decides, “I’ll just maintain a low profile.”\n\nThis is an easy-going story about school and love.>"
