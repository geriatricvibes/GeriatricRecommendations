	"description": "She possessed a villainess who is known and hated for her evil acts in an unpopular novel. But because of her personality, it was extremely difficult for her to play the villainess role. But not for long…\n\n“I’ll fix your dress according to your taste this instant!”\n\n“My request.”\n\n“O-Of course! As per your request, there’s only one piece available in the whole Empire.”\n\nPeople around me listen to me well even if I just frown and sit still. Since I don’t have to live in difficulty, I decided to just comfortably live on as a villainess.\n\n“Father. Is it necessary for you to solve formulas in this slow and inefficient way?”\n\nI thought it would be good to be a rich villainess, so I used all my knowledge.\n\n“Why don’t you give me the honor of escorting the Princess?”\n\nI have had enough of dealing with my father, so why did an unexpected character suddenly appear? What if this person disrupts my plan?>"
