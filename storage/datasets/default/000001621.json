	"description": "“Sister, let’s change jobs!”\n\nI was reincarnated in a R-19 novel!\n\nThe kind-hearted older sister was the female protagonist, and the three young masters we serve were bastards who imprisoned and bullied her.\n\n“Lala. I don’t think that would happen. They give us a lot of money, and the welfare is good… When will we ever find another job like this?”\n\nShit! My sister doesn’t know anything.\n\nIn order to escape from the original work, I desperately interfered between my sister and the masters…\n\nHuh?\n\nFrom a certain moment, the eyes of the three young masters looking at me are unusual!\n\n***\n\nIf you know everything, you get more and more exhausted every time you try to change it!>"
