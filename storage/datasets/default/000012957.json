She ended up time traveling to the future and entered the gaming circle during the VR era.  \n\nRighteous Cloud: “I’ll take you to fly.”\nBlue Skies said with disdain: “I don’t need it.”\n\nWhite light flashed, see you at the resurrection point. \n\nRighteous Cloud: “Taking you to fly.”\nBlue Skies was angry: “Go to hell! Get out! I said I don’t need it!”\n\nThere was another flash of white light.
