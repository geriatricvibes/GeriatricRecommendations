	"description": "Arion, a rural town in the kingdom of Squire. There lies the coffee shop “Trancalm”, where 22-year-old, Lia Schmidt works. On a quiet day just like any other day, her childhood friend and ex-leader of children, Adam, came home after being recognized for his achievements as a knight. Meanwhile, the mysterious and terribly odd, Leon Walter came to Trancalm. It appears that he likes sweets… Hm? What’s making that rapid swishing sound… it’s bushy and brown, no way, a tail!? Eh, is it real? Electric powered? Where the heck is that tail coming from–!?>"
