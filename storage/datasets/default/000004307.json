	"description": "My brother* and I, from elementary school to university, had grown up together. We didn’t just get into the same degree, we’re also sharing the same dormitory room. \n\nOthers may think that our brotherly bond is close but in fact, without my knowledge, he actually had ulterior motives. \n\nFinally, one day, his wolfish intentions were revealed. \n\nI had thought that with my rejection, he would give up but…. This actually became the reason for him to openly tease me? \n\nAh, everywhere were traps. \n\nQuestion: What to do if the person chasing me is too black-bellied?\n\nAnswer: The best solution —— Accept him. >"
