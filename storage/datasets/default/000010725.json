	"description": "The burden of regret after her unforgivable betrayal to a man came crushing down on her. Mora decided to ask for forgiveness and made a trip to visit him in his prison. Alas, she made too easy of a choice. The moment she realized it, it was over. She couldn’t go back. \n\nThe man was not how he used to be.\n\n“It pains me to touch you. But you are so lovely, it makes me crazy. I hate it when you don’t look at me.”\n\nShe fell in love with him, the beautiful and dangerous man who had saved her and whom she ruined.\n\nThey kept on loving and detesting each other.\n\n***\n\nBam!\n\nHer head turned at the sound of the horn and she froze on the spot. It was the sound of a five-ton truck roaring towards her. In a blink of an eye, death had claimed her. \n\nBut to her surprise, she saw a man appear before her. He was as beautiful as an angel and looked lethal as a devil.\n\n“I’ve been looking for you,” said the man. “Mora, my lovely wife.”\n\nWhy did he save her? And why was he looking at her like that?>"
