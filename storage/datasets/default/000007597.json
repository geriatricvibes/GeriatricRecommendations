	"description": "A maid who is beaten on behalf of a noble boy.\n\nSome memories of her childhood were cruel, but Yuriel held no resentment towards the boy. Rather, she liked it–The hand that carefully applied medicine to her wounds was always warm.\n\n“M-Master, stop, Raph, sa, save…ah, mm…!”\n\n“That’s why.. I told you.. to wait.. till I returned.”\n\nBut the Raphlet that appeared in her dreams showed nothing but passion and lust.\n\nProphetic dreams.\n\nThe ability that was like a stigma drove Yuriel towards an unknown future.\n\nAll I want is to be next to you.>"
