	"description": "She passed through the fiction world from an adult novel she read in secret away from public eyes and possessed the heroine, the unlucky female lead who’d gone mad after being thoroughly violated by the male lead.\n\nAriel, the new heroine, loathed this idea, so she decided to change it.\n\n“Your body belongs to me,” she thought to herself as she looked at the male lead.\n\nIf she was to be criticized as the cruel and beautiful saint, she would live up to this expectation well.>"
