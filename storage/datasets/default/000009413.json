	"description": "A light-hearted story about how a super clingy MC, Yan Zhuo, pursues his one true love, Shen Ji, who once saved him. They will soon learn more about each other, that Yan is not just a mere dandy who has nothing better to do than chasing Shen, and that Shen is not the perfect elite as Yan fancies him to be.>"
