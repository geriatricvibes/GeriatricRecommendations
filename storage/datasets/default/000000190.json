	"description": "Reiji Saeki, who lives in the north eastern countryside town, lost his life in an accident during summer vacation. ……But before he knew it, a mysterious ball of light hovered in front of his eyes in a world of whiteness. That ball of light was a magician from a parallel world, and is looking for a person qualified to inherit the magic they had created to prevent it from being lost. Reiji, who rode on that suggestion, now lives in the parallel world Elgin, with a new body and powerful magical power.>"
