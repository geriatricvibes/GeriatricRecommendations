	"description": "This is the “Country of Cats”. Touya, who had died in the human world, became an “ayakashi cat” and came to this world. At least that’s what the man who helped him, Kiri, had said, but Touya was unable to remember if he was a human or cat originally. However, when he was told by Natsuki and Akio, the friendly children with cat ears and tails, that he was to be married to Kiri, his heart started to race!?>"
