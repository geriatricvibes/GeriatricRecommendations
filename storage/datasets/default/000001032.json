	"description": "During a party one evening in the royal palace, Rachel, the eldest daughter of Duke Ferguson, was reproached by Prince Elliot for sins she didn’t remember committing and their engagement was abandoned. Rachel informed everyone she had not committed the acts they were accusing her of, but she was dragged away out of the party venue and thrown into the palace dungeon.\n\nAnd so Rachel thought,\n\n“Hooray for my slow doing-whatever-I-want life! No more queen’s education, no more noisy servants–today marks the start of my long vacation!”\n\nBetween enjoying all of the preparations she had made for this very occasion and constantly harassing the annoying Prince, Rachel is going to enjoy her slow prison life to the fullest!>"
