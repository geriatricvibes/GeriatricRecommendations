	"description": "'I want you to accept me as I am.'\r\n\r\nIt was the renowned prince who requested such a thing to Sophie Calendula, a duke's daughter.\r\n\r\nBut as a result of a poor diet and lack of care, he had a bulging gut and acne-ridden skin. She was somewhat reluctant to have such a person as her partner, despite his status as a prince. With that in mind, she did the most logical thing and rejected him. \r\n\r\nHowever, one year later, somewhat unexpected happens to Sophie--!?>"
