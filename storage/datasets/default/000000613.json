	"description": "I possessed the body of “Fiona,” the final villain whose soul was sentenced to eternal suffering after her gruesome demise at the hands of the world’s savior.\n\nJust because she was an illegitimate child, she was tortured by her own family.\n\nAnd so… arriving six years before the start of the novel, I was sent to war at the age of thirteen! Fortunately, as the story’s greatest villain, Fiona was a magical genius.\n\nI had to survive the monster invasion. But now, I couldn’t be in the middle of a battlefield.\n\nJust before I ran out of breath, I encountered the adolescent male lead.\n\n…… Why was he here?\n\nAnyway, if the male lead dies here, then the world will be destroyed. So, let’s save him first!                                                                                                                                        >"
