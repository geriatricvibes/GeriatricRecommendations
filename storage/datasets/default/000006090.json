	"description": "Henry, born in a royal family without skills, is given territory on the border. It’s a grassland full of monsters,, with no people, no resources, and no hope.\n\nDisheartened, Henry wanders the grasslands and falls underground through a hole. However, the moment he touches a stone monument there, words echo in his mind.\n\nIt is a mysterious dungeon filled with ancient items, traps, and malevolence. If you die inside, you lose your status and have to start over, but that doesn’t matter to Henry’s off-the-charts skill, “Maintain Status”. No matter how many times he dies, he can always grow and start over.\n\nHenry will die again today. All for the sake of developing his territory with dungeon clear rewards.>"
