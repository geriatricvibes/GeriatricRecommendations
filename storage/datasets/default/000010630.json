A Fairy tales is also a novels!\r\n\r\nI entered into the fairy tale 'Cinderella'. But fortunately or unfortunately, there are so many unknown stories.\r\n\r\nThe stepmother and the sisters are kind, and the prince is the crown prince and there are so many scandals.\r\n\r\nWell, that was fine. Because he was a villain, so it was better than the terrifying ending.\r\n\r\n'I can't stand it!'\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the female lead is a young girl who is trying to marry the prince, The fact that I, who possessed the female lead older sister, is sick and tired to hear her complaining!\r\n\r\nI'll figure it out somehow and enjoy a happy life! ......that's what I thought.\r\n\r\n'.....Is that a lip marks on your collar?'\r\n\r\n'Hwizna Youngae! Are you strangling me?'\r\n\r\n'The marriage proposal has arrived. Sasha.'\r\n\r\nI just wanted to stop my younger sister, but why does things keep getting so messed up!>"
