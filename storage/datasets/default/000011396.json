	"description": "Having just finished his midterms on a snowy day, Yamanaka Tooru encountered Miyamoto Satsuki—a girl said to be the cutest in town—at the front gates of his school.\n\nSatsuki was standing there alone without so much a scarf or even a coat.\n\nTooru wanted to simply slip by, but gave in and wrapped his scarf around her.\n\nDays camly past by after that incident.\n\nThat was until Satsuki entered Tooru's high school and then his home uninvited.\n\n“I have to return the favor you showed me.”\n\n“I didn’t really do much though…”\n\nThis is the tale between the awkwardly blunt Tooru and the misfortunate and meddlesome Satsuki.>"
