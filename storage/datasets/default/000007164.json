After rebirth, she wanted to live unrestrainedly, but accidentally married Ling Chen, the Fourth Prince who was calculating, manipulative, and had bad reputation.\r\n\r\nConspiracy, hypocrisy, greed, framing, blackmail, she took them all one by one. Getting a big payoff for a small effort, love is like a sharp knife!\r\n\r\nLan Ling: Why did Wangye climb over the wall and come to my room?\r\nLing Chen: Why do you think I’m here?\r\nLan Ling: Does Wangye likes climbing to someone else's bed in the middle of the night?\r\nLing Chen: Presumptuous! How is this someone else's bed?>"
