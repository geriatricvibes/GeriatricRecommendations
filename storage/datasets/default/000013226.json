	"description": "When I opened my eyes, I was in another world.\r\n\r\nWhy? Why? Just as I was thinking about it, my parents abandoned me.\r\n\r\nWhen I was attacked by dogs and was in a helpless situation, I awoke to magic.\r\n\r\nFor a while, I sought safety and information. I spent my days at a pioneer village and used magic and looked for information.\r\n\r\nWhile I spent those days in peace, a new power awakened in me.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for that power, I had to leave the village and go to a new town.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about a little timid boy who uses his wits, violence, and sometimes a bit of luck to survive.\r\n\r\nUnwittingly he was called a “miracle”.\r\n>"
