	"description": "The person who sneaked into my bed that night was my girlfriend’s little sister.\r\n\r\n'If we meet again, then let's be... lovers.'\r\n\r\nIt was the promise I made to my childhood friend, Mahiru Mitsuha, on a distant day.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of my second year of high school, we had a fateful reunion. We conveyed our unchanging feelings to each other, and we became a couple.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a happy life together with Mahiru, who left her parents and came to live in my house.\r\n\r\nHowever, someone else was with her— It was Saya, Mahiru's younger sister.\r\n\r\nOne night, Saya sneaked into my bedroom and gave me a kiss.\r\n\r\n'Shh, don't make a sound. And keep this a secret from Onee-chan, okay?'\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, the life with the three of us and our secrets began.\r\n\r\nUntil the day I crossed the line with my girlfriend's little sister.\r\n>"
