	"description": "Hijiri was reincarnated in an ancient family that is actually a modern-day Onmyoji family. \n\n “I want to become a celebrity so that someone will remember me.”\n\nWith this wish in mind, he is reincarnated and steadily grows stronger through a method of spiritual empowerment that only children can undertake.\n\nIn his spare time, he trains his spiritual power, learns the art of Onmyoji at an early age, and rises to professional status before anyone else.\n\nThis is a reincarnation story of a man who enjoys his second life, even though some of his wishes are a bit mundane.>"
