A girl who doesn’t know the her place is not entertaining.”\r\n\r\nThere were scenes of endless harassment by the tr*shy men.\r\n\r\nThe moment that thought passed through my head like a flash, I decided.\r\n\r\nLet’s avoid the male lead, and kick out the villain!\r\n\r\nBye, everyone! I threw away my destiny and left in search of happiness.>"
