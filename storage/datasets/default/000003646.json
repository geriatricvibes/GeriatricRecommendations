	"description": "I am a little bit strange. I ate aconite, a deadly poison, out of curiosity. Then, I was reincarnated into another world and ended up living with poison. In this turbulent world, I eat poison.\r\n\r\n “I’m going to try all kinds of poison that I could’ve only tasted once before!”\r\n\r\nI ignored the cold stare of the person I’m living with as I smiled again today in satisfaction.>"
