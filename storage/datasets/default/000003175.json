He turned into a rabbit. A white, soft, plump rabbit, (who) spoke with the low timbre of an adult male, “Save me.” His little head turned, I suspect that he is cursed by someone, and needs a true love kiss to turn him back. But, I’m unexpectedly his true love? When breaking up, he even called me a pig. I smirked, laughing gleefully, “Ha ha, saving this person, no I’ll never save him!\n\nTr*sh, you also have that day when you fall into my hands!!>"
