	"description": "They love gold, and they love silver. Even more so, they love gems that dazzle, like stars across the skies.\r\nFirearms, jewelleries, and precious metals; A collector’s world will not be complete without antiques.\r\nStorage auctions, old goods trade, re-estate sales and gold-digging. But the truth is, if one wants to make money, then the supreme way is through searching for the legendary treasures.\r\nHolding the fort, there’s an ocelot, a wolf, and an Andes condor. At the side, there’s a loyal hound, an irascible ape, and an African honey badger. Who said that you can only rely on humans when treasure hunting?!>"
