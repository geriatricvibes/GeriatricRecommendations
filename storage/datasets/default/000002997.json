	"description": "This novel is a sweet and fluffy romcom telling the days of a boyfriend and girlfriend right after they’ve started dating. \r\nThe boyfriend, Watase Kairi, 17 years old, is a first-year in high school (returnee). Having just woken up from a 2-year coma, he’s a bit of a problematic young man.\r\nThe girlfriend, Koori Nano, 16 years old, is also a first-year in high school. A slightly annoying beauty, who loves dressing up and anything that sounds interesting.\r\nThe daily lives of the two basically boil down to this.\r\n\r\n“Senpaaai, am I not super duper cute today~? Come on, it wouldn’t hurt to praise me a---”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, you really are cute.”\r\n\r\n“~~~!”\r\n\r\n“Koori?”\r\n\r\n“---This is exactly what I’m talking about, Senpai!”\r\n\r\nA story of a slightly unaware Senpai, and the always immediately flustered Kouhai. No dangers of a heroine race or a breakup, just a pure and wholesome romcom.>"
