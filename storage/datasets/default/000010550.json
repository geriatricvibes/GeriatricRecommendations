	"description": "One cannot ask for love in a generational arranged marriage; one can only hope for harmony between the two families.\r\n\r\nShe was reborn like the withered spring flowers.\r\n\r\nThey are the same events, but it is now an entirely different life. She knows the process, but she cannot guess the outcome.\r\n\r\nShe was reborn, not just for revenge.\r\n\r\nShe was reborn, not just to give herself another chance.\r\n\r\nShe was reborn, so that she could prevent tragedy and allow many others to receive much, much more happiness.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMale Lead: Only hope for one person’s heart, til gray do we part.\r\n\r\nFemale Lead: Ah, these words sound nice. But hubby, you’re going to let me manage all of our land and money, right?>"
