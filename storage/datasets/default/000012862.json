	"description": "「I was just enjoying my time at the pub, and then—..!」\r\n\r\nYoshida Shuta is just your average 32-year old dropout. Well, that is other than his numerous amount of part-time jobs! From convenience stores to construction and even civil engineering! Yoshida Shuta has accomplished much in his modest thirty-two years.\r\n\r\n「Money makes the world go around. I’ll do anything to make it, even if that means taking up every profession in the world!」\r\n\r\nEnjoying his night after leaving the pub, he finds himself suddenly transported to a fantasy world…with no clothes! Thought of as suspicious, he’s immediately taken prisoner and forced to work to sustain the lives of a small village.\r\n\r\n「Seriously, why am I naked?!」\r\n\r\nThe story of a single bachelor who climbs his way up the social ladder, starts a harem, and fights monsters—all without clothes!>"
