	"description": "I, Charlotte, the daughter of a count who was raised strictly by my parents to be able to do everything, became engaged to Leinhardt, the legitimate son of a duke.\r\n\r\nMy sister Milim cries that it is not fair. She claims that I am the reason why she is sick.\r\n\r\nLeanhardt, who had long been infatuated with her sister's reputed fairy-like beauty, abandoned me so easily when he heard the story.\r\n\r\n'Your sister is more beautiful than anyone, but I knew you'd be better.'\r\n\r\nSoon after, Leanhardt came to try to get back together with me.\r\n\r\nNo, it's too late for that since I'm already going to marry the crown prince of a neighboring country.\r\n\r\nI'm grateful to my parents for giving me a strict education in a wide range of ancient and modern knowledge, as well as languages.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, my sister was spoiled like a child and had no education or anything. She grew up to be selfish.\r\n>"
