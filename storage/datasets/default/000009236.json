	"description": "Rett Pot fell in love.\r\n\r\nIt was during the entrance ceremony of Teito Daiichi Military school. For Rett, who was just sixteen years old, the welcoming dance performance, enhanced with military arts and performed by his seniors,  proved exceedingly wondrous and captivating.\r\n\r\nAmongst all the magnificent performances, the martial arts dances performed by the students ranked one and two especially took his breath away, held his gaze captive.\r\n\r\nRett Pot couldn't help but fall in love.\r\n>"
