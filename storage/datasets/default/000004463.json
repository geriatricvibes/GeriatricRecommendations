	"description": "In the year 9102 of the astronomic calendar, it has been seven thousand years since mankind left the earth. \r\n\r\nIn the interstellar era, the earth's civilization was lost, and human beings lived on nutrients. \r\n\r\nAnd this year, a visitor from the 21st century of the earth set off a gourmet storm. \r\n\r\n……. \r\n\r\nTu Rongrong transmigrated to the interstellar era and became a small pitiful person who has lost both her parents and was driven away by the family clan……\r\n\r\nTu Rongrong has no money and there is still a two-year-old cub that needs to be raised. Therefore, she can only rely on the private planet that is the only legacy left by her parents and built up a family fortune. \r\n\r\nBuild a house, grow vegetables, plant grain;\r\n\r\nCook delicious food, open live broadcasts, write novels;\r\n\r\nInadvertently, she revived the earth's historical civilization and revived the earth's culinary food culture…… \r\n\r\nTu Rongrong: Really, at first, I just wanted to make money to raise a child, nothing more. \r\n\r\n……. \r\n\r\nSpicy sticks, hot pot, instant noodles;\r\n\r\nBread, ham, salt-baked chicken…… \r\n\r\nWhat would you like to eat? >"
