	"description": "Charlie Jiang doesn't really care about the marriage with Mandy Song. During the three years of their marriage, he doesn't even try to understand her. He has always only listened to Vivi Qiao's one-sided words and condemns Mandy Song of crimes she never committed. Has it never occurred to him that when there is a crisis in Jiang family, Mandy Song agrees to their marriage without slightest hesitation, for what? Charlie Jiang never cares for Mandy Song, so he never knows that for such a long time he used to be her world, her whole world.\r\n\r\nBut even if he knows, what difference would that make?\r\n\r\nI, Mandy Song, is simply not the one he cherishes in heart.\r\n\r\nFor Charlie, only Vivi matters the whole world to him.\r\n\r\nHow pathetic!>"
