	"description": "This story is about love, brotherhood of army comrades and affection between family members. It truly records the experiences and mental state of the stubborn and rebellious “Little Zhuang”, a soldier of the Chinese special troop.\n\nSome memories deliberately suppressed so as to be forgotten once surging, like a bullet hit the heart, would gush out with tears and blood.\n\nLittle Zhuang, 27 years old, sitting in front of the computer, recalled those dreamlike years: Old Gunner, Recruits Company, Reconnaissance Company, DogHead Brigade and Peacekeeping Force; Ying, Platoon Leader Chen, Company Commander Miao…\n\nIn this story, you can see the unforgettable love, charm, loyalty and honor of Chinese soldiers!>"
