You’ll be owned by me.”\n\n“I shall serve you as if I loved you, my lady.”\n\nAn earl's daughter and a lover of paintings, Riz, is told “Give yourself to me” by John, the temporary art gallery manager employed by her uncle. However, those words weren’t of love or romance, but because he wanted the “Holy Eyes” that could see the demons lurking in paintings which Riz had. Pressed into a contract by John, who was actually a demon, the response Riz gave was— that she was going to own a demon!?\n\nThis is a love fantasy concerning the painting of an unconventional young lady and a caustic demon!>"
