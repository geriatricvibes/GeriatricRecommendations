How can I fool more people into my sect?”\r\nAsked a devil in the devil world.\r\n\r\n“Do you know how to save the family cat that died last night?”\r\nSomeone in the sky is too embarrassed and asks me quietly.\r\n\r\n“All the angel, all the big deity, please I am not God, I am really just a summoner….”\r\nI said painfully.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a poor boy and how he becomes the greatest summoner who dominates the six worlds because of an accidental acquisition of Dimension.>"
