	"description": "Shen Wanying, 17 years old, was the famous young lady from the first private school in City A. Born in a reputable family, she had the best of the best performances and a gentle personality to boot. Wherever she went, she looked elegant and beautiful, a goddess in the hearts of all the students in the school.\r\n\r\nShe was the class flower, the grade flower, and the school flower.\r\n\r\nUntil one day... comes a boy named Huo Cheng who knew all her little secrets. He knew that she loathed studying and secretly drinks alcohol; he knew she loved to shake her feet when eating instant noodles!\r\n\r\nShen Wanying: 'She is in trouble :') '\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHuo Cheng died on November 11th. When he awoke, he went back to the year he was seventeen. All seemed strange and familiar and all he could remember was that his beloved wife, Shen Wanying, killed him!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n'How much do you like me?' Shen Wanying asked Huo Cheng that day.\r\n\r\nHuo Cheng looked at her deeply and finally said, 'I love you. I'm willing to give you all my life.'>"
