	"description": "She time-traveled and became the daughter of the Grand Preceptor who had eloped with a man and was thrown into a graveyard after being poisoned. After detoxifying her body on her own and returning to the Grand Preceptorâ€™s Mansion, she succeeded in a counterattack. With her superb medical skills and knowledge in poison, she struck back when her family was framed. When the Crown Prince breathed down her neck, she dealt with the situation tactically and even feigned an affair to help her brother-in-law seize the throne.>"
