	"description": "Beatty, a weak squirrel shapeshifter who was born into a lion family.\nBecause of that, I lived my life being abused at my aunt’s house in the Capital. \nWhen I told my only friend and fiancé, the Second Prince, that I would leave to achieve my dream,\n\n‘Ritter, you bastard…!’\n\nI died on his fangs.\n\nI opened my eyes again to my childhood, the time before I got myself involved with the Second Prince.\nAt times like this, what do you need? Speed.\nI immediately withdrew my body only and ran away to the territory of my biological father, the Lion Duke.\n\nThough I won’t be welcomed, if I possess this one great secret that will only be discovered in the future, I won’t get kicked ou—\n\n“Welcome, Young Miss!”\n“OMG! When did you grow up like this…?”\n“Young Miss is walking with those two cute feet!”\n\n… Huh? Why am I welcomed like this?\nNo way, is that my statue?\n>"
