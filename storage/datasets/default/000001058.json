Are you still not going to admit it?' \r\n\r\nYe Fei has drawn the worst lot in life. Her father is a coward, her mother exploits her, and her older sister schemes against her. \r\n\r\nAfter having been manipulated into a pregnancy five years ago, never in Ye Fei's wildest dreams did she expect the father of her son to be a diamond bachelorâ€”adored all across the nation.>"
