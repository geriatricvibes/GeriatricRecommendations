	"description": "Gu Lu was a Paleontologist. He was very glad to reborn as a small dinosaur.\n\nBut the terrible thing was that he turned into a Triceratops cub inside a nest of Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nTyrannosaurus Rex was the strongest carnivore known in the history of the Earth, also called the “Imperial Species”.\n\nTriceratops was an herbivorous dinosaur and the staple food of Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nBut fortunately, he had a very doting Tyrannosaurus Rex “Dad” called Mungo, who named him Gulu.\n\nGulu thought that he could only be a salted fish Triceratops holding Tyrannosaurus Rex’s golden thigh in his life.\n\nUnexpectedly, he helped the Triceratopses escape a big glacier, Pterosaurs flying away from the volcanic sea, and the Sea King Gliodon fleeing from the super storm…\n\nHe became the “King of Dinosaurs” when he was not careful and was honored as “King Gulu” by the dinosaurs.\n\nGulu: Dad, this name you gave me is not domineering or cool at all!\n\nMungo: Gulu, lovely.>"
