	"description": "One day, I introduced myself at my new school and when I was about to take my seat, I was suddenly swallowed by a light and lost consciousness.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I found myself in a white and gray space …There’s someone who got down on his knees…?\n\nApparently, the gods got the capacity wrong and I couldn’t get back to my world. Moreover, I can’t just go to the transference site as I am…?\n\nIf I can’t go home. I’ll live free over here!\n\nOn Earth, I was oppressed in a lot of ways because of my looks. We don’t get oppressed over here! …Yeah!\n\nHuh? What about the other summoned people? ……… Well, I guess it’s okay!\n\nAnd then the girl? Let’s live well and free in another world!>"
