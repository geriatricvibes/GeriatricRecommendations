	"description": "This novel is about Chen Feng, a down on his luck kid of unknown origin, and the famed trash of a backwater sect. He is so unlucky, he even ended up getting struck by someone else’s Tribulation Lightning. And yet, maybe not.\n\nFor when the Tribulation Lightning descended upon him, it triggered something that he had been carrying with him all this time, granting him a cultivation technique so powerful, it would turn his world upside down.>"
