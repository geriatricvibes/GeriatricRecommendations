	"description": "High school student Haruto Akihara, who is good at housework, has Rei Mikoto, the most beautiful girl in school, called the “Ice Goddess”.\n\nRei, a perfect superhuman, avoids socializing with others, and Haruto has hardly ever talked to her.\n\nOne winter day, Haruto returns to his apartment, where he lives alone, only to find Rei Mikoto there.\n\nRei is a distant relative of Haruto’s who has come to live in the same apartment with him. Rei rejected Haruto, saying, “I have no intention of getting along with you.”\n\nHowever, as a result of helping Rei who was being attacked and nursing Rei who had a cold, Haruto became closer to Rei. Haruto realizes that Rei, who appears to be cool, is actually a lonely person.\n\nOver the course of their shared life together, Haruto gently spoiled Rei, and Rei became dependent on him for his pampering.>"
