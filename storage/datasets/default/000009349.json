	"description": "The Emperor of Croisen hated Empress Yvonne. Enough that he'd wish for her to disappear three times a day.\n\nI don't like the face of someone who looks just like the Duke of Delois, my enemy, but no matter how much I insulted her, her indifferent and aloof character stayed the same, which made me feel even more terrible.\n\nI didn't care whether or not she disappears or dies. I was fine with anything as long as I didn't see her face.\n\nThe wish came true.\n\nWhen he no longer wished for it to happen.>"
