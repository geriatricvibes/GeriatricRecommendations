Moreover, no one in the family actually noticed this strange situation… Jiang Ziya possesses a strange left eye that lets him see things he shouldn’t be able to see. Usually, turning a blind eye to them is his life principle. However, something that shouldn’t be there has appeared in his house. This time, he can no longer continue pretending that he hasn’t seen it. So what should he do next?\r\n\r\n<em>This world has never been peaceful. Sometimes, just “seeing” things is dangerous. Facing the unknown, are you willing to choose to see – the truth?</em>>"
