With only four bare walls for a home, they don’t even have a woman to manage the household.\n\nThe Heavens had mercy today, Li family’s oldest son had saved a woman at the market and brought her back home.\n\nLi Man was killed by her mother-in-law and transmigrated. She was almost hanged on the first day, but, fortunately, she was rescued by the Li brothers.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that her destiny is over.\n\nThe language didn’t make sense at first, she discovered that, here, standard Mandarin sucks.>"
