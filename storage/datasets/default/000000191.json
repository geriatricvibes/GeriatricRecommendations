	"description": "Princess Shunde captured a jiaoren demon and wanted to find someone to tame it. The princess has three wishes: that the demon utters human words, that the demon's tail turns into legs, and that his heart will never be rebellious.\n\nEveryone knows that the East Demon Island, the West Demon Mountain, the South Demon Valley, and the North Demon Terrace are the only four places in the world that permit people with the ability to control demons. And the Demon Valley in the south has the strongest Demon Controlling Master in the world.\n\nShe was the most powerful demon master in the Demon Valley, but her heart was enchanted by a demon.>"
