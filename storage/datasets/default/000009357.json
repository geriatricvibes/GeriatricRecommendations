	"description": "In the world that when one becomes an adult (18yrs old), you’ll get a random skill.\n\nOur Protagonist Kurt just became 18, however what he got was not a Normal Skill.\n\nIt was a special skill that among the ten of the thousands only one can get, a Unique Skill.\n\nThe skill was 『RPG』.\n\nIt was similar to a character leveling their skills on the game.\n\nBut, not all unique skills are necessarily strong.\n\nAmong them exist outrageous tr*sh skills. At first glance, Kurt’s unique skill seems like tr*sh.\n\nBut, that is a terrible misunderstanding…… \n\nThe level rise if an enemy is defeated.\n\nAs the level increases, one can acquire Normal Skills.\n\nAn enemy whose level is lower can be defeated easily because of the level difference correction.\n\nEven a dragon’s flame is like a warm breeze in the face of the level correction. \n\nWhen it is properly raised, then its real value will surface.\n\nKurt’s Unique Skill is unmistakably a Godly Skill. \n\nThis is the tale of an adventure who became the strongest on the world that started from a small countryside village.>"
