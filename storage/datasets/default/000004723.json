	"description": "On the day of extinction, she saved the world and was burned to death.\r\nWhen she woke up again, she had returned to her childhood just before she was chosen to be the saint.\r\n\r\n \r\n“I’m sorry. I’ll die when the time comes, so I’ll live happily, my own way this time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paladin who committed suicide following the saint,\r\nThe priest who defiled his hands for the saint,\r\nThe tyrant who went crazy because of the saint and started a war.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis time, she will break off her relationships with them and live as an ordinary person, not a saint.\r\n\r\n \r\nBut why… \r\n\r\n \r\n“You look so pathetic that it’s impossible to let it slide.”\r\n\r\n \r\nWhy are they surrounding me, not the current saint?>"
