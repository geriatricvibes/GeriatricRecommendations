	"description": "In this pitch dark night, he hugs her tightly. \n\nHis breath got heavier and he embraced her tighter. Despite struggling for umpteen times to control his love for her, he just couldn’t control his heart.\n\n The person he is embracing now… is closer to him than any moment during the past few years. \n\nThis woman is the one he loves the most in his life and the only woman he loved before. Therefore, even though he may be making the wrong decision, this moment confirmed his decision. \n\nIt doesn’t matter whether it is wrong as long as she is going to accompany him during this journey. It seems that it is no longer important whether the future is bright or dim. \n\nHe knows clearly that he has been using the excuse of sympathizing and protecting her just to stay close to her.\n\n The fact remains – he just can’t bear to let go.>"
