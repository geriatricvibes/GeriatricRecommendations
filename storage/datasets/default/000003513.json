	"description": "Lou Fan is an ordinary person, nothing special. However, after being suddenly drawn into the mission world, he found himself quite special-very lucky to be exact!\r\n\r\nWhen other people's whole team is destroyed, his team passed with everyone intact; other people can't find equipment, they get rewards from NPC; other people's spirit weapons are used as decorations, while their spirit weapons leveled up like a rocket.\r\n\r\nLou Fan: Although I'm lucky, my strength is terrible...\r\n\r\nQin Tan: I will never waste time talking rubbish if I can just take action. Alright, who of you is my opponent?\r\n\r\nNPC: No! We just want to kneel down and call Dad!\r\n\r\nThis terrifying lucky king not only robs players of equipment, but the important thing is that he doesn't even let go of NPCs!!! A violent but unlucky guy and a weak but lucky king teaming up, the NPCs decided to resign. They couldn't do this job!>"
