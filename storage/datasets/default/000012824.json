	"description": "Shen Youbai is arrogant. Xu Pinyu belongs to him.\r\n\r\nXu Pinyu and Shen Youbai are students in the same grade, but there is a gap between them, the U-shaped school building. Xu Pinyu is in class K, where the grades are barely passible, whereas Shen Youbai is in class A, where there are elite students everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't stop Xu Pinyu's secret love for Shen Youbai. She secretly gave him roses, secretly cut the buttons of his shirt because of the school rumour, and intentionally violated the school rules and pretended to wear a short skirt in order to have more contact with him. Everything she did was for him, the one in her heart.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this dark unrequited love is like a solo dance, you can feel the sour and bitter feelings in it.\r\n\r\nBut what she didn't know about the other person, was that he had already fallen deep into the nightmare called 'Xu Pinyu'.>"
