	"description": "If life could repeat itself, what would you do?\n\nWould you repeat your first life and stay a normal average joe? Perhaps your gaze will betray the life you’ve already lived, but you remain insignificant and unknown, stretching your neck up high to watch the furling clouds roll by? \n\nOr will you make the world your stage, stir up every cloud and wind under all the heavens, making the entire world your captive audience as you dance, making people’s hearts pound with your every move?\n\nComposing my own laws, establishing the order I desire…a human life is a measly ten decades, so why don’t I light the candle that is my life and set this world ablaze!!>"
