	"description": "Tao Yuan was willing to take the peach blossom system to go to different worlds to complete the tasks, and the most important task is to fall in love. And every relationship must be very sweet. He must be extremely pampered before the task is considered complete.\n\nIn short, after hopping, he must be spoilt in every world, spreading dog food (affectionate love).\n\nWhite Lotus: I feel the deep malice from the world. If I am the protagonist, why did I end up a cannon fodder?\n\nSlag Man: This slap in the face came too fast- like a tornado. If God gives me another chance to come back, I will love him for 10,000 years.\n\nOnlookers: For God’s sake, take those two lovebirds away, we’re going to die of dog food!>"
