	"description": "“You never loved me anyway, right?”\n\nAstelle’s long-awaited marriage life ended in a day.\n\nShe worked hard to become Kaizen’s wife since she was ten, but the only thing that was left for her was the stigma of an empress.\n\nShe was abandoned by the royalty; the man she loved, Kaizen, wanted her to leave.\n\n“Yes. You’re right. I didn’t love you.”\n\nAstelle lied for the last time. The man was the reason for her life, but it was also for the sake of the man who was her husband for a day.\n\nShe thought there would be no contact with him again, but-\n\n“I think… I might be pregnant?”\n\n***\n\nSix years later, Astelle, who reunited with Kaizen, lied again.\n\n“You… who is that child?”\n\n“He’s my nephew.”\n\nTo protect the child.>"
