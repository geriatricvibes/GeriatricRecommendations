	"description": "Sett, the heir apparent to a count’s family, was kicked out, publicly due to an illness. He will soon prove to them that not being able to fulfill a noble’s duty does not make him useless. \n\nHe was thrown into a spaceship that was impossible to maneuver, with nowhere to go, and was given only ten days’ worth of food. It was like being told to starve to death.\n\nHowever, Sett was helped by a passing space pirate and succeeded in activating a space fortress left behind by an ancient super civilization.\n\nThe pirates suggested that he take the fortress back to the count, but he refused and decided to go with the pirates instead.\n\nWith this, a great war would break out that would involve all of humanity, with Sett being caught in the middle of it.>"
