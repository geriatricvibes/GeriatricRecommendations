	"description": "Xie Anran, who has multiple personality disorder, has three souls living inside his body.\n\nOne is a timid nerd, one is a cold pretty boy, and one is a flirty ladyboy.\n\nBefore he was reborn, Xie Anran was secretly in love with Sui Yuan, but did not manage to restrain the flirty ladyboy in his body who went to make a confession.\n\nSui Yuan’s face was full of rejection: “Go away.”\n\nThis time, the Xie Anrans collectively became “corrupted” and were determined to do anything in their power to capture Sui Yuan (no matter how dirty the means) and announce to the world — this male god is ours now!\n\nThus, Sui Yuan’s live streaming platform had three new anchors.\n\nOne is an unrivaled mid-laner ace, who talks with strength.\n\nOne is a prince of love songs, once his voice is sounded out, the melody lingers and reverberates in the air for an extended period of time.\n\nOne is a rare beauty who can adapt to many roles, such as pure, gorgeous, virtuous, or humble.\n\nAfterwards Sui Yuan discovered that they were all actually the same person.\n\nAnd so, this is a “I and I and I like you very much, let us four be together ~\\(≧▽≦)/~” story.>"
