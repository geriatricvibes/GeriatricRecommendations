	"description": "Okitegami Kyouko is a famous detective who solves cases in a single day. In fact, she has to, since her memories only last for one day before they ‘reset.’ However, for important things, she writes messages for herself down on her body with a special pen. One of her common clients is Kakushidate Yakusuke, a man who is often wrongly suspected of committing crimes. There is also a live-action drama adaptation of this story.\n\nThe original novel’s story is about a detective named Kyōko Okitegami who is also known as the forgetful detective. She forgets everything in a day, but solves cases the same day. (Her name has the Japanese word for “today” in it.) An unlucky young man named Yakusuke Kakushidate somehow ends up as the suspect in every case, and he always asks for the detective.>"
