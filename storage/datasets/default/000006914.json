	"description": "On the same day, Haruto Shijo receives confessions from three of the most beautiful girls in the school.\n\nThis is a big breakthrough for Haruto, who has been living a gray and dull school life.\n\nHowever, Haruto, who is suspicious, a nerd, and has a sultry personality, was not able to be honestly happy about it. Eventually, he misunderstood the confessions of the three women as ridicule.\n\nThinking that rejecting their confessions would be bad, Haruto chooses to go out with all of them.\n\nHe thought that the relationship would soon dissolve and things would go back to normal, but things did not go as he had imagined.\n\nOn the contrary, they find out that he’s dating all three of them, and things get ugly.>"
