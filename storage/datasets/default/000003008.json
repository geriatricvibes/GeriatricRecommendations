	"description": "Jiang Liu lost his father at the age of three. When he turned five, his mother decided to run away with another man. At the age of fourteen, he sent off the only relative he had, his grandfather, before carrying a small amount of property and stepping into the big dying tank called society.\n\nHe was stingy, selfish, and absolutely disgraceful. Except for breaking the law, he accumulated all the bad habits available to humankind. Yet, such a man, after an unexpected death, was bounded by a silicon-based creature called the Righteous Father’s system. Since then, he started his magnificent career in the world system.\n\nAfter several worlds went by…..\n\nRighteous Father’s system 001: [Shivering], I wonder if I still have time to change my host.>"
