	"description": "I was fighting with the heroine for the Empress’ seat.\n\nI, Yurina Carthia, the villainess, die at the hands of a mage supporting character.\n\nSo before the heroine gets a hold of him, I decided to find the young mage supporting character in the orphanage to sponsor him and pull him to my side.\n\n“Ray, I want you to remember what I’ve done for you today. And later when I’m in danger, you have to save me just like how I saved you today.”\n\nI only have one goal. To avoid death and survive by winning his favor. But then…\n\n“Don’t forget, Yurina. I’m the only one who can save you and kill you. So you have to stay by my side.”\n\nThe child, who I thought was a dog-like cat, has grown up to be an obsessive man!>"
