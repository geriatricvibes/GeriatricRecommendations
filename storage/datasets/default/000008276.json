	"description": "My 100th consecutive day of work. Over 150 hours of overtime every month without overtime payment was no longer a surprise. I couldn’t take it anymore so I decided to leave the demon army.\r\n\r\nHowever, for someone like me who could only use destruction magic unique to those with the potential to become the Demon Lord, finding a new job was quite difficult.\r\n\r\nI was looking at the notification board at the adventurer’s guild in a city within hero territory––\r\n\r\n‘Beginners Welcome! We fight evil! Personal Experience: After joining this party, I realized that the world is a wonderful place!’\r\n\r\nApparently there’s minimum wage and barely any work overtime. That alone makes it way better than the demon army. It seems like I’ll finally be able to live like a person so I’m going to go to the interview.>"
