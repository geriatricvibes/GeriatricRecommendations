	"description": "One day, Kim Jiho, who earns a living by pickpocketing on the street, leaves the facility he was living in after being hit by the owner of the facility. After walking on the street endlessly because he has nowhere to go, he sits down in front of the road and thinks.\r\n\r\nIf I get hit by a car and die here, it'd be good if it's an expensive car.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking like that, an expensive car stops in front of Kim Jiho, and the man who rides that car asks.\r\n\r\n'Wanna hop in—If you have nowhere to go.'\r\n\r\nKim Jiho, who thinks there is no goodwill without hidden intention, makes up his mind and follows the man. But the man doesn't make any demands after taking in Kim Jiho.….\r\n>"
