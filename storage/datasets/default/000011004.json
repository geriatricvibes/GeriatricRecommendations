	"description": "Crow was about to graduate from the Royal Military Academy.\r\nOne day, he heard a voice from the Saintly Sword that could only be wielded by the chosen Hero——\r\n\r\nThe Holy Sword── Excalibur spoke to him!\r\nThe voice came from Holly, the Sprite of the Holy Sword.\r\n\r\nThe Demon King that wanted to destroy the world would be reviving soon, so they had to find the Hero quickly, and hand the Holy sword to the Hero.\r\n\r\nCrow thought that delivering the sword to the Hero was a simple task, and will allow him to receive the merit of finding the messiah. He agreed readily, and went on a journey to find the Hero.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the problem child Crow partnered with Holly who had a horrible personality, their journey was filled with disasters! And the Hero they found was actually a slave girl—?\r\n\r\nHow were they going to bring her back...?\r\n\r\n'Why don't you use me to cleave the master of that kid in half?'>"
