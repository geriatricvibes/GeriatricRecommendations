	"description": "When I confessed my feelings to Sayahara Kiki, a classmate I dearly yearned for, she answered, '...I’m glad that you feel that way about me. Thank you very much.

I went to sleep with a broken heart, but when I woke up the next day... it turned out to be today again! Apparently, if you don't capture her heart, tomorrow will never come...!>"
