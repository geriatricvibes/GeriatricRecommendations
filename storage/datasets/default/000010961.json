	"description": "I am an abandoned black cat. Having not even been named, “I” met a human man one day. For some reason,  he couldn’t leave me alone, someone who didn’t know love. Which is why, I decided to go live with him.\n\n— Naming me Alexandria? You’ve got to be joking! Just imagining it gives me the chills. Oi, youngster, do something about this. Hmm, “Kuro”, huh. That ain’t too bad. You can call me that.\n\n—\n\nThis is the story how “I” not wanting to live, loved people so much that I prayed to cling onto my existence for the first time in my life. A story of how I spent 14 years with a human family.>"
