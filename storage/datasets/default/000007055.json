	"description": "The moment I was possessed by an R-19 tr*sh novel, I fell from the sky and into the arms of a mad villain, who was known as ‘The Wild Dragon of the West’ and ‘The Deranged Killer of the Desert.’ ​\n\nBefore I could even begin to understand the situation…​\n\n“I’m your bride?”\n”You fell from the sky, so you are my bride.”​\n\nWhy is this madman calling me his bride and hugging me so tightly?! Why does he keep muttering about the ‘prophecy’ being correct?​\n\nEdwin Crawford received a prophecy that foretold he would only survive if he married a bride who fell from the sky. As a result, I was destined to live as his bride, ‘Angelina.’​\n\nFurthermore…​\n\n“I’m a Jueri?”\n\n​To make matters worse, I’m a descendant of a race of fairies, who were hunted down and killed by the royal family. If I wanted to survive the royal family, I must join hands with Edwin.​\n\nStarting today, I will live my life ‘according to the will of the villain!’​>"
