	"description": "The end of the world has come, and zombies are rampant.\n\nIs having a game system against heaven? NO!\n\nShen Chi's bitter lesson told him that the price for taking the game system through the end of the world and paying for trust and acting high profile is to be caught and being sliced by the research institute.\n\nOn the day of his rebirth, Shen Chi decided to live with only one person for the rest of his life, even if he was the devil of all the people.>"
