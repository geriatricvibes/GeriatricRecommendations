	"description": "In the novel “Wealthy Ghost Young Master”, the male lead Shi Qi was ruthless. After Ning Meng died, she kept transmigrating into the people near to him.\r\n\r\nThe first time, when the male lead was 7 years old, she became his biased and malicious grandma.\r\n\r\nThe second time, when the male lead was 17 years old, she became his money-grubbing female desk mate.\r\n\r\nThe third time, when the male lead was 21 years old, she became his two-faced love rival.\r\n\r\nThe fourth time, she had completely transmigrated into the novel using her own body.\r\n\r\n——————————————-\r\n\r\nWhen Shi Qi was little, he carried a secret little diary with him where he recorded his grandma’s eccentricity.\r\n\r\nLater on, he realized that the person who was good to him wasn’t his genuine grandma, but a stray ghost who had only possessed her body.\r\n\r\nAfter he grew up, he also discovered that these eccentricities also appeared in the people around him……\r\n\r\n-Pretentious female lead who has Yin Yang eyes but is afraid of ghosts x Black-hearted male lead who could ward ghosts and was a man of actions rather than words >"
