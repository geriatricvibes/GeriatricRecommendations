	"description": "One morning, I woke up to find myself in the world of an otome game.\r\n\r\nI've been a company employee for twenty-five years, and I'm an alpha male with a family, but suddenly I've become a merchant boy named Glen Alford.\r\n\r\nSo this is the otherworldly reincarnation I heard about. But I don't remember dying at all!\r\n\r\nThe world I've arrived in is the otome game 'Eleanore! \r\n\r\nIn order to find a clue to return home, I entered the game's stage, 'Royal Sarun Afia Academy,' but I'm not even a mob, I'm 'less than a mob'. I don't care what it takes, I want to see my wife. I don't have a single reason to stay in this world.\r\n\r\nNo matter who, what, or how they say, I'm going back to my own world!\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a forty-seven-year-old salaryman who set out to return from the game world to the real world.>"
