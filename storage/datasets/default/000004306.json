	"description": "Among the orcs, a race whose mind is filled with nothing but lust and food, a certain individual was born.\n\nHe uses rational thinking to control his sexual urges, thanks to a unique outlook on life.\n\nOne day, he found a certain book mixed in with the belongings of a human his companions had abducted.\n\nThe book described a gentleman’s way of life: showing kindness to women and children, and never forgiving evil deeds. After reading this book, he decides to become a gentleman, though this particular book speaks of how to become both a respectable, and lecherous, gentleman:\n\n'A gentleman helps those in need. He is soft-spoken and has a gentle heart.'\n\nHowever, mixed in are writings about immoral and salacious activities, which he mistakes as the way to becoming a gentleman-by-night.\n\nWith both of these as guides, he proceeds to make the women of various races slaves to his libido.>"
