Haven't you always said that any man who can get taken away easily isn't yours?'\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the veil falls off, Scarlett finally decides to take revenge on her friend.\r\nAnd soon, in front of her friend , she kisses her friend's fiancé deeply.\r\n\r\n'I'm the one who is sorry for not seeing your evil intentions, but you shouldn't have thought that I'd stay a idiot forever.'\r\n\r\nAll of these are revenge from me.\r\nDirty and promiscuous.>"
