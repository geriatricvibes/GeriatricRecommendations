	"description": "Shiyu, a modern-day chef, was minding her own business one day when she was hit by a car and her body died on impact. Her soul transmigrated into the body of a beggar in a strange world.\n\nTo her surprise, Shiyu found that she knew this strange world.\n\nIt was the fictional world filled with cultivations, powerful immortals and magical things created by two of her best friends (both professional novel writers). Shiyu loved this fictional world so much that she begged her friends to write her into the novel. These two terrible friends agreed and wrote her in as a beggar.\n\nShiyu really wanted new best friends...\n\nEspecially now that she had found herself transmigrated into the life of this pitiful beggar! What second chance at life? Money is needed for food and shelter you know? Also, as dregs of a society that valued strength and bullied the weak, beggars were the most bullied and taken advantage of, ah!\n\nModern soul Shiyu refused to give in to fate. Let us improve our life together. Fellow beggars, we are a family and I will not let any of you starve!\n\n>"
