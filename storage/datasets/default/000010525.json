	"description": "She had done everything to help her fiance start the business. Unfortunately, she was betrayed by the jerk and the mistress.\r\n\r\nAfter jumping from her apartment, she was reborn...\r\n\r\nDuring this particular lifetime, she swore she won't attack others unless she was attacked. If she was attacked, she must remove out the source of trouble...\r\n\r\nSo she started a perfect plan to revenge them. However, she became the prey of a man...\r\n\r\nThey were tacit business partners in public, courteous and backscratching.\r\n\r\nIn private, he held her in arms, 'Your success depends on me. It's time for you to repay me!'\r\n\r\n'Hey! No! You can't take off my clothes!'\r\n\r\n'I'm your boss, why not? '...>"
