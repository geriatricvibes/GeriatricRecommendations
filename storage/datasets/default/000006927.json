Whilst the newbie adventurer Kazuma continues to steadily make a name for himself –, Dust is busy setting people up in scams, selling stolen products, ripping off noble ladies, and the like. ‘Let’s make some money today too!’ Whilst he was doing so, he was told an ominous prophecy by the great devil Vanir: “Thou hast a interesting future ahead.”>"
