	"description": "This is a warm story that happened in the entertainment circle.\n\nA two-faced and sharp-tongued director top X Earnest and tranquil actor bottom\n\nThe story began on a rainy night. When the “Good Samaritan” Mr Yu lent a hand to a drunk “middle-aged uncle”. He was captured and interviewed by a small local television station, commending his willingness to help a person in need and saying how he was a good model to the citizens. The next day, Shen Yu’s name, an actor who had been in the industry for many years and yet still remained unpopular, became a hot search online in a way that he had never imagined possible. His awkward yet polite smile was screenshotted and accompanied by various trendy emojis and memes, made into sticker packs.\n\n…On the top floor of a luxurious hotel, a certain someone, who had just awoken with a hangover, was browsing through Weibo with widened eyes, “Who the hell wrote this article?! Is that reporter blind?!” \n\nHis assistant asked, “Boss, shall we thank this Mr Yu?”\n\n“Impossible. Hmph, there’s no one who can make me acknowledge myself as a ‘middle-aged uncle’.”>"
