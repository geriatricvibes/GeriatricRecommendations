	"description": "Liu Yin’s aunt was the empress and her father was a powerful official in court. Her brother was a general that possessed strong armies. Liu Yin was the typical cannon fodder. Yet, these people wanted her to marry the crown prince!\r\n\r\nLiu Yin transmigrated and became the selected brainless crown princess. She felt a lot of pressure from her role. \r\n\r\nEveryone in the capital knew that the crown prince hated the Liu Family’s legitimate daughter. He avoided her as if she was a snake or scorpion. Up until people saw the god-like crown prince carrying the hem of the Liu Family’s legitimate daughter’s dress on a palace banquet!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nUnder the moonless night, the man’s gaze darkened as he held the petite woman in his arms. “You drugged me?”\r\n\r\nLiu Yin’s face reddened. “I didn’t! I didn’t! Don’t spout nonsense!”\r\n\r\nLiu Yin was speechless.\r\n\r\nBecause perverts usually find excuses for themselves [faint smile].\r\n>"
