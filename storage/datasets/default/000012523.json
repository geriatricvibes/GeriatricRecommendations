	"description": "Liu Yuan is a good game player, especially in the MMORPG Upper Center. Just as he succeeded in gaining the favorability of all the possible characters in Upper Center, he transmigrated. To where? Oops, he transmigrated into the game he was playing.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw was a pretty girl. She wept incessantly, failing to notice Liu Yuan’s unusual behavior. She looked up with teary eyes and said in a firm way, “Mr. Junxuan, I will not marry him. I wish to be with you for the rest of my life!” Junxuan… Wasn’t that his username in the game?>"
