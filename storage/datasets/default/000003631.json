	"description": "An edict bestowed marriage.\n\nA noble daughter with three strikes:  no talent, no looks, no virtue.\n\nA trash wangye – disfigured, disabled, seriously ill.\n\nEveryone says: Perfect match!\n\nBridal veil down–she wore a shallow smile.  Leisurely and calm. Having experienced life and death, she only wanted to lead a quiet life.\n\nGoing up to the wedding hall–he had a slight smile on his face; a heart as cold as ice. He suffered all kinds of humiliation, but there will be a day when he will stand above all beneath the heavens.\n\n–He is my husband.  To bully him is to bully me. To insult him is to insult me. To hurt him is to hurt me. If someone were to hurt me, I would have to get to rid of them!\n\n–Benwang doesn’t believe in supernatural beings and doesn’t seek heaven. If she were to die, benwang would turn this entire world into purgatory and sacrifice this whole country to her!>"
