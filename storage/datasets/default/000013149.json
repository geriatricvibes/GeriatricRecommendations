	"description": "The curio shop siblings are troubled. The older brother and younger sister were fortunate enough to have a second hand shop in a town near a dungeon and adventurers flourished, but as soon as the dungeon was captured the recovery medicine stopped selling. Every month they continued to go in the red and if this continues they will be out in the cold. There the two mustered their wisdom to think about the recovery medicine they’re selling. When thinking about it, why were recovery medicines inconvenient and illogical? The liquid stored in the bottle and such, they were heavy and would spill and you won’t be able to drink it if you don’t use both hands during combat. It will be more simple, usable at the necessary time and effect will be great. While developing such dream recovery medicine, trade grew to an unexpected direction. The result of advancing the optimization of the recovery medicine to the utmost limit was that a new dungeon was born! The story that is spun with great effort and bonds by the curio shop siblings with strong commercial spirit begins now (big lie).>"
