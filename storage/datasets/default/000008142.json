	"description": "Soft romantic lighting highlighted a bed engulfed by rose petals, yet the thing that truly took Qi Nian’s breath away was Ji Yanxin, who was kneeling on one knee in front of her.\n\n“S-Stand up and speak.”\n\n“Have you ever seen anyone standing when they propose?” Ji Yanxin clearly could not hold back his smile.\n\n“I, I’m not ready…”\n\n“I’m already five years older than you, so I’m prepared to wait an eternity until you are ready… You don’t need to worry about trivial matters like family responsibilities – the only person you’ll be responsible for is me… I’ll deal with any other complications if that puts you at ease… The only important thing… is that you are willing.”\n\nBlinking back the tears in her eyes, she, as if deliberating every word, slowly responded, “I do.”\n\nBecause… I had already fallen in love with you at first sight.\n\n~~~\n\n“I Really Want To Be With You” is a light comedy novel. It tells the story of a female manhua artist who took the initiative to talk to the cold and distant professor to obtain inspiration, and lastly, takes a leap for love.>"
