	"description": "I, a normal, serious, upbeat young adult, somehow, fell into a really unserious SM r*pe 18+ novella.\n\nOh, it’s a ‘transmigration,’ so just live and let live with the foreknowledge of the plot, I hear you say?\n\nBut it was the moment I opened the book, that everything went black, and I got sucked in.\n\nIt didn’t even give me a f*cking chance to memorise it for dictation.>"
