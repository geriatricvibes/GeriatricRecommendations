	"description": "Master said: “We are fox spirits. The greatest calling in our lives is to leave the mountain to seduce men.”\r\n\r\nThus began the journey of a lifetime for a foolish little fox spirit who had always followed his master’s orders to a T. He promptly toddled down the path of no return as he went on his merry way to seduce men. Yet, before he could even make his way out of the mountains, he was scrambling back to his master again, scared out of his wits by a demon catcher who happened to be passing through.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about a fox spirit who tried his hand at seducing a scholar, only to end up in the bed of a demon catcher.>"
