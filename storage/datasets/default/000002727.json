	"description": "On the first day of school, Wei Ru Song accidentally fell in front of Xiao Nian’s dick. With his girlfriend witnessing this incident and thinking that he was giving another man a blowjob, this led to a series of misunderstandings.\n\nWRS: I’m not gay, I’m not gay, I’m not gay!\n\nXN: Neither am I.\n\nWRS: It seems like we need to come up with a scheme to clear our names now.\n\nXN: OK.\n\nSo…\n\nCounsellor: I saw you and that junior doing it in the grass, *cough*, kiddo, please take note on not being a bad influence.\n\nWRS: No, we just fell accidentally…\n\nNeighbour: Wei Ru Song can you be quieter in bed? We couldn’t sleep the entire night.\n\nWRS: No, that was just Xiao Nian giving me a massage ah…\n\nGym Teacher: You guys know what you did in the equipment room, go clean the mats!\n\nWRS: Noooooooo!!! That was just the milk I spilt!!!\n\nFinally…\n\nXN: Senior.\n\nWRS: Yeah?\n\nXN: Since they already think we’re gay, why don’t we just let this work itself out.\n\nWRS: … Just what I was thinking.>"
