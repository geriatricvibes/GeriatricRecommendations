	"description": "Does free will truly exist? Does man truly exist?\n\nOkky Madasari explores the seminal questions of mankind and humanity in her latest novel.\n\nA struggle arises between the two main characters, Sasana and Jaka Wani, in the search for freedom from all restraints â€“ from those of the mind and body, to restraints imposed by tradition and family, society and religion, to economic domination and the shackles of authority.>"
