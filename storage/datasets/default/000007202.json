	"description": "High schoolers Tooru, Makiko and Shizuka all have past memories of reigning as the Three Great Demon Kings of another world in their previous lives. All three were brutally killed by a hero.\n\nThe three of them established a ‘Past Life Confession Club’ in high school and spent their time reminiscing and talking about their painful past lives together as well as doing their best to get through high school safely.\n\nOne day, however, a new teacher arrived at the school and set off a dangerous flag:\n\n[Your battle is about to begin]\n\n\nThis is a story about the displacement and loneliness of three people who reincarnated once again into their own world, 2000 years after their first death. They started their 3rd lives with their memories from both lives intact. Here, in this new yet old world, they would rise to become Demon Kings once more.\n\nHow would their new lives be like as they repent, reflect and meet each other once more, all the while running away from the Hero’s shadow?\n\nThe setting of this world is based on the original draft of ‘Asakusa Demon Bride’s Diary’ and ‘Tales of Reincarnations in Maydare’. However, please note that this is a completely different story.>"
