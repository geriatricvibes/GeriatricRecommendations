	"description": "“Xu Hui, Xu like promised, Hui like brilliant glow. What about you?”\r\n\r\n“Bai Lu.” (Literally translated White Jade but a homonym of White Egret)\r\n\r\n“Oh, like ‘A flock of egrets in the sky?’”\r\n\r\nBai Lu smiled.\r\n\r\nLu (Jade) and Lu (Egret), she and him are like this one word difference.\r\n\r\nThe beginning is not great. When they first met, he was lonely, jealous, and escaping from everything, as if the whole world was his enemy.\r\n\r\nShe was quiet, petite, wearing glasses, had thin eyebrows, and her presence was faint.\r\n\r\nShe was different from the other girls who always approached him. She was silent and indifferent. It was as if she didn’t exist, yet there were traces of her everywhere.\r\n\r\nBai Lu calculated every step she took, carefully in control of the pace. Neither hot nor cold. Like a shadow.  \r\n\r\nShe said: “You knew that you are different.”\r\n\r\nXu Hui smiled humorlessly, his body shifting. He sat up straight. The smile on his face had not dissipated. He said nonchalantly, “How so? Do I have two heads?”\r\n\r\nBai Lu’s voice fell lightly on Xu Hui’s lashes, “You know that it’s so easy for people to fall for you.”\r\n\r\nXu Hui froze.>"
