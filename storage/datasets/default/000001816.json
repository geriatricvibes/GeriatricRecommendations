	"description": "There was a special patient in Spruce Hospital. A person in vegetative state and coma that the tree doctor, So Lee-yeon, has been hiding for two years…\r\n\r\n‘Don’t wake up. Please don’t wake up.’\r\n\r\nIt was her dream to live quietly so she prayed every night. Then one day, by pure miracle or failure, the person in vegetative state woke up!\r\n\r\n“Did you come to suck this poor bastard’s dick?”\r\n\r\nIn front of the man that lost his memory and common sense, she told a lie that couldn’t be turned as she was afraid of his murderous instinct.\r\n\r\n“I’m your w-wife, Kwon Chae-woo.”\r\n\r\nTo the man who buried someone alive and tried to kill her two years ago!>"
