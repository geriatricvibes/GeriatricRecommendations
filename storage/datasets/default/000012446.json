	"description": "‘Sophia, the daughter of a Marquess, is a villainess who seduced the Crown Prince, despite having a fiance already, and his close aide during her time in the academy. She did whatever she pleased and was banished by her half-sister, to be the bride of a Madman who lives in a remote region.’\r\n\r\nWhile that kind of rumor spread throughout the capital, Sophia isolated herself in the library inside the mansion of the man whose nickname was ‘Lord Hart, the Math Freak’.\r\n\r\nHowever, the real Sophia was actually a History geek who rarely expressed herself but a well-spoken lady. Thus, she received the nickname ‘eccentric shut-in’ from the Lord himself. \r\n\r\nLord Hart only demanded her to bear his heir but aside from that, Sophia was free to do anything and immersed herself in books all day long. Yet, she was required to attend a ball together with Lord Hart due to some circumstances. \r\n\r\nAs Sophia stayed with that detestable man, she was slowly getting to know him more. >"
