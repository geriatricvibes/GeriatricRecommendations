After the operation became success, the person she hated the most, did not appear in front of her ever again.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that the person she despised the most, was willing to give up his sight just so she will not suffer anymore…\r\n\r\nWhen Zhou Yizhi wanted to see him, she received a shocking news that he died from a plane crash…\r\nShe didn't know how she came back to when she was 15 years old, but she knows that in this life she will definitely treat her brother better.>"
