	"description": "Duan Jiashu: I would rather starve to death and jump from here, but I won’t sell CP with You Xin!\n\n*The camera pans*\n\nDuan Jiashu: It’s really good, selling cp with You Xin feels really good.\n\n—\n\nYou Xin, a low-tier idol, is known for his agent marketing his CP’s to grow popular over the years, but the ships involving him always led to a “bad end”. Duan Jiashu on the other hand, is a popular actor who detests selling CP and even has a hobby of reporting CP content that involved him.\n\nWhen the two both star in a variety show, You Xin tries to stir up CP with Duan Jiashu, but before he could even make his move, the other already treated him like air. Unexpectedly, after their earlier scuffle, Duan Jiashu himself proposes to sleep in the same room as him. Even more unexpected was that when their CP started to grow popular without his agent’s marketing strategy, Duan Jiashu himself proposed to sell CP with him. But according to Duan Jiashu, his proposal isn’t selling CP, it’s just “acting”.\n\nYou Xin: isn’t this the same thing?!\n\n“CP is fake, but happiness is real.”>"
