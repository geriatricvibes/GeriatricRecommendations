	"description": "Lin Yao has lived for more than twenty years and has never liked anyone.\r\n\r\nHowever, when she finally has someone she likes, the person turns out to be so cold and sharp-tongued, and he doesn't seem to be fond of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'What if someone you like doesn't like you back?' a friend asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'I am chasing that person.' Lin Yao said confidently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story has a bloody name, 'Chasing the God of Men Every Day', which is a mudslide of a hipster. This is a hilarious and funny story of a gangster woman who chases a man.>"
