	"description": "The news that Song Yu had hanged himself exploded in an ordinary morning; churning, cracking and burning for a month before subsiding. People slowly began to accept the fact that the pride of the entertainment industry, the youngest movie emperor, had passed away.\r\n\r\nOnly Zhou Yanqing didn't believe that the person he regarded as a beacon of life would end his life so easily. He began to investigate the truth behind Song Yu's suicide. When he slowly approached the truth, a strange car accident made him reborn to two years before…\r\n\r\nHe was like a butterfly in the tropical rainforest of the Amazon River. He flapped his wings two years before and changed Song Yu's life ever since.>"
