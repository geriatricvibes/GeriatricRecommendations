	"description": "Ye Chen’s mission was to correct the villain’s three views and thus saving the world.\r\n\r\nShe bled for the villains, she blocked swords for the villains, she raises those villains to be fat and plump, three views upright.\r\n\r\nWho would’ve thought —\r\n\r\nThe villains she raised, Are! All! Dead!\r\n\r\nThe System recalled painfully: “This won’t do. Host, you can no longer be so good towards the villains. Otherwise, they would fall in love with you. It would create too much of a shock to them when you run away after you finish teasing them.”\r\n\r\nYe Chen nodded.\r\n\r\nThe next world…\r\n\r\nSystem: “AHHHHHH, Host, what are you doing! Stop! Don’t treat them so well!!!”\r\n\r\nYe Chen pulled the knife out of her body and looked at the shocked man in front of her with a gentle smile.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, she burst into tears like a violent storm in her heart: “T T Sorry, as a face-judger, I couldn’t control myself when I looked at this face.”\r\n\r\nThe female lead is a scumbag that was heartless but pretends to hold deep affections. The male lead is an unreasonably true loyal dog and male god.>"
