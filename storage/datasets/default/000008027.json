	"description": "In the harsh land, I would do anything to survive. Even if it is selling myself to others. An arrogant and beautiful man who came across that way, a dangerous deal began. \r\n\r\n'Let's say I give you and your family enough support to live and eat comfortably for a lifetime, so what can you give me?'\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing I could give to save my family. 'I'll give myself.”\r\n\r\nThe arrogant but beautiful devil glanced at me, leaning obliquely on the bed.  \r\n\r\n'What are you doing, without lying down?' It was the beginning of the entrapment that I could not escape. \r\n>"
