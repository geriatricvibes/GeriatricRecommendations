She had been dressed as a man all her life, and her younger sister left a will to live normally.\n\nWear a pretty dress, meet a good man, have a lovely child, be happy…….\n\n‘In other words, wear a dress, meet a man, have a baby.’\n\nAccording to her sister’s instructions, she will marry into a marriage set by the enemy imperial family. Not surprisingly, the assassins come to the wedding night without a groom. \n\nIt turns out her husband is Theo Astolf, the enemy who destroyed his country?\n\n…Well, he won’t even recognize it anyway.\n\n“I want a woman who can survive by my side until the end.”\n\n“I need a husband who can give me a child.”\n\n“…What?”\n\n“Baby, There’s no way to make it by myself. Can you help me?”\n\n“…….”\n\nThe moment when the interests of a woman who doesn’t know what’s normal and a man who’s never been ordinary coincide. \n\n“…Huh, yeah! It tickles.”\n\n“That sounds good. Can I continue?”\n\n“Ah! Archduke, I, uh…….”\n\nA romance that they didn’t even know began.>"
