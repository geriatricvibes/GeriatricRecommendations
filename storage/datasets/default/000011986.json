	"description": "It was fated, him and him.\n\nAlthough, being fated didn’t always mean a happy ending for both of them.\n\nAt least for himself, it was just one big…temptation.\n\nCompared to his own weak and frail body, he was more masculine and full of warmth.\n\nIt wasn’t strange at all to find himself falling deeper and deeper….\n\nBut no matter what, he could never let him find out about his true feelings.\n\nOr else, they would never have become friends.\n\nCrap! He found out! Why did he have to get drunk and blurt out the truth?!\n\nHe’s in deep trouble, with no other choice but to avoid him…\n\nHe…he approached him, asking to be in a relationship with him?\n\nWas…was it a prank? He would leave after he was done playing with him…\n\nWas he right? Could the sunshine boy he fell in love with be so cruel?>"
