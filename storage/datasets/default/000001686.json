	"description": "She is the scheming and vicious descendant of the Ghost Doctor Sect who accidentally transmigrates into the number one trash in Phoenix Shadow Country. After taking possession of the body, she breaks the seal on her martial soul and shocks the world in incredible ways! \r\n\r\nHe is the Ghost King, whose mere mention of his name causes everyone to tremble with fear. Everyone thinks of him as being coldhearted and merciless. Yet he feigns blindness just to win over her heart… It is only until he reveals his true colors, that she realizes he's a big scheming wolf! \r\n\r\n“Do you know that you’ll be struck by lightning for pretending to be blind?” A certain woman gnashes her teeth audibly. \r\n\r\n“If I hadn’t done that, how was I going to dupe you into coming home with me?”>"
