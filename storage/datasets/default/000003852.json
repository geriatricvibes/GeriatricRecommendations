	"description": "Zheng Yi never really hated Chen Gong to begin with—— Chen Gong’s heavy-browed eyes even once gave Zheng Yi butterflies.\n\nBut Zheng Yi couldn’t stand Chen Gong’s indifference towards him, especially not when Zheng Yi wore his own nervous heart on his sleeve.\n\n“Do you resent me because I’m your superior?”\n\n“…?”\n\nA workplace romance between the hot-headed, overqualified director Zheng Yi, and the aloof assistant director Chen Gong.>"
