Here, everyone lives a peaceful and fulfilling life.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this other world was――at peace.\r\n\r\nWhat's my plan for the future? For my limited stay here, I will live this world to its fullest; going on a cultural exchange, sightseeing, then, after experiencing the festival that is only held once every ten years, …… I shall safely return home.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite my lust for a peaceful last year before returning, this planet's heavyweights have begun amassing around me, and......>"
