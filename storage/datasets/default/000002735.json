	"description": "One day, the ‘Good Witch of the Lake’ was asked by her crush to make a love potion, and thus, was heartbroken.\r\n\r\n–If this is the first and the last, then let me be together with him for at least a little bit longer.\r\n\r\nTo at least extend the time, she began ordering as many materials as she could. That's when the Knight took a notice of her staple food--a lettuce. For somewhat unknown reason, the Knight began to come and eat as well.\r\n\r\nStarring a Hikikomori witch with lettuce as her nutrients source, and the serious yet also arrogant Knight–a romantic tale that started from a Love Potion.>"
