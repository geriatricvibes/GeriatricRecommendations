	"description": "When the apocalypse’s greatest villain self-detonated to destroy the world, Shen Qingjia died and was reborn a month after Doomsday. No power, no gold finger, no space, no way to gather food, just opened her eyes and not long after has to face fierce zombies!! What kind of non-mainstream rebirth is this ah?!\n\nEscaping, she met a cute girl with a beautiful voice but found that she was the villain who killed everyone. For the sake of the peaceful and sustainable development of all mankind and her own safety, Shen Qingjia decided... to relentlessly reform (fall down with) her! !\n\nShen Qingjia, 'What you want to do?! I don't like girls... Don't suddenly rush over!... So soft, I won’t accept, ah ah!!!'>"
