If one day he suddenly becomes a masked superhuman in a tight suit with a swinging boa tail behind him, hands with long spider hair, and a drooling pig face under the mask, even so, you can still remain calm and pull him into your embrace.”\n\n“There is only one possibility: my eyes are blind.” Ke Bu is a real person. He understands that love is not great to this point. If you really become like that, Zhi Li’s first reaction is absolutely to send himself to the Scientific Research Institution. >"
