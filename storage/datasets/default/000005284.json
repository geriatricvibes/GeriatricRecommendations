	"description": "Julia, Queen of Semele, has a problem. It is because her husband, Endimion, was the same age as her. They have been a married couple out of convenience since childhood. The two are like siblings, having used the same bed for 12 years and gone through puberty together. But one day, their relationship changed… \r\n\r\n“Do you really have to sleep in the same bed as me? You should fix this habit. Otherwise, the concubine who will carry your child will be disappointed...”\r\n\r\n“A concubine who will bear my child?”\r\n\r\nIn an instant, their eye-level changed. In a daze, Julia looked up at Endimion climbing on top of her body. \r\n\r\n“My child, I will make it with you.” \r\n\r\nHer hair stood on edge to his breath tickling behind her ear. Julia bit her lips tightly. After the unsavory incident, it is really uncomfortable sleeping in the same bed with my husband. Please, can't we use two beds?>"
