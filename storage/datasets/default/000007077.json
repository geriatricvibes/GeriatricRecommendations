	"description": "My name is Renze(錬是). I’m a hunter who searchs for planets fit for reclamationー better yet for development.\n\nHowever, a failure happened and in this uncivilized planet I had to do a emergency landing. I decided to live a survival lifestyle with the Mate Gear called Eleksia YM10.\n\nEven so, when there’s Eleksia YM10 who’s a Mate Gear everyday necessities are done perfectly, also Eleksia will guarantee that food is prepared, unexpectedly, a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nBesides, this planet, some way or another seems to have been populated by humans. The mere shadow of what it was, desperately human-like creatures are inhabiting in great number.\n\nAltough it’s a major discovery that will remain in history if it’s confirmed to be a planet with intelligent life who’re not earthlings, even more are not even from mankind, well since I can’t really go back I’ve decided to enjoy the remainder of my life here by making friendship with these creatures.>"
