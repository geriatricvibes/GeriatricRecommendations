	"description": "Song Zhiyu x Cheng Po\r\n\r\nOn my way to Cheng Po on January 20th, 2022, it snowed for the first time in my life. \r\n \r\n—--\r\n \r\nWhat do we live off?\r\n \r\nIn “Persimmon Apartment,” the unknown author wrote: \r\n \r\nLiving off the poverty of these corners, living off what has not been spoken, living off the chronic issues of life, living off these again and again, we are nearing death. \r\n \r\n—--\r\n \r\nLiving off silence and tears, some nights I watched you and your flashy tattoo that contradicted your cold temperament. We lived off departures, a first-time chase, a reunion that has not yet happened, and a train that is determined to go north amidst the heavy, drifting snow.>"
