	"description": "Lee family books, the book store Joo Hee ran for many years, is notified by a termination of lease out of the blue. Since she cannot sit on the street like a homeless person, Joo Hee visits Park Shin-woo, the owner of the building and chairman of Hansung Group.  But the first meeting with the owner of the building turns into a naked meeting where she happens to run into his bare chest. What was even worse? He has even made a strange suggestion to go out with him for three times without any preconceptions.…. \r\n\r\n“Can I make a suggestion?” \r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n “If you go out with me three times, I will think about rewriting the Lee family books’s lease contract.” \r\n\r\nThis is the strange romance between Joo Hee, a woman who has to somehow keep Lee family books, and Shin Woo, a man who tries to tie her up. \r\n\r\n‘Her Bizarre Night Guest’>"
