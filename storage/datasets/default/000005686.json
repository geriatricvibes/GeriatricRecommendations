	"description": "With one sentence from Qu Chenzhou, he killed Prince Liu’s family.\n\nThe reason was that he was the sword in the hands of the emperor, and the Prince was a thorn in the emperor’s eyes.\n\nBut the words were what Qu Chenzhou said himself.\n\nAfter the Prince defected, he vowed that one day he would surely throw away his bones as ashes,\n\nAnd for this word, he waited for the Prince in the capital for many years.\n\nUntil he died.\n\nHe confessed that he was sinful, and he didn’t ask the Prince to understand his secret help over the years,\n\nHe just wanted to pay off his sinful debt.\n\nSo in front of Prince Liu, he died in the most tragic manner.\n\nBut he didn’t see the Prince holding his body in pain, almost in madness.\n\n“——Qu Chenzhou, how dare you lie to me!”\n\nYuande’s seventh year, Winter.\n\nQu Chenzhou died, and all parties clapped and cheered.\n\nExcept for one person who seemed as if he had lost everything.>"
