	"description": "Apparently, I, a popular doujinshi artist, had died due to pushing myself in finishing up my new summer release.\r\n\r\nSo I was called by a masochistic fat god, who’s a fan of my work, to reincarnate into another world. And due to this fat god’s preference, my body’s now that of Lily the Succubus, a character from my work! And my power’s proportional to the times my books have been ‘used’!?\r\n\r\nNonono, that’s weird you know?! Hey, Butagami! Let me hit you, dammit!!>"
