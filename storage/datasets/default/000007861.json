Am I the villain that the protagonist will kill? If so, I will kill the main character and you.”\r\n\r\nIn order to stay alive, I begged the villain to bring in and raise a protagonist who could break the curse. So my life could be saved.\r\n\r\n“You cried when I died in the novel. Do you like me?”\r\n\r\nThis madman thinks that I like him!\r\n\r\nA survival parenting where a woman moves into a novel and raises a young protagonist with a villain who thinks she likes him!>"
