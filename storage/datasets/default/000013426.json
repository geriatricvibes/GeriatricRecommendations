	"description": "Xie Guanze woke up to find that the world had changed and that pets had become elite people! His neighbor’s Alaskan Malamute is taking the test to become a civil servant; the cockroach is helping the bear child with his math homework; his sergeant’s monkey is helping teach his grandson how to fight to become a school bully. \n\nBy contrast, his parrot is a good pet. He not only became the head of the food department with his cooking skills, but also led the osprey and seagull to start a business, hunted and cooked alive, and successfully launched a chain network Red Restaurant. After his rise, the parrot did not forget his original intention. He still went with him to eat and live together and took good care of his master with delicious food. \n\nAt night, Xie Guanze was content to lie in bed, “Life is only three meals a day, enough… Eh?” \n\nIn the quilt, the parrot’s voice was deep, “After three meals, we should do the rest.”>"
