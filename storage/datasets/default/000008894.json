	"description": "'Emperor Laskaris! Let's pull out your eyes and get rid of future troubles!'\r\n\r\nThe year when the promised future got closer than ever. The supposedly delightful Christmas gift contradictably ended in a devastating ruin. And even the Empire began to fall on a hellish curve.\r\n\r\n'I don't care if I become a villain. If I can change my civilization and the fate of my country, I will gladly call it my burden.'\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1258 AD, with a memory of 50 years between dreams and reality, eight-year-old Ioannes Laskaris woke up from a long sleep and the world around him changed forever!>"
