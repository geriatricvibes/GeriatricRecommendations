	"description": "The young ‘monster tamer’, Shinra is an ally of monsters, creatures that live off mana, aiding their interactions with humans. He lives quietly in the forest, and is suddenly entrusted with something — the beautiful girl Alessa, carrying a small dragon! He accepts her when she says she has nowhere to go, and with Ruri, the girl that lived with him already, the three (and the dragon) start to live together, and Shinra teaches the joys of the world to Alessa.>"
