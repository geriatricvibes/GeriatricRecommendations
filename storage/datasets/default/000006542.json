	"description": "After crossing over to Naruto World, Shiranui Yuuji found that there was an incomparably terrifying Godzilla in his body.\n\n“You are Tailless Bijuu? Your chakra is astonishing…. What a coincidence, so am I.”\n\n“You know Bijuu’s coat? I don’t have Bijuu’s coat, but I do have Godzilla Coat-”\n\n“Bijuudama is terrifying!! It can destroy a mountain as soon as he sends it down?”\n\nHiss, that Bijuudama scared Yuuji, he quickly moved his hands to form seals,\n\n“Nuclear Release – Atomic Breath!”\n\nWhen Yuuji turned into Red lotus form, Godzilla pressed Nine-Tailed to the ground.\n\n“Nine-Tailed, your strength is too strong. You need to be fried…”\n\nNine-Tailed, “?”\n\n“What Jinchuriki are you exactly?”>"
