	"description": "Due to the shock of having my engagement broken, I was able to recover the memories of my previous life. This is the world of the otome game of my previous life, is not it? If so, then as the villainess I'll get caught up in the battle between the heroine and the demon king and die…… please tell me this is a joke! If this is so, then I'll avoid that death flag by conquering The Last Boss (Demon King)!\r\n\r\nThis is the story where the villainess gives the heroine, her former fiance, and childhood friend their just deserts, starts her own enterprise, increases subordinate (manservant) count, and gets loved by the Demon King.>"
