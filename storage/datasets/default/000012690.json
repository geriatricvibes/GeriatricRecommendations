	"description": "The story of a nun who was deceived by the devil.\n\n***\n\nMy throat hurt. When I touched the nape of my neck, where a subtle pain throbbed, I felt tooth marks. I bowed my head as if possessed and swallowed my tears.\n\nThe traces of love affair remained intact on the body covered by the hair… The dirty sheets and the backs that complain of pain…\n\n“Is this a dream?”\n\n“No…”\n\n“Please tell me it's a dream, please!”\n\nEven if I didn’t have a lot of faith, it is not. This wasn’t really it!\n\nThere was a reason I had such a dream out of nowhere.\n\n“What do I do, even when I die now I will go to hell…!”\n\n“Don’t worry, I’ll take you well.”\n\n“Saying such a terrifying word!”>"
