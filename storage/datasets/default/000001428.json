	"description": "In the previous life, Xu Ruan was arranged by the head of the family and married Ji Cheng, a soldier in the same village. She listened to the nonsense of her good sister, misunderstood Ji Cheng’s personality, divorced him and fled the village, and lived in a big city.\n\nIn this life, she went back to the night she married Ji Cheng and had a drink, and saw that the swelling after Ji Cheng took off his underwear was huge. She had done this thing in her previous life and couldn’t close her legs all day long.\n\nShe felt that she had misunderstood her past life. He looked handsome, lived a good life, and had a particularly strong stamina, so she didn’t want her husband who was so drenched in water. In this life, she must make up for the lack of husband and wife life in the previous life, and continue to live well with Ji Cheng in this life.>"
