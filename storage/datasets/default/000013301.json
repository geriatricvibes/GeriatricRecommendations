	"description": "Franz is a recent graduate of magic school who is having trouble finding a job - he constantly bungles interviews due to his poor communication skills. With all the major magical jobs out of his reach, there’s only one place left for him to go.\r\n\r\nThe industry of black magic. Known for being Disgusting, Dirty, and Dangerous, Franz is incredibly hesitant to actually enter such a market until he no longer has a choice. With his back to the wall, he talks to the Black Magic Incorporation’s CEO, who tells him the truth - black magic has shed its harmful exterior, and has instead become Pure, Pleasant, and Permissive. In short, Black Magic Inc. has actually become a white company. >"
