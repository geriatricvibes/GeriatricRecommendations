	"description": "It’s the era of Transmigration.\n\nI wanted to possess a body of a rich young lady in a Rofan childcare novel, and live while receiving lots of love.\n\nNo. 1 to be avoided!\n\nNo. 1 in frustrating the reader!\n\nI possessed someone inside an infinite return novel called: Return Until the World is Saved.\n\nForget being a young lady from a prominent family, I will soon be ruined because the survival difficulty of the original work is S-Class.\n\nI became an extra. Ellet, the young daughter of a servant in the Count’s manor.\n\nWe are poor, but it’s a happy life between a kind brother and a good father.\n\nI’ve got a best friend I’ve never made before because I was always busy.\n\nEven the gods of the Transmigration Management Bureau are openly fond of me.\n\nI’m living a life full of confidence.\n\nOn top of that, I accidentally bought the ‘After-Life Insurance’ full package just before my death.\n\nI leveled up with the high-speed growth buff, and diligently destroyed the original plot.\n\nThanks to plenty of special privileges, I came to give satisfaction for all the frustrated readers of the original work.\n\n“You wiped your face with your dirty hands.”\n\n“…….”\n\n“Don’t be surprised. It’s because I have an obligation to be kind.”\n\nAnd then, there’s the protagonist who is still nothing more than a handsome push over, Thesilid.\n\n‘Why is he being this crafty with me?’>"
