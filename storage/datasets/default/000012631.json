(ladyboy – a male that plays a female character in game)\n\nGuild Member 2: Pei Pei Pei, ladyboy your ass! Dare to call my sister-in-law as ladyboy, come to Yan Nan* (A place’s name, where players use for PVP)\n\nGuild Members: …\n\nLittle Wudang thought to himself, you can’t blame me for disappearing, it’s because the school internet got disconnected.>"
