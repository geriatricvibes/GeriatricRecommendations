	"description": "A simple childhood love story.\r\n\r\nThe female lead’s name is Xiao Tu (Bunny) and the male lead’s name is Ling Chao (Super). As neighbors who were born a month apart, they grew up, went to school, and graduated together.\r\n\r\nTu Tu is a cute and good girl. Even though she’s not really smart, she’s not stupid. Since she is skilled in martial arts, the guys are scared of her.\r\n\r\nLing Chao is smart and cool, but also stuffy and quiet. He is the brainy type who excels in studies.\r\n\r\nTu Tu’s mother wishes her daughter would grow up and marry Ling Chao, but her father disagrees and wants Tu Tu to get to know other boys.>"
