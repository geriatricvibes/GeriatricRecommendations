	"description": "I went to bed after completing the blockbuster eroge game that had become a trending topic in the past few days. When I woke up, I noticed something was different. Somehow, and for some reason, I got reincarnated in the initial stage of the same game that I was playing before.\n\nThe most concerning part was my character. I was playing the role of a character who challenges the hero and gets defeated. In addition, all the routes of this particular character have been confirmed death.\n\nI got reincarnated as an underdog, and the situation is even worse, because someone has already defeated me in a duel. I can’t escape death anymore. But I won’t give up. I have the knowledge of the eroge game that I had cleared in my previous life. I will make full use of it and try to survive.\n\nThis is a story about our hero who got reincarnated as an eroge underdog character, and is trying his hardest to survive.>"
