	"description": "I reincarnated as the wife of the cursed Archduke in my own twisted novel.\n\nAs the author, I have a responsibility to fix this novel.\n\nI have lifted the curse, which is the main problem of this story.\n\nI thought my job was done. But when I was trying to go back, the Archduke asked me, “Did you really think I wouldn’t know that you’re planning on returning to your fiance?”\n\n‘My fiance?’\n\nWhat I’m gonna do? He completely misunderstood the situation!\n\nAll I want is for him to please let me go home!>"
