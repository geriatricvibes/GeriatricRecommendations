	"description": "I noticed him 10 million years after I woke up.\r\n\r\nWhen I was born, the Milkyway was still a young galaxy – of course, it is also young today, and the existing universe is only 14 billion years old. Everything is new. I’m at the edge of the galaxy, closest to other galaxies.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I noticed him.>"
