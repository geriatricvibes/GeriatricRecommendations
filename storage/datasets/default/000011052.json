Instead of falling in love and making great memories, I found myself cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry for the students of Adergart knight academy.\n\nEventually, I somehow traveled back to my former world, however... one year later, I returned once again! \n\nWhat? \n\nMoreover, it looks like 10 years have passed here? And it seems that the birth rate for females decreased drastically, which led to the start of the multi-husband system?\n\nLast year’s young boys who aren’t married yet, are now chasing after me.\n\nA heartwarming love and inescapable reverse harem story.>"
