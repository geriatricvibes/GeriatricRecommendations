	"description": "I am Ye Qing. Lucky I found a [Monster Factory] application.\n\nThis bunch of super strong monsters are individually comparable to over 100 human beings, and they bring all kinds of skills!\n\nEfficiency? With the skill processing speed +300, you still want to compete?\n\nPrecision? *cough, cough* Bring me that legendary dial caliper, let’s show them what absolute precision really mean.\n\nYe Qing: When, us, men want to be successful, we pull out our wallets.\n\nMonsters: Don’t play those malice games with us. The creation of ultimate machinery is our love and life. These impenetrable bodies are our tools of the trade.\n\nA 20 meter tall, overly buffed, savage looking monsters hold on to a ultimate cutting machine and yelled at the sky: “I am not targeting anyone specifically! Rather I am telling you all that, everything, in front of me and my tools are, nothing, but TRASH!”>"
