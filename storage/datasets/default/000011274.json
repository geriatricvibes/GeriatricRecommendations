	"description": "Dreams are the visualization of desire - a doorway that can lead to the depths of a person’s heart; it can embody their deepest yearning,  to such a degree that the consciousness and experience of incalculable ancestors can be passed on. In the vast boundless universe, there exists such a people. They can enter dreams, explore it, change it, use it, and manipulate it. They call themselves Watchmen.\n\nAt only the age of sixteen, Jiu Jie encountered an unforeseen event. Since then, he became one of them, a Watchman - to set foot and explore dreams riddled in the mysteries of no return. But in the wake of manipulating dreams, as his abilities continued to grow, a world-shaking secret began to emerge.\n>"
