	"description": "\r\n\r\nShe thought the man was dead.\r\n\r\nHis raven black hair, long eyelashes, sharp jawline and plump lips.\r\nAs she was treating him, Swan fell in love.\r\n\r\n“I-I think I’m pregnant. So, uh, take me as your wife…”\r\n\r\n“……..”\r\n\r\nAll because of ‘love’. Oh to be condescending as a young girl. The man didn’t love Swan, she was only a toy of momentary interest for him.\r\n\r\nAtlion never answered her question.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“You’re the one who said you wanted me. Didn’t you say you’ve never regretted a day that you were with me?”\r\n\r\n“Heart is something that changes as much as we want, Your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nIt was hell.\r\n\r\nHer words seemed to make my blood vessels harden.\r\nI always want to see and touch her, but she won’t allow it anymore.\r\n\r\nI’m afraid of you.\r\nYou, who don’t love me.\r\n\r\nThe story of Swan, who once loved a man with lost memories- “Atlion”. What will become of this perplexing romance?\r\n>"
