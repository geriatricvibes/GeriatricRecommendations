	"description": "I’m Izumi Nobusada. 35 year old, just a humble clerk of a convenience store.\n\nWhen I was enjoying my consecutive holidays that I hadn’t had for a long time, it was just my luck that I seemingly got summoned to another world. Furthermore, a former demon lord interfered in this summoning.\n\nThe former demon lord told me, 『Please listen to my two requests if you become strong. You can live freely besides that.』 Usually here, I should have been the one who got my wish fulfilled shouldn’t it? Well whatever. The former demon lord made my body younger as a farewell gift. I’m gonna say goodbye to my introvert past self and do my best.\n\nAim to become! Mofumofu King!?>"
