	"description": "The only real villainess in the novel brought in a man with a beautiful appearance and tamed him for life. He learned to beg her after forcing his fear to his limits, and he became into a beast from which he could never escape, even if she freed his leash. However, the beast falls in love with the woman who saved him and becomes the emperor, with his savior by his side, enslaving the villainess for all eternity.\n\nI recall this scene where the male protagonist was being tamed. …What am I supposed to do?\n\nFirst of all, let’s unwind the brainwashing little by little.

He kissed the palm of my hand briefly, then slowly removed his hand>"
