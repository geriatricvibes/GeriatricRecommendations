	"description": "Traveling through the Xianxia world, Chen Chen got the strongest tracking system and was able to track everything ever since. \r\n\r\nChen Chen, 'System, I am short of money.' 'Two meters away, your father has hidden some money under the bed. Five meters away, there is a rusty copper coin buried half a meter underground.' 'There is a piece of silver in the grass ahead.' \r\n\r\nChen Chen, 'System, I need some luck.' 'The sh*t in front of the pigsty is actually not ordinary.' 'Go to Black Peak cliff twenty miles away to jump off the cliff.' 'Somewhere hidden there is a fairy cave mansion. Please explore by yourself.'>"
