	"description": "In this world, it is no longer uncommon for domestic pets to suddenly become people.\n\nAs an inexperienced romance writer, Chen Qi never imagined that one day her dog named Huidan would become a human.\n\nWhen Huidan just turned into a human:\n\nTeach him to dress, Huidan struggles and shakes his head: woof woof!\n\nTeach him to eat, Huidan plunges his head into his rice bowl.\n\nTeach him to speak…Chen Qi flips the table.jpg No more teaching, no more teaching!\n\nHuidan in the eyes of Rhubarb: He is cold and silent, but he runs really fast.\n\nHuidan in the eyes of Grandpa Liu: He has a talent for cooking, but he doesn’t like to talk.\n\nHuidan in Chen Qi‘s eyes: How could I raise such a s*upid dog (disgusting face), don’t bother laozi!>"
