	"description": "Feng Xi, a scholar, also a thief master by avocation. His life goal was stealing things all over the world. Even after he was dead, he still couldn’t rest in peace. As a result, one of his theft caused a great war between Gods and demons… After knowing about the truth, King of the Netherworld gazed at his sweetheart who seemed to feel so guilty, or was only tittering, for a long while…\n\nFeng Xi, with his head lowered, admitted his fault in earnest, “Sorry, it’s my fault!”\n\nAfter a brief pause, King of the Netherworld said, “Next time, don’t forget to bring me!”\n\nFeng Xi raised his head with puzzle while staring at the king with his two clear eyes.\n\nThe king, as calm as the look on his face was, added, “I’ll clean up the mess for you!”\n\nFeng Xi was in a daze for a long while. Then he nodded vigorously like chickens pecking on grain.>"
