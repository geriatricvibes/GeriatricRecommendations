	"description": "I became a side-character who died in anguish because of her good-for-nothing husband.\r\n\r\nIf I can’t avoid getting married, why don’t I change who I marry instead?\r\n\r\n“Excellent, marriage sounds good.”\r\n\r\n“Wise choice. Then let’s have a wedding ceremony that isn’t too ceremonious. Following that, I’ll need you to go down to the Fief and behave like the lady of the house until I call for you. Naturally, there won’t be any time to spend in leisure whilst dousing yourself in luxuries.'\r\n\r\n'I’m not marrying you, but your father instead.'\r\n\r\n“......Pardon?'\r\n\r\n'I’m not going to marry you. Do you have a problem with that?'>"
