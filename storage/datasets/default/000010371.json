	"description": "One day, unfortunate news flew all the way to the Mage’s City. The mage, Solar Xing Ayra’s, entire family had been killed in an accident. Thus, he must now become the next Lord of the Solar family.\n\nThe childhood home he returned to felt unfamiliar and strange. He barely managed to conduct a funeral with advisors that regarded him with suspicion. After fainting from various stressors, he woke up and…\n\n“Hello, Master. Nice to meet you!” ^o^ From now on, I’ll be the cute GM spirit fulfilling Master’s dreams: 'Adventuring the world!', 'Fun estate management!'  I’m so happy to be with Master from now on, yay!\n\n“Enter a name ______”\n\n… What is this pebble-like spirit that calls me ‘Master’?\n\nNo matter how you look at it--these level-up quests and these system windows…they were similar to a game’s user interface from his previous life.\n\nWhat is this… thing that seems more suited to modern civilization? Reminiscing on the games he had longed to play, Ayra worked hard on the quests. And, slowly, he also began exploring the territory.\n\nHowever, the territory…\n\n[D-234 days until the fall of the Solar estate.]\n\n“There are 234 days left till ruin…?”\n\nAlright, let’s start with the coronation ceremony. Things will work out somehow.>"
