	"description": "In the doomsdays, Xia An, who had the power to raise her beauty died. As soon as she opened her eyes, she found herself inside a novel in which the female lead was abused!\n\nBut the original owner she transmigrated into turned out to be a mother of a psycho villain! Moreover, the body was as delicate as Princess Pea, and the soul was as fragile as crystal.\n\nThe short-lived cannon fodder survived only in the memory of two men— the female lead’s father as his first love and her villain son who hated her to death!\n\nWhen the poor Xia An looked at her six-figure money in her bank, and card balance, and then at the screen full of a scandal, exposing her villain ‘illegitimate son.’\n\nXia An’s face changed!\n\nShe was thrilled!!! \\\\ (* ^ ▽ ^ *) /\n\nXia An: Hehe! I did not expect that all my dreams in the doomsdays were fulfilled! It’s a paradise here!\n\nThe heroine of the doomsdays who became beautiful day by day after getting transmigrated into a novel!>"
