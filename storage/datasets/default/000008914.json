	"description": "Last night I woke up without any recollection of what happened to me, just like I was born yesterday.\n\nBut then again, you can’t prove the existence of “past.”\n\nYou could have just been born right now and your whole memory was fabricated.\n\nThat is what I am feeling right now; lost, confused, and unsure.\n\nSo yes, I might have just been born last night, but somehow my “past” is chasing me.\n\nI can’t remember it, but apparently I caused a private aircraft to crash.\n\nDamn, I wish I can just remember something!\n\nMy name, I don’t even remember my own name! But why?\n\nWhy instead of my own name, I know who is responsible for what happened to me?\n\nThat’s not all, I’m not even sure that I am human. Not after what happened today.\n\nI literally stopped rain. No, not like that. I didn’t turn the weather from pouring to sunny, no.\n\nBut I, how do I put it…\n\nI made thousands of raindrops cease to fall, suspending them into the air as if gravity don’t work around me.\n\n…\n\nI understand, I think I will have to put an end to this.\n\nMy name is ———, let me tell you a story about me.>"
