Duke Atelien's beautiful illegitimate child, Chesney, became a barbarian bride through an arranged marriage, for the sake of the state religion.\r\n\r\nBut her husband, Emperor White of the Belcansus Empire, leaves their bedroom amidst their consummation on their first night.\r\n\r\n“I'm a married person.”\r\n\r\n'Did he love you to the fullest?'
