	"description": "I possessed the villain and final boss of the original novel after once complaining about the story.\nHe is Ki Yoon Jae, the incompetent representative of the gifted guild!\n\nIn order to survive without dying immediately, he needs to make an ally. But... \n\n[Let's predict what will happen if Ha Hyun Seo were to discover that you are not Ki Yoon Jae.] \n\n“So, you’re not him? You're not Yoon Jae hyung?” \n\nIf you reveal that you are possessing the original to your allies, it’s game over.\n\nAt long last, I met the main character who gave me a death flag from the original story. \n\nThat's how it was for a year.\nBut when an unknown gate appeared in Korea, I received a strange skill from God. \n\n[If you have this, you too can become gifted! You can borrow abilities through kissing!] \n\nSo... Do you want me to kiss those gifted people? Besides, what's up with the look in the eyes of the bastard around me? \n\n'Don't you want to know what my abilities are? How to use them, how they feel...”\n'As I’ve always said, I'm on your side. I'll do whatever you want.' \n\n[No matter what kind of life the player lives, God will watch over you. God bless you!]\n>"
