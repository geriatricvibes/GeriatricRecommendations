	"description": "A doctor died from over exhaustion in his previous life and reincarnated inside the empty body of the deaf and retarded sixteen year old son of Da Kang’s number one official. Whether or not this can be considered lucky, one cannot tell. Due to his tiring and jaded life as a doctor, he decided to live out this life as one pampered and loved by a beautiful wife while being surrounded by his descendants. He desired to live the leisurely lifestyle of the rich son of an official, but contrary to expectations, a reversal of his fortunes ruined his plans. As a rank 9, low level official, how can he rely on his medical and surgical skills to toy with the jianghu and court in the palm of his hands. Please watch me as I use my doctor’s hands to rule the world!>"
