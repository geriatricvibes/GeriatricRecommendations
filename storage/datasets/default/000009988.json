I’ve already married the other sister, though?!\n\nOn top of that, in order to protect Shishino from her family situation, I’m now living with her before living with my actual wife…..! What in the world is going to happen to both my reasoning and my newlywed life?!\n\nA never-seen-before, unpredictable heroine race begins!>"
