	"description": "The shy and oftentimes awkward high school girl Asahina Wakaba is forced into a ‘Punishment Game’ by her classmates. She has to pretend to confess to the practically undateable boy Iruma Haruto and go out with him. Their relationship starts out plagued by guilt and depression. However, as Wakaba starts to discover what the boy is really like and how he treats those around him, her own melancholic student life starts to blossom into something greater than she thought imaginable.>"
