	"description": "Kiryu Shouma, an employee of Arasa Company, resigned from his job. He was thinking where he should go next, but found himself in a different world after walking out the company doors.\r\n\r\nIt was a world with monsters rampaging around, yet the goddess who summoned him didn’t gave him a single skill. In fact, he already has the power and skill needed to overwhelm the people that summoned him. That is because during his “Chūnibyou Phase”, he obtained a skill called “The Overlord of Variant”. He wasn’t able to use it in his former world but can in this wold.\r\n\r\nThus, by using the power he obtained, the journey to build a country in the new world has begun.>"
