	"description": "Okay then, this is actually a dark fic combining the tropes of mafia stories, modern rebirths, old cucumbers pretending to be young, younger tops, and more… (I can almost see the lightning… trembles)\n\nAhem, but since I’m not your stereotypical author, our bottom is also not your stereotypical bottom, and our rebirth…\n\nIt’s also not your stereotypical rebirth.
