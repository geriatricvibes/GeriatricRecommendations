	"description": "As the daughter chosen by the Heavens, she was already extraordinary from birth. However, with her talents concealed, she was treated like trash and mercilessly betrayed. So, she decided to let her supreme capabilities shine!\r\n\r\nFrom then on, her bloodline had been awoken. Everything was possible—refining antidotes and weapons through alchemy, taming the dragons and phoenixes, and even being the ultimate ruler of the world. Since then, millions of people admired her and she lived up to her name as the strongest concubine in the world!\r\n\r\nOnly that cold, evil and immensely domineering Ice Emperor, whom she had accidentally provoked, loved, protected and helped her everywhere…\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, after he has treated me like that, how can I ever like someone else? This man is really cunning!”>"
