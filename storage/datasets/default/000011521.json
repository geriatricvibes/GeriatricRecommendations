	"description": "“You…!! You’re s*upid!! Die!! You should die right now!!”\n\nAs soon as I was taken out to the rooftop by the school’s “Saint”, a beautiful blond-haired quarter girl named Itsuki Sana, I was suddenly shouted at.\n\nIt all started when I, Suzuya Kaoru, found out about her “secret”.\n\nWhat became clear was the true nature of the “Saint-sama”, a blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty with super high specs… In fact, she was a disappointing, clumsy beauty who emitted strange noises when she became embarrassed.\n\nThis is a slapstick coming-of-age love comedy with a super high-spec (But disappointing) Scandinavian JK that the students at the school adore!>"
