	"description": "Ye Qing transmigrated into a novel. She was only an unimportant character in the novel, and she was free to live a wonderful life by herself.\n\nBut, her happiness was short-lived. One day, an adorable girl that looked around three-year-old popped up and called out in a milky voice, “Mom.”\n\nYe Qing: ???\n\nOn another day, a cute and handsome twenty-something guy hugged her. With tears in his eyes, he said in a voice that was full of affection, “Mom!”\n\nYe Qing: ????????\n\nAfter Ye Qing had somehow inexplicably become the mother of two children, she discovered –\n\nNeither of these children were human!\n\n***\n\nOne day, a little girl pulled a certain big boss to the side to whisper, “Dad, mom was patting my head when she was telling me a bedtime story. I felt too comfortable, and I accidently swung my tail out. Mom seems to have seen my tail. What should I do? QAQ.”>"
