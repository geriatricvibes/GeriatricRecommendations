	"description": "Bai Duanduan fell in love at first sight with a man in the long queue outside the restaurant. He had bushy brows and cold expressionless face and even the slightest frown made him look like the most handsome god from the heaven. \n\nShe decided to take the initiative, and when confronted with her request to exchange numbers, the other man gave a charming smile, and then –\n\nThe handsome man took Bai Duanduan’s waiting number and swapped it with the number he had just taken, “Oh, number 89, it’s coming up, so I’ll give you my number 250. ”\n\n “……” \n\nThe other party smiled gently, “Thank you.”\n\n “……” \n\nDuring the second encounter, the undeterred Bai Duanduan decided to try again, but just as she was about to strike up a conversation, the man picked up his ringing phone – “Who is the other party? Who is their lawyer? Bai Duanduan? Want to settle? No way.” \n\n“There is no case in this world that I, Ji Lin, cannot win and no executive that I cannot fire.” \n\n…… WTF!  Was she blind to fall for Ji Lin, the well-known oddball in the legal circle!>"
