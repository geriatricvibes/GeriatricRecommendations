	"description": "He is high above, the mysterious and terrible King of the Wild. With one glance, he can see people’s romances. He hates women to the extreme, but at his first glance of her, he dotes on her and spoils her.\n\nShe is a humble transmigrator, a miracle doctor who doesn’t care for the many handsome men around her. She only wants to become strong, to be worthy of that god-like man. But when she’s finally sure of her feelings, she finds out she’s already been married for years…\n\n……\n\nWhen wronged：\n\nShe uses strength to hit the big handsome iceberg-like man in front of her eyes. “People say that I’m not good enough for you, but it is you who is an old cow eating tender grass!”\n\nA man seizes the main point and laughs like an evildoer. “This husband has to eat the grass to confirm if it is tender or not!” He puts out the red candle……\n\n……\n\nThe world says：\n\nThe barbarian king has no heart and has no passion.\n\nA pregnant woman very miserably thinks,” If he has no passion, then who is responsible for this big belly?”>"
