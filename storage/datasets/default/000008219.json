But I love you!】\n\nXiao Chen is an ordinary person, but the world he lives in is never ordinary.\n\nVarious bizarre deaths and spiritual events happen around him.

Why is Xiao Chen still not dead???\n\nLate passerby: WHAT? Why is the Boss in a relationship with Xiao Chen???\n\nXiao Chen: ????\n\n>"
