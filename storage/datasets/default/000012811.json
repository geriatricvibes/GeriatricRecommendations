	"description": "Hojo Emu, who works in the Department of Pediatrics and the Cyber Rescue Center at Seito University Hospital, receives a package from an unknown sender. Inside is a gashat labeled “Mighty Novel X”. No way, it’s a challenge from the genius game creator Dan Kuroto! No, he’s supposed to have disappeared. Who in the world would make something like this…? Emu meditated and took a deep breath. His hesitation eased, and he put his finger on the activation switch of the gashat. Game start!\n\nThe novel takes place three years after the events of Kamen Rider Genm vs Lazer.>"
