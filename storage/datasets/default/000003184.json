	"description": "The entertainment industry’s top star Jiang Ye, became a ghost trapped in a cemetery after his death. \n\nHe never expected that the man kneeling in front of his grave, facing wind, rain, and thunder——turned out to be the big boss Xie Chen, who terrorized the business world with his ruthless methods! \n\nThe media’s evaluation of this mysterious person was: Cold, Noble, Wealthy, and Indifferent. \n\nJiang Ye looked at the man kneeling in front of his tomb stone for 7 days and nights with a dazed expression. This man stubbornly insisted on engraving under his name the words: Eternal life, My love.\n\nJiang Ye: ???\n\nJiang Ye, who was now a ghost, left the cemetery with the boss. He found that as long as he stayed with him, he could touch anything as if he were still alive and that no one was able to see him. \n\nBig boss Xie Chen looked at the youth who was eating and drinking leisurely while being undressed. His mouth twitched slightly and his cold and noble temperament hid his darkened eyes.\n\nShou Jiang: No one can see me.\n\nGong Xie (pretending not to see): I really can’t see it.>"
