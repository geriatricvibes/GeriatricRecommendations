	"description": "“I’ll gladly welcome Archduke Barthian as my husband.”\n\nElena Selum got married to the Archduke of the North to avoid the crown prince’s proposal to become his mistress.\n\nHowever, the attitude of the Archduke greeting Elena as his bride is cold.\n\n“No matter if you were southern, you are now the Barthian Duchess. You’d better stop thinking that you can be as shallow as before.”\n\nThe secrets of her beautiful husband were revealed one by one.\n\nTired of her nightmare-like husband and her harsh life in the north, Elena decides to leave him.\n\nWill she be able to get out of the grip of the Barthian Archduke as she wants?\n\n* * *\n\n“There’s only one thing I want from you.”\n\n“I apologize in advance. I refuse to hear anything.”\n\nTheodore, who held on to Elena’s waist, firmly refused.\n\n“Why are you doing this to me? You hated me. My hair, my eyes, my clothes, everything I had and did was detestable– you only hurt me!”\n\n“Elena…”\n\n“Just don’t say that you’ve come to sincerely love me.”\n\n“Then, please forgive my silence now.”>"
