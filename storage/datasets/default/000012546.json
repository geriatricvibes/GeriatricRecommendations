	"description": "If a man is honest, courageous, exceptional, not only can capture attention but also cook, lives across from you, of course you should push him down. \n\nIf a woman is kindhearted, sharp, smart，quick-witted, not only protective but can also solve cases, lives across from you, of course you should eat her.\n\nQiao Yin very clearly remembers her first meeting with Xiao Yang. She thought that he looked pretty handsome. They were neighbors for four years, she never thought that one day he would become her man. A lawyer and a policeman, two busy occupations, originally deemed impossible to be together, however due to one case, it started their life of “possibilities.”\n\nOne is a foodie and one is a chef, one talkative one quiet. One caring and one cold. >"
