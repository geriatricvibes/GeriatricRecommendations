	"description": "As the father of a hero, Nick spent most of his days fighting demons with his daughter. Until his unnatural strength and crude personality was too much for his daughter and got him chased out of her party.\n\nWhen he went running into town with nothing but the clothes he was wearing and started causing trouble, what he found there was a treasure of a time long gone, a magical relic that could speak words. They were a couple ( ? ) who acted together in their mischief, but Nick who is so far removed from having any semblance of common sense always had trouble waiting for him…\n\n[You bastard, why don’t you ever think before act!?]\n[Hahaha! I do think! But it’s just faster to start punching instead!]\nThis is the heartwarming tale of a meathead father who became excessively strong to protect his beloved daughter and of the mysterious magical relic that was caught up in his indecent acts and unceasing troublemaking.>"
