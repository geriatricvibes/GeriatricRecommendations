	"description": "In the general’s house, the eldest daughter is born again.\r\n\r\nIn the last life, she mistakenly regarded the fish as a pearl and misunderstood the wolf.\r\n\r\nIn this world, she wants to expose the stepmother’s Buddha-snake heart and tear the sister’s hypocritical face.\r\n\r\nThis life, let me see how she protects her parents, keeps younger brothers, fights stepmothers and step on stepsisters.\r\n\r\nWho will harm/betray her, she will return back a hundred times more, conspiracy against conspiracy to eliminate all! I want to stay away from the royal family, never want to become the imperial concubine, yet unexpectedly I can't escape from his love net!>"
