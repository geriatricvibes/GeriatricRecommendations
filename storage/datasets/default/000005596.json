Marry me!\n\nThe room of a university student with zero love experience, Tsukasa, has become the hangout spot for his younger sister, who made her debut as a yankee when she entered high school, and her friends.\n\nOne day, he found a bulge on his bed and flipped over the cover to find Erika, the most beautiful girl among his younger sister’s friends, asleep.\n\n'Ah, sorry... My period just makes me so sleepy'\n\n'You’re too frank, I don’t know how to respond to that...'\n\nUnable to leave such a naive and free-spirited girl alone, Tsukasa started to drill her in manners and common sense.\n\nFalling in love with Tsukasa, without hiding her feelings of 'love', Erika makes a ferocious approach on him! On the other hand, Tsukasa was also charmed by her upfrontness as she tried her best to learn what was taught to her. \n\nThe love life of a yankee high schooler and a caring university student begins!\n>"
