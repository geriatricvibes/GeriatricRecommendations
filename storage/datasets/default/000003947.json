	"description": "Jeonghan meets his cousin Il-Jo, who he almost forgot existed, at his uncle’s funeral. Feeling sympathy for the impoverished Il-Jo, Jeonghan impulsively suggests to live together, which he soon regrets.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“…….”\n\n“What do you have to say for yourself.”\n\nHe asked because he discovered Il-Jo secretly trying to kiss him while he was asleep. Jeonghan attempts to kick out Il-Jo but, in the end, fails to do so. Instead, he asks how Il-Jo can get rid of his unrequited feelings.\n\n“Just kiss me once.”\n\n“If I do that, will that help you like me less?”\n\nOn the pretext of sympathy, Jeonghan slowly gave his heart to Il-Jo. Before he knows it, he finds himself to be sexually involved and possessive over him.>"
