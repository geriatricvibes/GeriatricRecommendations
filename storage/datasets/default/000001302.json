	"description": "Lackadaisical and rebellious in nature, Erwin Friar, a young noble, whiles away his days in the company of seductive hostesses and his equally lackadaisical friends. Little did he know that his life was about to take a drastic turn after a book by the name of “Laws of Space and Time” was bestowed upon him, seemingly by chance. \r\n\r\nSoon, Erwin finds himself embroiled in the center of a series of sinister plots that tear his life apart by the seams. Armed with the mysterious copy of “Laws of Space and Time” and a newfound sense of purpose, Erwin sets off on a journey to uncover the truth behind his own past and space-time magic itself.>"
