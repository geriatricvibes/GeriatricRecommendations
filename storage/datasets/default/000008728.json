	"description": "Delcia gave her heart to her beloved lover, Edwin.\r\n\r\nSo her lover survived, but the result was indescribably disastrous.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for your sacrifice for me.”\r\n\r\n“......'\r\n\r\n“I also knew very well that you and I were lovers in the past.”\r\n\r\n“......'\r\n\r\n“But it was me in the past who loved you, not the present me. Because now I don't love you.'\r\n\r\nThe cold gray eyes stared at Delcia.\r\n\r\n“I will give you enough compensation for your sacrifice. So let's break up the marriage.'\r\n\r\n“......E-Edwin!”\r\n\r\n'If your marriage is blocked, I will take responsibility for that as well. By introducing you to a good person I know.'\r\n\r\nEdwin, who said that, was still alive in Delcia's heart.\r\n\r\nWith the side effect of not remembering Delcia.>"
