	"description": "Hello, everyone! My name is Shen Jianguo. I am a night school instructor teaching ideological development and Marxist philosophy, occasionally analyzing recent policies and measures for my students.\r\n\r\nAll my classes are held in the middle of the night; I've never seen my coworkers or students during the day. The training institute's classrooms are all in abandoned schools, hospitals, or residences. The license plate number of the bus that picks me up is 444; it always arrives at my house at precisely midnight and disappears at five in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhat? You're saying I've met a ghost? Impossible! As a staunch scientific materialist, I absolutely don't believe there's any such thing as ghosts!\r\n\r\nI've only had one problem recently: couldn't the training institute hold its classes a little earlier? Wouldn't around 8 PM do? I fear neither heaven nor hell, but I do fear going bald.>"
