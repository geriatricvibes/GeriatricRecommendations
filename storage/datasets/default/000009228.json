	"description": "The protagonist, a video game fanatic who spent his junior high and high school years at an all-boys school, is reincarnated in a different world that looks a bit like a nostalgic nurturing gal game! The heroines in the game are unbelievably cute. But unlike games where you can just press commands, you really have to work hard to raise your status. This is a romantic comedy that combines various galge elements into a strange otherworldly love simulation.\n\n>"
