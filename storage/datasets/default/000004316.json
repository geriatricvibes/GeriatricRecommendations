	"description": "After the nth time of failing a marriage meeting, Xiang Han got himself a job: good treatment, high salary, free world traveling with food provided, house provided and even a 'lover provided'?!\n\nAt first, he thought, apart from having to travel into the body of a scum cannon fodder, a scheming fake white lotus, everything else was okay. It was only later he realized that saving the target was also a problem. His imagination was neverending, even eating a cup of ramen was seen as a way to rouse his ( target’s) interest!\n\nXiang Han: This target is a no-go.\n\nCertain Target: Very good, you’ve already managed to rouse my interest. \n\nXiang Han: Go outside and make a left turn to the optometrist, go get your eyes healed! Additionally, this “lover provided” isn’t necessary.\n\nA Certain Target: This is certainly necessary!>"
