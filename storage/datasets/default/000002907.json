	"description": "Tong Yao woke up and found herself in an unfortunate situation.\n\nNot only did she transmigrate into a fantasy-romance novel that had been dropped by the author, but she also found herself in the body of a throwaway character that was fighting against the protagonist for a man!\n\nFor the sake of her survival, Tong Yao immediately reached forward to grab the protagonist’s leg.\n\n“Mistress, I was wrong!”>"
