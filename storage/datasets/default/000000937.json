	"description": "As a virtuous wife, does it include tolerating his cousin, enduring his concubines, bearing his mother?\n\nIf you will not let me live freely, why would I let you live in satisfaction?\n\nDid fate let women time-travel so they could learn the three morals and four virtues?\n\nRather than act like a coward and live, it would be better to live in satisfaction and die.>"
