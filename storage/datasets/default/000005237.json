	"description": "​​​​​​​This is a story set centuries after the Sol system crumbled and the old human went extinct. At least, this is what the crew of the Ark Continuum-5 are told.\r\n\r\nTo ensure humanity will continue to exist, the Continuum-5 began a journey across millennia. Although every post is essential, the hierarchy is ruled by meritocracy, yet skill and prowess are predisposed by genetics – you can say the destiny of every crew member has been set before they are even born.\r\n\r\nThis solid and cruel system is essential for the New World. At least, this is what the crew of the Ark Continuum-5 was taught.>"
