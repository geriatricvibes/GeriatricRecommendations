	"description": "The reign of the zombie queen ended, and her soul transmigrated into an ancient historical novel. She thought she could finally be a human and enjoy food. But, the stupid system sent by the heaven said–\n\n”Your food experience is over. You’re in a zombie state. I ask the host to work hard to gain hatred points of the male and female lead of the novel. Every 1 point of hate value can be exchanged for 1 minute of delicious food. Come on host!”\n\nLuo Fu: “… gain hatred points.  Sounds good!”\n\nThis is a story of a vicious female who constantly gains hatred but remains alive and eats happily.>"
