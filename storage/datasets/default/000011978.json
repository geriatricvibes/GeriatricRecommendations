Hurry up and fly away!\n\nNing Xin, she is the most idiotic of the idiotic rabbits, the most natural of the pure naturals. The first time she touched an online game, she skillfully created the rage-inducing, “highest quality,” character cursed by the heavens.\n\nAt a loss at how to level up, unable to even kill monsters, well, at least we can still dig.\n\nSystem Notification: Mo Shang is examining your equipment.\n\n[Just Now] Mo Shang: . . . .\n\n[Just Now] Ning Xin: ? ? ?\n\n[Just Now] Mo Shang: How did you survive this long?\n\n[Just Now] Ning Xin: Mining ores give experience, but leveling up is a little slow.\n\nAfter a seemingly endless wait, at last Mo Shang responded.\n\n[Just Now] Mo Shang: You are the deity here. . . . -_-lll\n\nNing Xin paid it no mind. She wasn’t able to become a deity; however, she could still support one.\n\n[Just Now] Ning Xin: Great God, how about I support you!\n\nFollowing her statement, thunder surged overhead. In this way, First Ranked Great God Mo Shang was successfully taken in by the natural little idiot. . . .>"
