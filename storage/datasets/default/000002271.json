	"description": "I’m a mediocre and healthy boy who attends a local public high school.\n\nBy chance, the reindeer took me to Santa’s House.\n\nI thought it was a dream, but apparently I was wrong, so I decided to help with Christmas.\n\nAs expected, I had graduated from Santa Claus.\n\nRudolph III, the reindeer that doesn’t read the air, is the one who launches the chain of events.\n\n4 hours a day ✕ 4 days. Until Christmas Eve has finished distributing the presents.\n\nYou’ll reward me properly, Santa Claus!!!!!>"
