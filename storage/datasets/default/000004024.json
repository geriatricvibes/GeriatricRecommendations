The church, wizards, investigators, saints...\n\nEvery summoning group had something they desired. And at the same time, they offered various sacrifices.\n\nShen Yi was overwhelmed with annoyance, but there was nothing he could do to put a stop to it.\n\nEventually, he was successfully summoned by cultists.\n\nAnd the first problem Shen Yi had to face was... A sacrificial little girl, who had slumped on the altar!>"
