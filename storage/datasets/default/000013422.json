	"description": "I, The Villain, Can Issue Tasks to the Heroine!\n\nWhat would it feel like for a villain to issue tasks to the heroine of a novel?\n\nTransmigrated into a novel world, Su Hang became a small villain and was bound to a God-Level Task Issuing System. He can issue tasks to the novel’s heroine to alter the plot.\n\nThen, an absurd scene occurred.\n\nThe original aloof ice-cold female CEO confessed to Su Hang, the villain, right before the Protagonist.\n\nThe female lead, indifferent to the Dragon King Son-In-Law Protagonist, wept bitterly to let her give birth to at least five children of Su Hang.\n\nFor a moment, all the Protagonists couldn’t help but become furious and question why.\n\nThe female lead replied, “It’s all just the Master’s task.”>"
