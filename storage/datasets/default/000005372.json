	"description": "“Can you get rid of your engagement with me?”\n\n“Okay, I understand… Just, one last thing… if that’s possible”\n\nNoah Spencer, son of a feudal Count, will be engaged to Grace Roland, daughter of another feudal Count. Grace has a villain’s face (?), but has an innocent personality and a hobby of drawing, the least one might expect. Because of her dazzling smiles every time she draws, Noah’s feelings are getting heavier and heavier, but it seems Grace is only focused on drawing.>"
