	"description": "When I tripped into another world, it was a world where there was no black hair. As a rare find, I have been presented to the rear palace as a tribute to the king of a neighboring country. A fast-paced woman tries to survive in the back palace in a world where she doesn’t know the language. It’s a story that moves all at its own pace.>"
