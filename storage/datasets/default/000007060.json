	"description": "Belinda Curtis is a training instructor for the Royal Knights that is well-known as a level-headed and blunt person.\n\nLet alone liking someone, she feels more content when no one can beat her. Thus, she’s currently desperate to have a crush.\n\n“Welcome to the Lion and Broomstick.”\n\nThen she’s facing the timid owner of a teahouse who resembles the light yellow Marisa flower.\n\n* * *\n\n‘I need to stay calm.‘\n\nThe moment Belinda consoled herself, one face crossed her mind. His fluffy wheat-colored hair, his clear gentle green eyes, his radiant smile, and his soft voice. A person who made her feel warm and joyful just by thinking of him. Being around him, she was completely able to take a break as a Knight or the daughter of a Count and became Belinda Curtis, a guest to drink his tea.\n\n“Ah, Rozen…”\n\nThe name she breathed out with a sigh, brought more longing.\n\n“I miss him real bad that I feel like I want to beat someone…”\n\nNeedless to say, the expression was way too aggressive.>"
