	"description": "My father, who's blind to power forced me to marry a sick emperor.\n\nHe’s so weak that he can’t even make it through the first night. She didn’t expect much when she entered in the bedroom but…\n\n“Oh, dear.”\n\nThere were fallen assassins everywhere and my husband, who was covered in blood held a sword against me.\n\n“You’ve been caught.”\n\n“……”\n\n“I thought you wouldn’t come.”\n\nApparently, my sick husband is too healthy for some reason.\n\n—-\n\n“I think you’re healthy enough now, so I’m leaving.”\n\nShe raised her head with a polite greeting, but on other hand her husband’s expression is not good.\n\n'Leaving? Where?'\n\n'Well, I’m thinking of using my powers to set up a hospital.'\n\nI carefully stuck out our divorce contract. And then—\n\n(Sfx : clap!)\n\nMy husband ripped the divorce contract with an expressionless face.\n\nI looked at my husband with a dumbfounded look.\n\nIs this guy crazy?!\n\n“W-what are you doing?”\n\nMy husband opened his mouth after a long silence.\n\n“I think I’m still sick, Meredith.”>"
