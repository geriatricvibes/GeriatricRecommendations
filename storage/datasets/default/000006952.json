	"description": "“Why should I only marry one man?” the  female emperor declared. \n\n“In past generations, the emperor has had at least five concubines, and an average of fifteen. Now that I am emperor, I should have at least five concubines too. The son of a chancellor? The successor to a powerful family? If they are good, send them to the harem. \n\n“My favorite one will become the male empress.”>"
