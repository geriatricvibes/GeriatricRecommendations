	"description": "Before the wedding, her fiancé had an affair.\n\nSo she got a new fiancé to break up…\n\nBut there is a little problem.\n\n[You said he was a killer?]\n\n[There’s a rumor that he’s a wreck.]\n\n[Some people fainted because they were scared during the conversation.]\n\nLilia stared at her new fiancé, who was carrying all kinds of bad rumors.\n\nKarhan, holding a little puppy in his arms, lowered his eyes as if he were about to be scolded.\n\n“Lilia…. I took this puppy because it was raining outside.”\n\n…..Is this engagement okay?\n\n***\n\nShe was walking to the Orgel store she bought last time. Lilia was surprised to see the incredibly long line.\n\n“What……?”\n\nSomething new came out?\n\nWas it not that, or was the product released by a limited sale?\n\nLilia walked slowly along the line like salmon against the river.\n\nIt turned out that the origin of the string was Lilia’s Orgel shop.\n\n‘How long ago was it so quiet?’\n\nEmbarrassed, Lilia looked around and grabbed a man and asked, “Can you tell me why everyone is in line?”\n\nThen the young man kindly explained.\n\n“This time, a popular actor placed a ring in a music box and proposed a marriage. After the rumors, the music box became a necessity for the proposal.”\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nShe hit the jackpot again.>"
