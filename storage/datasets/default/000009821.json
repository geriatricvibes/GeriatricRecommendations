	"description": "Top actress Lee Sia with the ability to see ghosts.\r\n\r\nAfter the accident, he wakes up from the body of ‘Camila Sorpel’.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that\r\n\r\n“Oh, father! Help me!”\r\n\r\nThe end of this woman is death every time!\r\n\r\nExtending the lifeline is a priority, so let’s start by talking to the ghosts here first, shall we?\r\n\r\n“You will get a divorce soon.”\r\n\r\n“… what?”\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in the conference hall became quiet again at the word that was uttered like a hum.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to say now… … !”\r\n“Your servant’s wife.”\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment was evident on the face of the other person in the following words.\r\n\r\n“She is also the wife of a subordinate whom she cherishes the most.”\r\n“Uh, what… … !”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard of my rumors?”\r\n\r\nCamilla smiled and took a step closer.\r\n\r\n“They say that the princess of the Sorpel family is looking at some fortune-telling.”>"
