	"description": "I possessed the villainess in the novel. It was even a romance fantasy that I wrote myself 10 years ago.\n\nThe villainess, Ayla, is destined to be killed by the male lead while cursing the female lead. \n\nThat means it's okay if I don't turn out to be villainess, right?\n\n 'I'm going to spend the rest of my life playing rich and unemployed!'\n\nHowever,\n\nAs I began to fool around, the day suddenly began to turn around. \n\nThe reason for that was because I didn't act like a villainess?!\n\nI don't want to die! \n\n'Please stop the loop...….” \n'The method is simple. You just have to be a real villainess .' \n'Real villainess?' \n'Wealth, power, honor, man, take everything away.'\n\nThen a dangerous-looking sorcerer came to me. \n\n'If you want, I'll take her crown and gladly put it over your head, and lead you to the throne...'\n\nHe whispered the devilish sweet words into her ears with a gentle voice. \n\n'So, what's your answer?' \n\nWill I be able to stop the loop and become a real villainess?>"
