	"description": "“From the moment I first saw you, I wanted to make you cry.”\n\nYoongun is a man with no emotions. His underdeveloped affection is obsessive and unnecessarily cruel. In front of a certain woman, he becomes a sly, wild beast.\n\n“I love him… but I hate him just as much.”\n\nKyuyoung is a woman who represses her own emotions. She’d lose herself in a series of dilemmas created by a certain someone.\n\nCan she ever extricate herself from the man who is both the root of her suffering and her life’s savior?\n\nBetween seasons… the hot and cold months that held them prisoner.>"
