	"description": "Violet Abton, daughter of the notorious swindler. One day, when she tried to live with her dad, failed and was hiding, she picked up a man who had fallen in the woods.\r\n\r\n'... Who am I?'\r\n\r\n'You are my servant.'\r\n\r\nIt was good until she cheated on a man who had lost his memory as a servant, and pampered him, but that man is the Duke of Hessen!\r\n\r\n“I'll return it a hundred times for what you did to me. I appoint you as my dedicated maid. '>"
