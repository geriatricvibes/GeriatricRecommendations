	"description": "At the Tristain Magic Academy, her classmates call bumbling witch-in-training Louise Francoise le Blanc de la Valliere “Louise the Zero.” During an important coming-of-age ritual, when each student must summon their own witch’s familiar, Louise confirms her classmates’ opinion by accidentally conjuring up a normal teenage boy from Japan. Whether the two of them like it or not, the laws of magic bind them as master and servant forever! A hilarious novel with romance interwined.>"
