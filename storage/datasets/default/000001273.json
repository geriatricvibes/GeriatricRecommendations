	"description": "Just overnight, her father’s youngest brother becomes her husband. She grinds her teeth with hate and embarrassment! \n\nHis thin lips curl into a smile. He slowly takes off his suit and tie. \n\n“Don’t do it, Uncle. It’s my fault…” \n“Uncle, how can you peek while someone’s showering!?” \n“I was peeking at you.” \n“Uncle, how can you snatch your buddy’s woman?” \n“I was snatching you.” \n“Uncle, can you be any more ruthless?” \n\nHe’s the king of A City, but he has to come up with every possible means to wrap her in his arms. \n\nHe has waited patiently for her to come of age, only for her to be infatuated with his good friend. \n\nIn order to win her heart, he is willing to try everything in his means. If it made him unscrupulous, so be it!>"
