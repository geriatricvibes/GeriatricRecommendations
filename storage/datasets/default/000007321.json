	"description": "Soon after the youngest son in the Fang family was born, he was taken away by a human trafficker and ended up in a small village. Ten years later, his biological parents found him and took him back. Fang Yan followed his parents back to the capital city while holding all his possessions--one chicken, one duck and a basket of eggs. There was nothing bad about the city except a lack of land. Fortunately, he had his mobile space.>"
