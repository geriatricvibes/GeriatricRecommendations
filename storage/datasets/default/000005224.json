	"description": "By the time I noticed, I was staring at the hands of a baby.\n\nIt seems like for some reason, I got myself reincarnated.\n\nI also knew that I posses great power (Physical).\n\nHowever, I was born in a really small peaceful village,\n\nand there’s no place for me to demonstrate that power.\n\nI’m also able to make friends with someone, but she was born with a sickly body…\n\nI tried doing various things in order to grasp my power,\n\nwhat I thought at that time was 『I want to go on an adventure freely』.\n\nIncidentally, when went to the capital I raised a fuss, why won’t you let me do whatever I want?\n\nAnd that’s where everything began.>"
