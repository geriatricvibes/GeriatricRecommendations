	"description": "He is the renowned playboy that terrifies the world, and countless people’s supreme king.\n\nA night was turned upside down as she recklessly pushed him down on the bed, her face clear and cold: Remember, you’re bottom, I’m top!\n\n“Offending me, aren’t you afraid I’ll kill you?”\n\n“Not afraid. You wouldn’t. ”\n\nLittle by little pressing his bottom line, time by time declaring her sovereignty.\n\nShen Shenxue’s principle is: Even if the entire world spoiled him, she absolutely had to domesticate him into a loyal dog.\n\nQuan Shi: There’s people who love your beautiful and alluring image, there’s people who love your rich spirit, and only I hate your never conceding stubbornness and your endless passionate, deep love.\n\nNote: The title’s a play on words, and the words ‘how have you been?’ is meant to be said with a malicious intent behind it (alternate title translation would be, ‘Hope You’ve Been Unwell’ for the latter portion)>"
