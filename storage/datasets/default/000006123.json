	"description": "When Shen Zhifan awoke, he had become the nation’s male god.\n\nThe type of male god that everyone in the world, crying and shouting, wants to marry.\n\nHowever, because the General (who lives next door) has a fiancee who fell in love with Shen Zhifan, the General absolutely hates him.\n\nShen Zhifan, who has always thought of the General as his male god, was crushed.\n\n*My Male God has become my rival in love. Every day his ice-cube face looks like he desperately wants to hack me to death.*\n\n*Esteemed General, I don’t even have a sliver of affection for your fiancee. I’ve long given up any hope of love – right now, I just want to get rich.*\n\nLuckily, the General’s cat really likes him, and always wants to……climb into his bed.>"
