	"description": "Gu Yixin became the cannon fodder in a book.\n\nIn the original book, the cannon fodder designed the villain to make himself pregnant and married into a wealthy family but was retaliated against later.\n\nGu Yixin opened his eyes and lay on the villain’s bed, a 1.9-meter super cool and super handsome president pressed him down with a cool and domineering look.\n\nThen Gu Yixin overthrew the president, it felt indescribable.\n\nLu Mingshi, a wealthy tycoon, was a famous celebrity. He had never been close to women or men. Many people suspect that he had problems in that aspect.\n\nUntil one day, the boss blocked his 18-year-old babysitter on the construction site and lifted his tailored handmade shirt to reveal his slightly raised belly. “I’m pregnant, come back with me.”\n\nGu Yixin: “?” It didn’t seem to be what it told in the book.>"
