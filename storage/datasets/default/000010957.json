	"description": "Qi Huan and Qu Jianshen grew up together since childhood, and even though Qu Jianshen had a face more handsome than any male star in the entertainment industry, she never had any other thoughts about him. \n\nShe didn’t until she was told by her parents that they had been engaged by her grandfather’s generation. \n\nQi Huan’s first thought was to refuse, but no one wanted to cancel a marriage contract made by the elders. So she asked her best friend to help her come up with ideas to make Qu Jianshen to refuse too, so that maybe her parents’ side will give up.>"
