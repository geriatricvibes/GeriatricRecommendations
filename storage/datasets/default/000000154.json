	"description": "I think that was the moment when everything started to change.\r\n\r\nI don’t know why but I had never liked anyone in all those years. Even though I liked men, I had never taken a liking to any.\r\n\r\nI thought it was out of sympathy and pity at that time.\r\n\r\nBut someone once said that love stemming from sympathy and pity is actually more down-to-earth. I think it was Zheng Zhihua talking about his wife.>"
