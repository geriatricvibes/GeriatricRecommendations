Unfortunately, the attention that she yearned for was stolen by the family’s fake heiress – her elder sister, Su Ruowan. \r\n\r\nAs a result of Su Ruowan’s evil plans, Shen Xi was crippled, disfigured and eventually died of leukemia. However, in a surprising turn of events, Shen Xi was reborn. Returned to the time when she was a seventeen-year-old teenager, she’ll set things right and get her revenge against the Su family. \r\n\r\n>"
