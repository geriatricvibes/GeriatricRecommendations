	"description": "Morita Naoto spends his days avoiding falling for another girl ever since he was strongly rejected by a girl he confessed to. \n\nOn the winter of his second year in high school, Naoto came to learn about the troubles of Oshida Natsuki, his childhood friend and neighbor in the same apartment complex. They’ve been estranged for many years, but for some reason Naoto can’t help but worry for Natsuki, so he offered to help her. \n\nHowever, on his first day of helping Natsuki, Naoto can’t provide proper support, and on the second day he can’t come up with any idea at all. This cause Naoto to worry that he is being useless to Natsuki. \n\nDespite it all, to show her gratitude, Natsuki offered Naoto her lap as a pillow, cleaned his ears, and promised to go out with him on Christmas Day. This caused Naoto to realize his feelings. \n\nTheir relationship that had stood still began to change, and just like the old days, Naoto and Natsuki held their hands together. This time for sure, forevermore.>"
